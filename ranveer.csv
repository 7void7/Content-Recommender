like how is it different from the rest of your life the last ten years have been the root cause of all what I did this before ok it's like when you when you construct a building you have a foundation and mosttime must be spent on building the foundation CA Foundation strong than all the other building blocks on top of it can be built in the later stage so I think 15 years in the monastery in the Ashram were more of the foundation and the last ten years been the building blocks in terms of reaching out creating content which can be shared with the world what I learnt my experiences and trying to see how it canout there and helped transform in Patuli been more of the building blocks partner beautiful India childhood did you ever imagine that you'll be doing what you doing right now send your pic to yourself like this in my child picture myself as a person who be up there in the screen I don't think I am picture myself as a person who is going to be a social media influencer I didn't think I pictured myself as a leader I did picture myselfsomebody who would try to make some difference in some backed impact some difference some impacts somewhere and I think it also came from being surrounded by people like those I grew up in the middle class family in a small town near Pune and the I remember your neighbourhood we had a gentleman was a school teacher and at least four days a week in the eveningMini student would come to his home for like classes English grammar and spoken English in this students were from Vernacular background and a later I found out that the gentleman doesn't charge it was purpose to make a difference to the skids by having the learning Yash when I grow up I had just around where I left was a group of youngsters I would say like in the age group of about 18 to 24 24 2415268 them with the mums every single time the mums would cook rice the mums would have to take a fistful of rice and put it on the path letter box and once in the month 20 50 people would bring all the rows together gather some money from their parents make some Khichdi aur dal and rice sambar and rice veg biryani something and go to the destitute go to the homeless go to the needy and the poor andyou know and then I saw my own dad at home with these guys would do it like selflessly just giving in this you know they didn't have the money but they will collect in doing something my dad to work for the Meteorological Department of India and the I remember seeing my dad paid for the job but really wanting to do it so well that he would stay extra was at work sometimes we would go on weekly off days to go anddo his work well so that someone somewhere get the benefit of fortunate and grateful to be surrounded by some good examples of people who had it for free overpaid but it so well they all wanted to make a difference and an impact on their own in fact such was the experience of it as a way of studying Engineering I decided I have to try something like that so I went around and found to 10th grade studentswho is really poor financially but way to Puran mathematics so I asked them if I could cost them in the mathematics and for one complete year I thought the mathematics 2 hours a day every single day 365 days and then charged them and it very well at maths seeing that smile on their face and their parents in the gratitude to the parentsthe first hand experience of Wanted makes two word means to make a difference what it means to make an impact in this way the taste the pudding is in eating at you can talk about it we could listen to some is good read books we could have so much around it tasted first hand I think so that how much childhood was normal child in a middle class family but is fortunate and grateful to be surrounded by some good examples of people were trying their best toyou know make that can't come back to give back to back understood perfectly your pudding tasting analogy near but what did you taste in the monastery of prior to the Monsters and what what made you think that ok I wanna I wanna now put this world here and on enter that way I think the pudding at least before the ministry was appearing of Greyachievements ok I've been University topper practically every semester seen the best vocalist and guitarist so when you enter into an Auditorium full of people in a start singing starts tracking some chords on the guitar Academy clear doing well pick the Hewlett Packard for great job so this to the printing of achievementstaste the feeling of control power to the feeding of people respecting in bed bending down value from their right to popular in that sense and then I come to the monastery and it's quite amazing yesterday's doing another podcast with someone and this gentleman was telling me that his friend close friend from Delhiis like a music Prodigy when was about 10 years old he mastered 35 musical instruments any set grew up and moved Mumbai to get into the field of Music and asset entry Mumbai was humbling because it was so someone and entered into the city which is filled with creative people probably learnt 80 instruments won the fightyou know any set it is a very humbling Experience so it is to the pudding of all of this and I moved into the ministry with that baggage with the dash of the theory I am academic success here I am a corporate success your I am abc.xyz and I come into the ministry and you're surrounded by x** the monks were the similar ages you are all detail and each one of them from excellent academicprobably some of them a gold medalist in their field had great corporate experience and now spiritual experience and when I entered into the monastery the pudding I tasted first was humility it was more forced humility because it coming with a bag that you or someone and you enter into the space and you realise they thought I was someone and suddenly the whole bubble busts openin the popular opinion and then I my good training from my Guru land The Other monks around there I learnt how humility such an incredible quality of one's spiritual growth personal growth professional growth in any space want to grow humility is such an incredible foundational premise you know because humility and tales that you're kind of except for you say thatno that I don't know it all you know true knowledge is knowing you not knowing that you don't know it all ego says I know it all and humility says I know that I don't know it all humility says I know I'm good at something but I am not the best of everything and everyone in the world so I went there and I really like this so many people around was way better and that acceptance that they are better pave the way to learning but don't sayif you think you're the best person in the room on the smartest person through a problem in the wrong room you know so that was the taste the pade the first is to the product you know that the taste was he ok everything control everything is going to come here and you realise a vitamin A this so many people are way better than you know so much more was way more qualified than you are studied at the college of engineering Punefantastic very renowned and well known college me and monks in the monastery from IIT Mumbai in seconds to IIT Mumbai to get into that space into that attitude of you knowknowing that I don't know it all in knowing that I am not the best beautiful everyone already super youth fuelled question have seen the movie call Doctor Strange Marvel movie about this doctor from his hands get injured in an accident we can't be a surgeon and even so he searches all over the world for a cure and Sandy something cause them to Nepal is something takes into Nepal the use of you know the healerscentres like this so-called monastery realises that weight these guys are on some other level of spiritual he was a man of science in the world is spirituality is destroyed his whole scientific believe it's totally with my story real life Doctor Strange but for the youth to gain from those monksThe Monster when you realise that ok this is how perspectives can be weight that medistra my own perspective Abhinay pampered boy you know middle class family would only son had a younger sister but the only son Marwadi Jain family is your like really pampered FB thing I wanted was given everything I asked for was right there and spoilt brat in that sense I never Ranbir and never everlife at me at home if it wasn't made according to what I asked for only ate at home if what I asked for was good and I come here to the Ashram to the monastery and I can't use my means what was cooked in the community kitchen and serve to everybody on going to have to eat that right and trust meback in the Dev Maharashtra ministry didn't have enough money for 5 days a week they got the same vegetable the cheapest one and that was the curry with some rice and dal initial my mind was like rebelling come from a family of pampered and then I come here in everything you likeconfirm registry today was available and then I realised what did I come here for you in the monastery of the Ashram for luxurious fine palatable food order come here for a purpose which is much larger than these little things around my life and then the more I started tuning into my sense of purpose something we are higher than 20 lookI realised that those things won't bothering me that much you know not to say that they didn't bother me at all that would be happy to say that it didn't bother me at all but didn't bother me as much because now my attention was on something that I came in here for always tell people especially the youth don't allow your mind to be distracted from what your purpose is what your goal is all what you go through as in the ups and downsis only an outcome of taking your eyes off you go so the lack of facility should under pressure and the presence of luxury and facilitation and distract us so then there was lack of facility today there is a bundles of facility in a monastery in nrc bill in South Mumbai outdoor pool surrounded by luxury all over the place so then back in there was nothing and today the so muchbut because the attention is on the purpose at that time I learnt from my training and from experience there that I could actually take a lot in my stride because I kept shifting my attention to what I was meant to do with was what which was a to deepen my own spiritual calling and B was to see how to strategize to share that experience you'll experience with wealthkept bringing my tension constituted by so if you want to decode my learning from the monster coder my spiritual pad particularly for the you keep your attention and focus constantly on what you meant to do in life which basically means is a need to discover what you want to do in life if you haven't discovered the smallest trivia can disturb you have discovered a new focusthe largest setbacks can be handled and even take it means tried and 100% I feel that even throughout the darkest places of my own career which are usually happen because something happened my personal life that the spine of the curry always put you back too much work to be done can't afford to clients to another person and I think life is going to always be up and I absolutely so you just gotta keep going Assalam rewind you back a little bit toofree monastery days how old were you when this all this happened like when it between T1 ok I just work with people I got 8 months ok and you realise that hold on the something bigger call me you got the monster in you realise ok this is it it is the beginning of it this is the exploring and ok I have been a non conformist you know you cannot do anything substantially pure conformist the greatest killer of your personal spiritual professional growth is confirmationconfirm that simple for the the greatest killer of a growth is to give into what society thinks you should be doing social standard reward you should be doing social it's cool to have a job or business started this way and have a home in a certain place at a certain coronavirus in kind of clothes and some kind of hairstyle and be given to it because we want to be socially accessthere is also the other side of the story which is pressure from family parents were there is confirmation in giving in there because what is my parents think Mere parents name Idli Itna Kiya Bachpan Se Mujhe Kiya Hai Mere Papa Ka Sapna Tha Main engineer Bano Meri Mummy Ka Sapna Mein doctor banvari hai aur vah aapki Jindagi Nahin Dene Wale not saying wish fulfill our parents names with the most amazing people they gave birth to us the groupit's so much for us and we have that that it I hate use the wood duty per I still use it duty of a genuine love and gratitude to serve them and their emotional support the love will always be there for us but trust me if you refuse to the BF to spend like about 8 hours at work daily to be conservative number actually spend be more than that but if it is felt like it was a work daily and workingthis sporty how is it worked a week and assuming you take two weeks of holiday every year at 15 weeks working the mix 2019 of yours at work you mean you work for about 45 years the 90000 hours of your life at work not a daunting number it the averages about ten years of your life I'm really not sure if I just confirmPintu what socially acceptable about my family wants 50,000 hours of dissatisfaction 90000 hours of cribbing in complaining that I I don't like it this is know what I wanted to do what to do this is what range this is what pains what my parents wanted conformism confirm is number take away 12 things from me a my satisfactionjust because it's paying me more should I be miserable for the night that when you do something thatfor me I said no man hpsm ok good doing it is good very decent be good at my work but not fulfilling me and I don't suggest people take a risk like me definitely don't I usually tell people that you have a mainstream something to which you can then follow your passion side by side with no risks involved calculated risk and when this takes over in gross then check this outwishes you mean think my my system then allow me to do that can take the calculated risk I just took the plunge and jumped in and say no I'm not going to do this if it doesn't really kind of resonate with myself in USA Bina nonconformist Mein Samaja aisa bolata hai my family will hurt with that obviously they would ride but now that they see what it has come out to be againJenny like that is when something similar right I think honestly is right from the time engineering got done from Family full of doctors in our 16 and told me that I know you bad up to medicine these four generations of doctor expecting V want to become a doctor can I donate blood save our be an engineer so even though was a huge deal and cried after Engineering College when I tried doing YouTube it was a massively difficult thing to explain to my parents that there is thisgold YouTube and make money off eventually so what I did for the first two years was that I'd like to the metal them working on a Startup it was the start of the line and eventually the friend came and told them that you know I just saw your son on YouTube what happening and then my parents ask me another awards training people bagmusa was meeting money materials expandingwhat happened so I am a monitor glad I didn't confirm but some more interested in your monastery as of now what was the day like there that what do you do like from morning that's what is it to like that monks get up at 3 a.m. ok my regular day starts at anywhere between 3 and 4 4:15 ine today even today you most days but if I had a late nightthat landed late would mean goes to one or two hours later but usually never after sex between 3:30 and half 4 o'clock that is so that when the day begins and then we have a group meditation sessions in the Ashram where we all come together which goes all the way till 7:15 and then put that is breakfast then all of us come together to discussdiscussions on structure and spiritual principles that takes all the fatal 9 9:15 post that is time for yourself some absences and Organisation institution different people do different things like what responsiveness admin there there is there are online courses the people are looking into the digital platform people looking at you know guests coming in such as a guest reception in the guests were coming in this is the date is in the Murti MithunWestside today on any given day we have at least about 400 people take me to certified so this whole variety of things that govern their people get into their respective areas of service work could be called a launcher on 12 12 13 then after that again the monks come together some discussions and then some of them go out in the evening to share this message with different University students awesome awesomesocial media and coronavirus my next point So I did all of this years back the last I would select three and after 45 years this is not my life now my life is turned to more towards you know online sweets always creating content and then I travel a lot my average number of lights near about 150 and 180 in one particular write about 280 flights years lawwhen Jet Airways went bust in one year ahead but what $450,000 miles over mistake you know what you want you travelling for events for corporate events I am I am really really very active the property to trying to bring these spiritual values into business in a lot of Corporate heads and I'm interested in how spiritual values can be brought into business especially creating the right work Ethicthe right person the organisation I do a lot of these events and partly my time is also taken by one on one life coaching very few people but I do spend time with them to hand hold them to come to where they want to do a valve evolve Soya that takes a lot of my time away you meditate before bed like before sleep in my meditation is before but my meditation is gratitude practice like me your prayer every eveninggo to bed is the practice of gratitude accounting all the things that happened in the day and being grateful for everything that happened consciously practice gratitude and eventually this becomes a part of your anyways here and the first thing in the morning as soon as I am aap is also beginning my day with gratitude and of course have a specific time meditation as well which I spend an hour of everyday what do you do in your meditation because you know the so many different kinds of meditation it so what does someone like you do temeritywhen I came to the ministry the meditation I was taught was Mantra meditation chanting and beads by chanting mantra and as I began the process I realised how challenging it was to be present in to the sound of the mantra and to be totally in a space in a zone of heartlessness weather isbothering you mind and present and listening to the sound in totally absorbed in the sound I realise that it was a massive Uphill task and I think it comes to the challenge comes from the fact that we got so used to multitasking determined functions on 20 tracks so when we just on the meditation track the 19 other tracks to deal with you know yourrelationship issues a professional issues with so many things going into this is coming from family so much going on in the country so much that's occupying a mental space actually want to get onto the track of Meditation by putting all of this the backseat it become practically impossible and unblock people tell me the event that trying to meditate this is what happens to them and I share my joining them this is exactly what happened to me when I started25 years now every single day without 1 days gap one of half hours every day and I can I tell them that it's not that is not a challenge today if would be very high had to say that every state of enlightenment when I said for meditation everything is kind of their and am totally observe that I will say that it a few things that I feel can benefit those who want to really get into that a deeper state meditation Iare looking meditation in two ways a is the meditation meditation is in the practice and b is everything that we do in our life as meditation and I prefer to work more on everything in my life is a meditation which feeds into my practice meditation but I do not neglect the practice practice for sure so I tell you why do for instance one meal a day I just by myself to memy friend my some of my mongmong friends we discussed at least one mail is just by myself the reason being I want to be present mindful in the moment you say with the entire experience touching feeling smelling tasting that food avoid forks and spoons as much as possible because I want to touch and feel that experience of the food know the reason I do it is because it is means no phones nobownobody to talk to and just being their own doing is by just eating that one meal by myself raining my mind been the present like we're talking now but three meetings lined up me tonight and the restaurant Candy and green Z Bridge Candy family is a very close friend you know so they've just opened up new rooftop Terrace in getting message of to message to come down today evening but it's not my mindit's not my my nothing outside of a conversation between you and me right now is on my mind so why do I do it is because night Naam training my mind being the present price to be in the bathroom I would sing big thing for me you stupid single or cinema movie songs and now I think Sab spiritual song bhajan whatever they don't realise they wait a minute this is because neither mice into theNorma into the experience of wearing Singh am missing the expense of bidding and FM bidding I'm not into my singing so I am I doing two things at the same time as top singer just focusing on the experience of the water coming on my body and spirit Singh message to meet these Little Things through the day matter a lot to me and I think that sell that's more meditation to me what I dofeeds into my mainstream practice of meditation and what I do your feeds into the lighting is well which kind of a loop one field into other but specifically in the practice could you expand on like what you do right now that today after you've been on the path for so long us today what is your meditation exit the same thing is if you bring back your focus into one place yes it is the same thing even today winning my focus back into one place which is thisMantra think to me it's not doing new things is doing the same things rightly there that's what really brings results we don't need to try new things into a practice if we have a practice and we focus on a practice and keep doing it running at finding it constantly start paying back if you're creating content I have to try new things keep learning atslim space back in whatever I want to add two things you missed the code from Bruce Lee said the magnetic field is not he who practiced 10,000 kicks once but he practices one kick 10,000 times so that one can the second thing is I feel just because the climate of the country right now as a political climate and all this a lot of people kind of look down on the practice meditation as being like something overly religious or you know you mention the word Mantra automaticallypeople especially in open Central kind of drought negative connotation the command of you saying that other religions on good that the whole lot of people think in singer remember that meditation for use on Mantra but you can also just simply focus on your breath you can focus on a Mantra from your own religion like a Chand from your own religion people fail to understand and keeping and mind my next question is that you face any kind ofnot finding a better word for this but you face any kind of disrespect or enter backlash for the colour you wear or for the dikhaiye wearing new face any kind of this agreement or se operate Patan peoples aise hi brezza automatic review experience this I think it was kind of like that when I just start my journey of sharing it with the corporate world there was a little bit of naturally this respect would be a strong word in this comeproblem college discomfort that this guy doing everything and plus mire tire is like a religious time invention have big thing on my head for my everything like what religious I think over a period of time people have seen the content will be sharing online which has nothing to do with religion which is nothing to do with any faith which has nothing to do with anything of that sort it all out all our content is completelylead to life and humans humans and wisdom that can transform your life so which is precisely why a following online is every secular following people from all space all nationalities all genders all kind of sexualities everybody following us because nobody feels intimidating nobody feels threatened that ok I am is back and trying to impose certain pay the religious belief Honours sowhen to do is very faith and religion agnostic actually which is precisely why people are kind of noun now seen us that this is not who is the discomfort is totally on God so people don't feel that any longer but what is the significance of the saffron and what is the significance ofcame up to me and said you fever colour to explain to him the one hand and in the Hindu tradition and when somebody leave this world the crematedconsumed by the Flames of fire in Saffron on actually means that I am dead to my own personal injury claims of fire consumes my own selfish and now on my life is meant to be for the betterment and welfare of others to killing your own ego Kaling yawning and its kind of now living for others that's what is meant to be a lifelong journey to live by it in that it signifySaffron also is like your saffron is encasa saffron strands Saffron strands if you were added saffron stand prep usually find first Rose To The Beat on pen in a pan to take the moisture of and the new tikli buttermilk in heart in 1 litre milk and start living all the colour in the fragrance and flavour and I had to apply for your petat the 728 so if you compare someone's life to Saffron strands it also means to believe it crystal bedroom still but by life to be able to add colour fragrance and flavour to lives in a so that's what it really means of course long way to go to be able to live like that but that's what signifies your own experience sharing at the same time killing of the ego here is that why monks also save the headpart of this both sides not like in both since some people have long hair manksar long hair long beards is well and some Monk shape of their heads a Buddhist monks will shave their heads of you know the question of eight months we shave their heads up at you'll find many months but long hair is the long long beards I think either of which have a it's a practice of detachment like a few shaving head of means of you here is annew like you know you groom your hair will give yourself looks ok I am kind of going about rising above it and if you see monks who have long hair and Long Beach City that the sense of detachment and I don't care grooming names you don't find monks were like you know have long hair in the go to salons to conduct style both kind of significance of detachment from your personal life and your body lick and concept and ask you about the tikalike this particular source follow the Christian faith so if you go to church Temple mosque in this place is the version you will see or even a government organisation for that matter you will see if Lagane Emblem write the top to the Parliament you see any government building as a flag on sense that this propertybelongs to the Government of India you know Temple this property belongs to temple aur Los corrector Chhori so this kind of this kind of Mark put right on top kind of signifies that you are now living a life which is the difference of affiliation to certain fate got so this is now for the creation of a some people will put it like this and the Islamic faith will have a cab available have a sweet marker set me offJammu State question will have a certain the problem put across an exciting kind of ritual yesterday I was even talking about this to somebody an amazing one sometime I asked me London something as me what is the need for rituals in religion you know which your faith and I said to him why we will talk about religious rituals a part of religion rituals are a part of life like 2 weeks back Valentine's Dayguys went to girls giving the rose flowers giving Rose to girls attitude that conveys how you feel to that girl saying I love you language is a ritual languages ritual to meant to help you communicate the feelings of your heart to the person whom you are communicating to giving gift to someone is a ritual birthday gifts tells the person that ok if you mean a lot to mebirthday song of cutting a birthday cake is telling the other person Birthday man united Chelsea apply again and Man United Way Wembley stadium is normal in glory glory man you like everybody singing ritual that song tells the man united team how much is the offence adore them this guy in London I don't think it's about religious life is full of ritualsgoing to a girl giving her rose and saying I love you honey and not meaning it at all it if you see the first three letters of the word spirit their SP you add the first three letters SPR to ritual in become spiritual know as soon as the first three letters with me the spirit is goneyou have some weird rituals are coming in saying to girl I love you without meaning it is ritual that really men from the deepest ko of the heart of The Spiritual Experience so I think every faith like every aspect of life will have means to communicate their field to whether the cal God with the called Universe with the collet energy with the power of the recorded nothing anonyme what is the meansMere Khet you genuine feelings and that's when then this different which was kind of come into existence so whether it's a mark on the forehead for bidding on a certain kind of a taiyar certain kind of practice at your door SOL meant to be able to express the but once the spirit is gone the what we have is a set of rituals which is what mawrellous religion kind of today is seen as and which is why a lot of youth doesn't even wantthat's why because this is simply a set of weird rituals without the spirit the being Ne breaking up we can actually get deeper into the spirit behind it is a lot of it will actually start making a lot like why do you think we see especially in our country a big reason the youth is not for spirituality is a concern was because a lot of the youth associate spirituality with the whole you know the Baba kawhy do you think that baba culture exists in the first place and secondary how can we get that section of youth back and understanding the true meaning of spirituality firstly we were talking about religion and spirituality Roy in very fashionable to say these days you know I am not religious and you know the meaning of the word still not being condescendingI am not religious some very spiritual people even know what does fineliner I don't think there's a difference between religion and spirituality in the spirit is existing you know ritual is also spiritual but also the spirit is gone that's ritualistic village so I think with the question about Baba culture in APbitlife we need mentors guides teachers Gurus like if I were to learn singing I would need someone from the Hindustani decided music of the Karnatak side music teach me what music you have exceptional people like Ranu Mondal who is like you know on this station railway station somewhere singing gifted these are people work problem gifted never train with exceptions the general rule is we need to be caused the mentoring to learning something right isI don't think spirituality is an exception is in no way we need Gurus of guides of mentors who will teach us and leaders on to that path now the issue is when the spiritual leaders of coaches of gurus of mentors become the focal point the centre point and The Spiritual wisdom that their teaching was at the back seat when it becomes cultistCult Cult is with this figure becomes the centre and the message and the practice in the wisdom is the black contrast that with the wisdom coming to the front and the person saying ok I am here delete you are here to train you am here to guide you with this is what you should be connecting to bacterial Guru bacterial Guru wisdom is your real Guru I am simply the mouthpiece am simply the microphone yes because I am the front pagetext me yes because I am a front PC could be attracted to me because I'm a front face you going to connect to me but this way beyond me something way beyond me wisdom knowledge spiritual forces powers and assembly represent them have teachers in Gurus and Guides you do that I don't think the youngsters have a problem with that dollar they don't deny the fact that we need mentors this is trying this is frustrating disgruntledback back like this power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely and you know trust me the power that spiritual leaders can have nobody in the world can have the simple reason being there were announced alot they had money Bade opportunities you know the parallel to the side and took to a life like this so you will have the biggest industrial is the biggest in the cinema world biggest the scorecoming to the sports with the spiritual leaders and sitting at the feet and seeking diets you know when our money followers come to you even if you started with the Nobel purpose easy to kind of get carried away our Sons I feel like you're second part the question was what do we do to pull them back in them back I think we need spiritual leaders who are not attached to their face were not attached to their name or notjust their Institutions we need spiritual leaders who are truly truly wanting to bring Wellness into the world and people look kind of cli process and se allocation about me it's about what I'm trying to teach and even then what I'm trying to take it's up to you if you want to choose this part is no imposition I think you have that kind of an aspect available here I do feel that the youngsters will Kinder be back many more separatelyto thank you what is the first is that I genuinely believe that we are moving into an age that we are seeing more ethicals parallel leaders in the second I want to add is a learning of mine since I left college in 5 years in the records and the one beginning of my life has been that throughout your life you are given a lot of tests it and you are usually ethical test think that tests your behaviour things that test what you doing a particular situation but the thing is if you choose to be on a spiritual paththe nature what happens to life is that the frequency of the test increases given more and more tests and more difficult as we say if you do become a spiritual leader person you are given that power so then it easier to get your way it easier to do the unethical thing because it the more fun things to do for now I'll or spiritual leaders but I believe is that they initially started the correct sentence start with the intent of spreading wisdom but as they themselves grow spiritually life test them and Maryfeel that is and that's why you see downfalls or Europe if someone retains a power using is underpass that S and I also believe that even the spiritual leader is a hundred and twenty years old he still going to get S even then what would you have to say that I am saying and I think there are two three kinds of people in the spiritual some come on the partythe come to make this is a profession OK then not spiritual leaders at all this is that it works well easy way out to spot that how do you say that happeningkind of totally tuned into the purpose can get carried away go astray maybe come back maybe not available and pass the test of time in a really remain grounded and level-headed and you know be like be cause of inspiration to the world but has tests are there for each and every single one whether your spiritual leader or not ethical dilemmasalways be there and I'll tell you moral dilemmas are choosing between right and wrong easy ethical dilemmas a choosing between right and right or wrong wrong right and more right right right wrong and more wrong that's where the you can't really tested them you know so we all have this dilemmas and my understanding is when any leader not spiritually the political leaders corporate leadersthese principles are true for all you know everyone to the two leaders The Spiritual Leaders because the conversation is about spiritual leaders were saying address proof for every leader will power comes facility comes there is a tendency to get isolated and start living in the ivory tower you know where you are not open to learn from others are not open to connect to equals the one thing that successful leaders in any fieldmeet the most is equal friendship because in front of your superiors if you have some if you have anybody like you look up to you always good to put your face your image will like great you know and in front of people were younger to you can always photo par name is going to impress them I like everything good about me equals to friends people know you in and out this very less potential their peoplepotential both plants and people are equal then you have good relationships and friendships there is very less scope for potentials and that's where you kind of have to be open to listen to feedback from your peers and nearly equal even further which usually it is a person which usually it is here and which is precisely why the biggest danger for anybody is to have no 1who can find correct you if you feel that I am beyond anybody's correction in that is when there is a lot scope for kind of being tracked down their way down for beginners with noun for the like I strongly believe that you know the youth a lot of them will understand the true meaning of spirituality a Lil bit Into The Spiritual journey but a lot the initial you need to show them that fruit that I know this is what you'll get fromwhy should a 20 year old introducing for why should we take up something like meditation or even has agreed to get to know more about the spiritual path what's in it for them so I

is most cancers are relationship today most most used in relationships in relationships the biggest killer of a meaningful relationship is Expectations the more you expect the more your disappointed the more you are giving the more it works in your favourvery difficult to be giving to expect from a person and I am I expecting from the person because my sense of joy my sense of happiness my sense of validation comes from the other person from expecting a lot if you meditate in connecting very deeply to yourself you know and you are finding that self validation its self worth and you are not too dependent on it from somebody else you would be in a position to give more to the otherin which case you relationship get better because now you're not so much dependent Tu Ne Aisa Bolo To Mujhe Achcha lagega tune Aisa Nahin Kaha to isliye Aisa Nahin Hua lekin Aisa nahin kiya tune use Din phone nahin kiya tune message nahin kiya to start finding it within when you know that if it comes fantastic will be those days when you won't get disturb becausesomebody doesn't validated through social media as well that's a social media is that the more deeply connected you are to yourself the more you find your own value your own work you don't need anybody to give you that sense of your work is not based on likes comments and shares your work is based on who you are and the likes common sense as a want to add value to like comment and share nothing wrong with girlfriend aur boyfriend sending a beautiful messagedoesn't come I know you guys feel you know that there is a heartbreak I

lot of DM holiday Tomay Hindi Telugu trailers call aapka Love Guru and where we teach people like relationship advice but is the topic I'm not really spoken wordintense breakup was a relationship is

gayadelivered As human beings we are all going to be emotionally effective and things like that happen to us in our so firstly understand it's OK to feel that I know sometimes we try to fight it out I shouldn't feel like this and fighting that emotion of the negative emotion out there actually losing so much energy in fighting the negative emotion are even or taxable to find the actual problem which is which is not dealing with what happened to you now what's next in but no I shouldn't feel like this mujhe kuch Lena Dena nahi so I think it's OK to go through that negative emotion firstly it's alright and your head is especially I want to say this is especially to men you know just becauseman doesn't mean you're not vulnerable to negative emotion is no need to put a tough phase and I am ok alfie Sitam handling and where is internal coronavirus right now I think men put pressure on the answers to heal fast year year but I think should give yourself some time Since that time and understand the lights apart the journey you know imperfections are beautiful and perfect none of a perfect human beings and this kind of situations come to all of us in our own respective base in particular right nowrelationship between in young guys and girls so I think acceptance that this will happen if step one of the healing process go through it criterias you want to you know right away if you want to accept your negative emotions don't just keep fighting them all the time it's OK to say I am depressed even to say that I am depressed because the heartbreak needs courage actually a lot of people don'tadmit that accept admitted that step 1 the healing process and then step to is two different things can be done by step to is actually to find out someone with whom you can really confined to step one is dealing with it within yourself but step towards to have someone a friend family will someone trustworthy someone close to whom it is CO and PO routepura out an edited

everybody is different kind of bringing a different kind of coping capacities so whatever time it takes but it's important to see how to move on to the next step of life would it be another relationship would be no relationship would be what would be what you know if it'sBishop kitchen pictures based on some emotions from the first listen Proper is if it's no relationship which is based on emotions Ki Pehli Nazar vinati properties and rationale we need help in that kind of joining two three things because an all through spirituality again helps a lot all through meditation chanting with that may be kind of help to be Collateral bitgoing to accelerate healing 412 about spirituality what are the three profound spiritual experiences the you yourself have had because someone thinking about a spiritual journey Meditation by encountering se goes so you know even that an aspect of spiritual have you had any larger than life experiences in your own life to be very honestspirituality is about how it transforms my living your daily life my daily life my perspective my world views my Outlook towards relationships in Outlook towards the work Hai To how to z transform that that experience is more to me than some super Supernatural awesome occult kind of experience is not to say that you don't have them but I don't Count on them too much God for meit is a life transforming journey that some call to Supernatural experiences it's like when someone is stalking you personally and this is because I'm a podcast my job should dive deep into people's mind I just feel like you have too much perspective and I am dead show that the result of a lot of reading and sure you have spiritual learning that the monastery did show that a lot of those perspectives of constraintnot this holy book but all cashew nuts in single let's talk about holy books Have you read the bhagavad-gita yes and could break down the bhagavad-gita for the youth what is that why do people say that you open any page when you get your answer why do people say things like that sure sure I think the first thing to know let's let's remove the religion aspect of the word with the totally but it was not a religious book it is a book whichgive you the way to live and setting for the Bhagwat Geeta is the battlefield of Kurukshetra the Mahabharata where Arjun confused and Krishna becomes mentor and gives him guidance in a way that he can now start doing what is meant to write so every young man or lady is going to have confusions every young person is going to have the dilemmas at to do what not to do to benot to be exactly how the guitar begins it begins with confusion it begins with dilemmas it begins with a lack of meaning and then Krishna kind of guy is virgin through and empowers Arjun to make his own choices only acts as a facilitator and empower you need to understand that he is way to more powerful than the people is going to face in the battle is something like the lionThe Lion King Simba Simba in in company with time in and around and Pumbaa and Timon in a kind of starts identify himself be like one of them and then you have this fiki fiki that's right rafiki coming to remind him and calls for his father you know and his father comes in tell him that you are way more powerful than scarso we meet every young man in lady needs to understand that there are way more powerful than what they are going through at the moment the conclusions are smaller than them the challenges of smaller than the problems are smaller than them the heartbreak as painful as they are but still smaller than them and they have the capacity to overcome them that they going through writing that's precisely where books like the people helped a lot because thebuild knew that sense of confidence and strength and strength fortitude that I have the power as a spiritual being overcome everything is going around going on in my life and I have the power to be able to make the difference in that impact because I am spiritual being then YouTube reference like three big lessons from the Bhagavad Gita that stayed with you want to say lessons that stayed with me from theis a particular text from the second chapter of the given which talks about the summer and winter season in this particular text says that the summer and the winter season keeps coming and going every year Seasons change and just because the Seasons change we never stop performing a duties let's see for example its Chicago and the temperatures of minus 27 degree Celsiuspeople don't stop their work still let says dailydose 43 degree Celsius people still on going on with their regular the few adjustments here and there are obviously so this text of the Gita chapter two sensors that we have to learn to tolerate the ups and downs and not be distracted from what are main purposes so that something that stayed with me and not tolerate what you are going through and tolerance means livetolerating failures and pains we can understand we also have to learn to tolerate a success and the good times is both distract us you know usually only look at the negatives instructions on the positive distract us from what we are meant to be doing something that really kind of state with me the second thing that I really kind of resonate with with in the guitar is a worstfor example you want to get up early in the morning to go for a job for a work out because you know I want to keep it you know your day is a busy and you decide this is going to be my plan for the year 2020 you set the alarm clock to wake up early in the morning 5-6 whatever the alarm goes what's the mind saying the first thing you slept late last night take it easy or maybe we can do it beginning tomorrowmaybe this is not the writing for you to the minds constantly playing games right now if you have a mind which is constantly giving this kind of reasons not to wake up on the other hand if you learnt Train Your Mind using the proper intellectual process and proper spiritual process your mind can be a greatest asset in your friend which is meditation good vegetation box friends correct friends the right kind of company all of these are inputso that your mind can become the friends that the second thing that really kind of resonance with me and the third thing from the guitar that connects to me a lot is how do we start looking at the presence of divinity everywhere in every aspect we don't have to nesali go to a place of worship look at the presence of divinity you can locate the presence of divinity in nature you can get the presence of divinity and other people you can start looking at the Splendor ofPeter kreeft start looking the Splendor of the creator in the creation in which is precisely why this is something not as easy but something that I usually tell people is will look if somebody is better than you and specially if they are in the same field usually the reason security security that is this guys doing better than me in what I am doing there is any way jealousysometimes it goes to the extent of sabotaging the Other person's what happens all the time so when you start looking at divinity increation you start looking at how divinity is empowered somebody to do something in a special way that person has been gifted by higher powers and to supporters that person's work out to be envious about the person or do we feel insecureactually insulting somebody who is given that gift but if I look at that person and derive inspiration from the person I can see that inspiration to follow my aspiration in that aspect the people so kind of really resonates with me that you start looking at divinity everywhere a and an every place around you including people were doing better because it's not them you can see straight awaywhere are you after I see people who is remarkable staff and they usually when the speak this if they doing it and coaster doing it no doubt the part of part the doing that you can tell that there was something beyond them that stand making them do it whether it's acting speaking singing thing with an element which is not necessarily effort not their effort in X Factor expect when you start appreciating the expected his divinitythat's something that really can't connect to me is my favourite verses from the Bible is Philippians 4 13 it got a tattoo Philippines 4:30 and the versus I can do all things through him to give me strength so it's the candidates that same idea that any kind of creative process is not entirely or slow you are just the channel so the second thing I ask you is now I am getting coached through the session that this potters everybodycoaching sessions with this one especially mutualism in like I don't thank you because the divinity talk and to me but a so when I know you go to a lot of top business leaders talk a lot of top corporate leaders you know when someone read that probably become Alfaaz of their field and they become kings of their field volcano coaching they need something right to get the other than the whole thing about success going to the head and saying humble todayI think what happens once you reach there you realise that now you simply there in the number game now you are in the first ten correct the question is if you won how to maintain that one if you are not one how to be the one on the first time you want to be the first if you were the first to maintain the so most people relynot wordsolver the more you go up there is a best be something much larger in my life then this will lose the people who reached the heights of success are looking for meaning and purpose and ability to create impact this court that that that the proposed by the ability to create an impact through what they are doing whether through coaching people whether it is through opening nonprofits whether it's whatever whatever aspect but really kind ofgo out the make different so I do see that that strong kind of respiration people reached that really want meaning now to our lives and then that's why they kind of Look At coaching and I also think that they have a personal life relationships personal life I must tell you something when you really wanted to be updated after it comes at a massive costArun personal life relationships so much has to be put into the background to be able to really get up there which is not what I really recommend but people do that and then there's a lot of backlash that comes from the lord of unhealed areas of their lives personal and relationship which is better than they need a lot of work but what in them is making them strive that hard for that numberyeah think it's kind of intoxicating Ranveer Nasha Nasha Hai Ji numbers Ek Nasha Hai social media per numbers kya hai ek Nasha Hai Bus itne videos Dekhkar kitne video views mein se kitne pura Dekha Hai YouTube par koi video dekh raha hai usmein kharcha 15 Million views Hai usmein Kitne actually pura video dekha hai aurKitna news video ka Kuchh content Lekar Kuchh Jindagi Mein Kiya Hai number whether its social media with its money for their followers number following physically number of followers like leaders having the following people there it's fair in toxicating so once you jatiyana Upar premier you drink alcohol it comes down in a couple ofbut Intex occasion of numbers in the sky above achievements is very hard to kind of come down from it so it's not a people don't know a part of them is telling them this is not the right way to live but it just so easy to this bar skin to that space in I am the King number 1 you know but then when I see some of the super successful jointsprivate space very genuine people dream region when people some of them are not necessary or not those were not executed in the private space is the most amazing human beings but out there are there in the game like I think our spouses like really groundyou know great support for someone is out there like that the greatest asset for people like the greatest asset that when you don't necessarily like life coaching coaching kind of thing is if someone was being there with you through that journey you know and kept you grounded and level-headed in kind of Android all anchored your life in giving you that space to open up confide be yourself I'll tell you what the higher up you gousually not since all the time usually just had to put a face most time you're not yourself as a public figure it out better mask to wear mask most public figures are not who they are there in public and rightly so wrongly so I know it's their lives in at the same time you now you can do what you need to do but there has to be a space where you just u u u no no masks at all no Patelinstall my Guru Radha Soami author of the book The Journey home beautiful and when I joined the monastery Ashram me one thing I told me as he said you have this element to do something you should do it and he said to me you should be a lion at chase and a lamp at home when you are out there should be a lion HS conquer frontiers recharge share the message go out there you knowdon't compromise on your ambition to grow and reception to grow is not for myself but to spread the message what about growth if you don't have a mission to grow and reach out enough to get that happened but the same time be a lamp at home when you come back with a beer with your friends speak yourself this is no pretension was no mask no nothing I think you have someone like that very successful has a partner life partnerprivilege and strength to Fir on a strongly believe that everyone is born with their own strengths and weaknesses in life but my question to you is that does everyone have that capability within themselves to become if not a billionaire at least a multi-million and life can everyone achieve that if they kind of put them in the right place the body in the right place that friends in the right place glasssome water bottle 500ml capacity summer like elitism of one and half litre each one has the capacity and each one can be filled up to the brim if a 500ml bottle tries to fill itself with a litre of water is not possible because a capacity is 500 to each one has a certain to passiveand self-discovery is about trying to figure out what your capacity and to function to the optimum of your capacity 500ml water bottle and which only filled up to 200 ml you're not using it is optimum space capacity so how can I bring it to 500 is the question to yes I may not have that capacity to probably be a billionaire PrimeCity to be a billionaire not playing my best I'm not giving my best some still not even close to be any anywhere close to being a unit I don't think it's about not being a millionaire I think it's about really functioning to the optimum of our own capacity which is precisely why reflection introspection is important because it helps us understand our own self and icethat we we do things without understanding of self we don't understand what are capacities are we don't understand what our passion is been understand what our abilities are you just cannot keep doing things so where are we heading then once you identify it you know this is what I need to work on to grow and grow how much to as much as my capacities and how do you know I have reached my capacity this islimit beyond that you know you cannot keep trying for 25 years do you know this is how much this is kind of the sealing element that something I am in some people have it some people don't very few people have it from the late great Kobe Bryant at se Dhoni very long back where I think when I was starting out you too had always put caps on myself it was only want to build to 2000Civil Court market from fitness products then it became hundred thousands of cabinet in my favourite youtuber Hai Dhoni Hundred Thousand Light on the cross that I kept putting limit on myself now I genuinely feel YouTube is a great teacher in life and not done MBA travel and more as much as MB in terms of knowledge and wisdom because I've been running this community myself Duniya lot of life lessons and the one thing that resonated with me a lot about Kobe Bryant said about don't put ceiling on yourselfI think your subscribers ceiling you don't have any impact ceiling on yourself it's really was most important you know that's really was most important is that you don't put a cap on your the capacity to impact people you know when should one sees know that this is how much I can do that numbers follows a consequence you know when your purpose is to make an impact that numbers follows a consequence and at a point of time you realise that I am I am constantly onworking on my journey of impact the numbers stop coming at a certain point of time it's not going to be it's not going to be like a newly growing in the things will it be on the track does not that we will be at a certain point of time what I'm trying to say is when we talkcapping limits we are talking about knowing what are capacity is you know what when you push yourself beyond your capacity you know that you're doing it at the cost of other thing with a matter that matter to you when you when you are functioning within your optimum capacity you doing at with proper attention to what needs attention people getting consumed by the thing that I want to add any cost be there I won't sleepI don't care Ed am really doesn't matter to me what matters to 20 numbers and money as soon as that's what you consumed by when you realise the that's not how it functions so when you know that I have grown into x now and now I want to grow 2 X + 1 redirect or select 100x I want to go from X200 xx200x is my capacitythen it will come in a certain way that I don't have to compromise and other aspects of my life if 800 x is not my capacity than I know that I am going to have to compromise on so many other aspects of my life because it's not within the bandwidth that I have not mean that kind of persons of these things and learning slowly with time on it and this interview that one Outta My Headhave liked to final questions you are the first question is that if you have the ability to give five books to every single human being in the world which five books would it be the second question later the first book of course I would give the great book is something that you know people in the way of living the second book I would give his journey home which is my the journey of my Guru Radha Swami Road Guru Swamy Road that bookis drawn into Indiana life lessons a beautiful read Third book that I would give is why leaders eat last by Simon sinek it's incredible read on leadership the fourth book that I would give is positive personality profile types by Robert from which helps to analyse your personality bygreat detail and helps you work on yourself to come up to optimum capacity that we were discussing the Mahabharata again when I talk about the guitar and the Mahabharat spoke about three other Books with the MahabharataKuchh Bhi on black and white book goes beyond right or wrong with his life about this ethical dilemmas so it's so close to real life when you read that book is not like these lenses Portrait of a given to which like starting to you can start connect your own journey and slowly figures and said that this would be the last question is you have an idea of what we do in the spacethank you got to know me LLB 3

Ranveer show the most gorgeous guess that we had on the show Priyanka Chopra what can be said about this beautiful woman in the beautiful mind that not already been said to the time I had thought through this podcast we really boatrider dig deep to find out what keeps her up clock ticking what keeps her mentality and ambition going we would work but her mental health issues the experiences in the early part of a house built himself up to this point and even her plans for the future of Trust me on the mostwiring conversation ever had on a personal level Kisi someone is inspired me alot but I've also had the biggest crush on her growing up so without further ADO I hope you enjoy one of the most memorable moments of my life enjoy ourselves so this Queens the you come across in your life and dislike Mega hyper supergreens Priyanka Chopra thank you so muchhaving me so before asking you any questions crisis tell you to thoughts of you that I've got my course fees in the first is that Vinod Bollywood celebrities usually the nation always mixed opinions on them that you are some people who live in some people don't like you but Priyanka Chopra irrespective of a gender caste all the everyone loves you like festival very very kind and second wall I don't think that's true that storenonexistent but I'm sure someone who generally is super magnetic and that's why the nation is back to the second everyone tell you that the first time I will realise that a guy can like a girl and realise this concept of crashes exists you are my first person live after is Andaaz Andaaz is really much like me you coming on the second halfacuminous printable story was done before the c***** the show is the first question I have to do is what is the secret of this magnetism because it's not inbuilt something you worked on overtime hours Unborn visit I would say I think is called confidence ok I feel like confidence is something you can teach yourself confidence and you know your story is a little bit like that you talk to yourself and you told yourself what you wanted to be and you want toyou want to keep it from thank you where that I mean I learnt it from my mother I learnt it from the very very strong people in my family that I looked up to that showed me that it doesn't matter what your circumstances that matter how large your dreams and I have really large dreams about you even now I'm pretty sure as a basis of you when you started my ambition give me purpose and I think purpose is very important in life you have to have a sonwhatever that might be to be your children it could be your family it will be your career it could be anything but I as a human being I feel like my purpose is my purpose is the pursuit of excellence in anything that I do I don't like doing anything less than perfect when you doing what you want people to remember us I want them to say that I left behind a Legacy I want my kids to feel like you know proud to say that that I wantsay that I am a Dent in my heart in entertainment in my profession that I am a public person directly through every facet of my life whether it was my acting my profile my producing my philanthropy just being a girl can I tell you something right now Indians when they looking Priyanka Chopra every single Indians like the struggle that alreadyI am from a very small town I was raised in Bareilly I was born in Jamshedpur my dad from Punjab I think that if I can have aspirations and be sitting on the stabbing interview by you hear the words that you are saying it can happen to anyone as long as you you have the perseverance to go that far am I next question 2 is a when you begin in Bollywood and show your head like a version of it before you started and then it must change something new to what were those thingsSanju like be like this when I first I was 17 and I won't miss India and miss world I just under 3000 getting movie offers so that time it was very like having actors about wearing nice clothes and I getting behind makeup done and like saying you lines in like dancing in UAE visit trivial in my head which is no one for my entire family everyone went to Bombay forget like Bin entertainment my dad was a musicianjoin us in on stage it was never in the business of entertainment and I started working like in and as for example there was a moment we know that song the one in with Akshay me whenever in South Africa song no do you are the one the romantic short andand once the 40 something take happened and I didn't get it right I remember Raju Khan is the choreographer that time use Roji Sun it was Mike Dunn is just because you miss world you think you can become an actress goal on how to dance and then come back and perform and luckily Akshay wife went into labour at that point to CSS casual when it was cut short and we came back to India just for a break and I remember going to Pandit Nehru questions classconcerning Kathak at about 6 hours every single day and then when I went back for the next schedule and you so much more and that day I realise that there is there something about knowledge that something about if you learn enough you don't know something if you have an ambition to be somewhere if you prepare yourself you have the ability to be better than everyone else you could decide the level of at every stage I like to be prepared for everything even if it's an interview even if I am goingRed Carpet even if something is trivial to someone will be stepping up in becoming a Bollywood producer gas I like to learn which is why as becoming a Hindi movie producer am I the reason I decided to do produce sky is Pink with was because the producers are Sid Roy Kapur and Ronnie screwvala as producers I admire them tremendously they had about six films with them buffy fashion films and define my career so I knew I could learn again from them so I am new as a producer some workingwho can learn from nervous about this release is special for me to be nervous whatever the Destiny of this film is I know it doesn't have the the comedy in laughter and the big set number in the song pieces I know it's not that but at the same time there is something that has come really from the deep pinnacles of my heart because it's based on a real life couple not some medal winning at Leela Ke play the last time or not some superstar is based on real people withNari circumstances and that's something that is special real kind of trajectory of a relationship so have you what we learn from your relationship in a letter not just song romantic all kinds what that I hate u honesty is important in relationships with friends whether it with family whether it with your loved one whether it's in a romantic relationship I think being real to what you really are feeling is very importanta lot of people don't have the guts to do that because we always pretending to be a certain way so that we can maintain relationship in the healthiest relationship happen when you have the ability to call out someone and say that's not right or I don't feel certain way and you are wrong you are right and to be able to talk about it it takes taking that clock of being careful about your emotions of that are important to have seen a lot more interviews in my life and I didn't see who inspired youparents and students perform their relationship was able to learn from them their relationship to the relationship of equals from the very beginning of my parents even though they have separate responsibilities and they always work together but they always gave Each Other respect in terms of each other's opinions and I was raised and environment like that my mums open in as important as my dad's opinion they both to the Seasons together it was never one person's monopolyAnderson extremely healthy marriage that job at home as well as a part of growing up and would you say the discipline is also the reason that you become Priyanka Chopra that the Priyanka Chopra's discipline with Barbie all IPS I think people are confused discipline with like punctuality sometimes that now discipline is discipline is being prepared discipline is Riaz discipline is training disciplineI'm learning discipline is knowing that if I'm going to do a job I am going to give it 120% otherwise I'm not gonna do it because when it comes to the military even one mistake can cause a big big butterfly effect and that something and definitely learn from both my parents as physicians and as people who are in the military and again from the lord and when you the middle of your Hustle you don't come to know how good you are and union outside perspective so trust me from the outside againsomeone who constantly moved on to the next project even after victories is something you do consciously that if a firm is it really cool Guda 20 and about it and move on to the next one I mean I really feel like you are defined by every time you are defined by the way you do next not you left Behind when you have superhit film what's going on in your head that happens next stop that or what if I can do that can be different my not be the same thing there is no pointSamsung Opera gana try not to do the same thing over again you have to take risks risks are so important in evolution playing it safe you can have an existence but you'll never be someone who is a trailblazer and legendary shit I like legendary we can you don't forget that that's a lot for your carry-on that's been an anchor point for every smile through everything my dad was extremely sensitivehe was also like my biggest champion the one thing that I learn with from him was the Hustle he always taught me that don't be afraid of the failure what you do next after Failure is what is define you everyone feels it can happen to you is having means that happen to everyone instead of sitting on your hands in thing I can't do it again find the courage inside of using what can I do differently are you look back and you're mistaken seat that was a mistake great not doing that againthat's something I didn't my dad and the whole thing about using magnetic this is a part of it that you smile through every thing I really want to know who is am in feet with generally with the Indian youth does use mental health issues that are going around because of social media and things like that so approve your Kariyo you had any mental health issues for you just ahead in by like you know smiling through it I think so I think it one of us has I don't know if because I never went to a therapist I kind ofmyself to you didn't even know I have tried it I tried a couple of times their faces in my life especially after my dad I didn't know how to deal with my emotions I was a new country I didn't know people I was walking into meetings were people that know me as Re introducing myself at the age of 31 32 after I had conquered and other industry in India so you know all of those things added a lot of pressures on me in a new starting all over again another country where culture is differentso it took a big toll on me at that point and I don't know if I can clinically se I was depressed or not but I really felt like I was I am I tried to go to their Facebook because I didn't have the consistency of the him I will I didn't follow through so I kinda logi fight with myself I am someone to talk to myself and I think about Singh is whether it's in my dreams of whether it's when I'm awake at talk to myself about how I am feeling and how I can overcome what did you tell yourself that got you order your difficult timeI told myself to allow myself to feel it to accepted I think you have to reach a place of acceptance of the fact that it's OK to feel that way instead of beating yourself up about it will also give your mind busy with work for while I did and that was not the best decision it was me running away from my issues where as I realise that especially when you have something that you mentally feeling like you can't move on from you have towhat you have to find someone you can rely on I realise a lot of my friends at that point I relied on I chose instead of being alone and dealing with it alone I would go out seek out people that actually care about me and I think a lot of kids don't do that we because of stuff we reading people opinions that we read on online and trust me no one has more opinions about people I mean about someone as they do about me I get so many opinions from people goodAgali and I could very easily se kam under the pressure of it but I feel like social media can be good and can be Evil if you focus on The Good the idea of social media was to get people together it was never to make people feel like they are their targets exactly so I think instead of focusing on the negativity and taking the pressure of its important if you're feeling down the deep to not keep it to yourself do not be alone it's very important to find someone that you canteven if we can help you doesn't have to be their physical Biya mummy ko be your friend it could be someone pattandur alone but that you because it support from find support because a lot of kids and applied taking their lives and the in I'm getting into deep dark places because they think they have to solve it themselves you don't have to know the sky is pink as a movie from the trailer you can tell the best this whole concept of the mother helping a daughter and I'm sure that the main characters have a mental health issues through the filmwhat do you picked up from this will be a part of the beauty of this film was that the takeover of this movie which thing when ever when you guys go on what should you realise that the it's the philosophy of the movie what she means by the sky is pink is don't let anyone tell you what the colour of your Sky should be when it was which is the correct I play was her daughter was diagnosed with a terminal illness she was in London getting her daughter treated alone while husband taking care of her son who was 4 years old in Delhi andHassan call rap why she was in London and was crying and stammering and said that you know maugham the teacher really al-amin because I in painting class Assamese and the corner because and painting classes in the sky pink and she said the sky is blue but if the sky can be is the sky blue so the mother got so affected by then she said oh never let anyone define to you what you ask I should be so the metaphor of live your life on your terms don't let anyone expectationab you define what you want to do it's not their life it's yours so I found that so beautiful about the movie that it's about it doesn't matter your life is long or not it matter if it's big and this movie is about that so you know Priyanka Chopra's inquiring about Priyanka Chopra's mum is equal to how much will be put into this movie my mum is very philosophy protective about me it is very important to her that every dream that I had with a small weather is being myoperations were fulfilled my parents never wanted me to have a what is in my life whatever I had done it what if I had tried that they always supported me the same no matter what you do whatever mistake you may have the confidence comment Ellis that is like you never kill someone my dad remember him telling me this even if you kill someone coming tell me and help you find the body will help you a very the body but then I'll take you the cost so you will always have to have courage of conviction which is something my parentsBig support systems in your life today everything is perfect for you I just feel like I don't because I am a public person is very easy for my my entire life to be open book but I like to keep few things to myself I feel like I wanna be like a duck you know paddling Furious furiously under the water looking but looking really lucky and come outside andI feel like Grace under fire is what I believe I want to be having dignity and grace is really important to me everyone has struggles I don't like to be a victim I'll find my own solutions that might be good for me bad for me but they'll be mine what message you are young girl watching this or relating to this podcast was the one thing I would definitely say is there is no do or die in this world nothing is important enough for you take so much pressure that it defines your life you are to be like waterlearn to be like water table adaptable fit into any vessel have a sense of calm have a sense of patients but ambition is extremely important and I don't know say sister girls Ice Age 2 boys and girls just everyone who wants to be able to have a purpose in life have an ambition have the guts to find your glory is extremely important to have got to have conviction to be able to say that you know this is what I want and I want to achieve it and the challenge yourself yes I find challenging myself extremely fullI do my best work when I feel nervous I do my best work under pressure but that doesn't work for everyone some people like to work in a sense of calm I like to work in a sense of chaos to inspire the whole country of the day and I am dead short tenure Sanaya Irani won the biggest production houses other countries in because every sales people have always Challenge 2 Dev doubted you

one key question this is coming from my Instagram comment section to Abhi youth movement chal rahi hai Jiska Naam Hai nofap which basically is brahmacharyam it's not letting go of your creative energy

Ayurveda start nourishing your brain cells in such a way that you build no dietary American do it and plus you also build uncommon intelligence in photographic memory so what I feel if brahmcharya is needed until the age of 25 for sure25 sal ki Umra Tak Brahmachari Ka practis Karna bahut jaruri hai Kyunki vahan Mein Ko Bataun greatness you can never build while running behind women and and satisfy your genitals cookies Ka Raja little ke satisfaction ki judai roscoe control kar liya Na To fir Mere Khyal hai aapko bahut chij hai vaise bhi district nahin kar sakte need to focus on EBS option Nahin Sakta ke goal statement Mein absorption chahie vah chij haiMeri Khele Mein because of the spiritual practices and staying in Gurukul actually helped me a lot is 25 and there is where you are responsible to create a new child so then we Innova Brahmachari you can still practice brahmacharya even interested Life by regulating their sexual Life OKcan you explain the need for the like this Why Not Me Kamna hai usko Dharm ke aap Chhatri Ke Niche practice kiya jaaye kya hua keeping the relationship with the family life that one and plus not seeing your wife as a commodity to satisfy your genitals so basically you are purpose of having relationship with her it to actually serve the society and family and the lord not just to actuallyfor your desired touch of your genitals don't see her is an object of my senses The Horizon Ko contributor In The ecosystem if you are letting go of your semen during married life does it take away from your mental sharpness regulation is required but what would counter regulationbecause the purpose of life will bring regulations desire to regulate will not bring regulation if you see if I ask you a question on bye-bye Ek na Ek Gulabi Rang ka Hathi

as other than films at present you with this man is everything from fitness to vegetarian vs non veg dynamism to Lifestyle choices to Ayurved to Fashion obviously we also spoke about his own Bollywood Johnny house hi cracked house he built his own career of mental fitness andcos deep conversations on spirituality if you only one was one part of the podcast watch that part I present you Ayushmann Khurrana on the Ranveer show extremely and writing extremely intelligent enjoy yourself what did you guys didn't of what style of what career is a great talk about what it's like having a flourishing career inwe got AyushmanSP office to like that smile and be like you learn to grow this part of that night but my first question 2 ka 2 and guided me everything for everything ki kahani audition dene Kisko mila hai to job because ofplease Sofia kid growing up in the 2000 my first encounter with Ayushman was when used to host this show it was called WhatsApp for some yesrepresent the camera and but my eventual goal was to be an actor in the movie Rocky remember now he always envisions a champion so was that invasion thing that you like you won't be at the topMumbai you should be well prepared was very well prepared I will be theatres in style of music since childhood and and now the right place at the right time to take vitamin that move right left right time ok right time I'll talk about timings from life is about timing batting karte hue timing regular Kuchh Nahin Lagta Chor connector and I'm glad I am born in this Era agar mein 10 sal pahle Paida Hota only 2000 Mein struggle kar raha Hota Tomujhe mauka de na Milta Vikas industry lost control group and everyone is the bestBollywood star I prepared myself to be active to begin with and star is incidental you know if your films are working eventually become a stock but the actors but when you do your first film lagti don't care what was your head like what do you want to do with your career as a good part in the film and get ready to recognise a good actor that was it nothing more than that and you know magic also happens when you don't expect much be my first Vicky Donorcritical acclaim Milega abhi lekin small film but became such a Mammoth of a s i never expected that but all well it's it was kind of Plateau breaking film my first film Mr case study with me kam paison Mein film Banai and the body hit movie superhit movie blockbuster Rohit and it set the ball rolling you are so you know you were already famous before that can be used to get recognised restaurants on the road but after Bollywood happened what happened in the frame it was veryare you know because I should take interviews now I give interviews Singh Bollywood from the other side helped me a lot give me your great perception towards the industry To Kabhi Kabhi Aas baaki galti se sakte ho to aap interview questions poochh rahe ho I was used to ask question answering questions and nowcan be something that cannot be the standard romantic hero type thing which we use the conventional Bollywood actors we are always doing something that the layout to your whole brand image for now and it's some kind of impact especially I feel personal email related impact of a lot of guys when guys what you feel this is themselves disease in securities imperfections of beautiful is it that we see in perfect man ruling the celluloid over the years the IDto get that I'm perfect common man that person on a pedestal and celebrate those infections with nobody is perfect in reality to usko Aam Aadmi ko confidence Milta Sharif filmen Vahi Ek Fark Hai and it's very important to have the space for yourself why so my next question is I personally feel like that you are someone to strategize with your career as a new do kind of this formula of the Caribbean impact this is oklook at me is that true like do you think about that I want to be thinking about the brand Ayushmann Khurrana as well as the part what I think she's never ki team sochti hi I am just taking care of the craft and handled by Yash Raj and they are very credible they are very nice people that take care of me I love the Chopra that loves me so it's like a happy happy marriage were there and apart from that I can only take care of my craft ideas to make the right choices in a film with a credible script switchread I am glad I am gifted like that Mujhe prescriptions Hai Ab Main Usko boost nahin kar sakta Kyunki jo abhi Railway ke 5 Sal bad sign Na Ho To Asal mein kisi ko pata nahin Hota kya chalne wala hai ki mummy ko kya pasand Aane Wale background theatre Desh Ke Kone Kone Mein Ja chuka hun when I was in my teens with my theatre group and interactive a lot of people also through radiouska Mujhe fayda the script Tumne Mein and almost all the states to mujhe Har Koi Bhasha Thodi Thodi Aati Haiyou have to be to get the situation and the right choice God Was best for your future we are but my question to you is every night like the brother of Ayushmann Khurrana just the regular that were taking a night before going to sleep and watch your first thought in the morning I don't think much I just want to have 8 hours of sleep yeah that I can we charge a battery is in be more creative do you think about your career at night I don't is it that the film is leaving negative probably as Sleepless Nightboard exam results next day that's about it otherwise I'd sleep listen to music read a book and sleep and for the morning I am very grog in the morning Aadha Ghanta mujhe koi baat na Karen I am like that but when you have brain becomes active than you think of it as for the day my mind switches from one thing to the other is very hard to keep that focus so you know my manager always complains you areMujhe Badi Se Badi chij baat nahin karti Chhoti Si chij bahut karne Jaati Hai use everythingok my bro when you are hosting says something like India's Got Talent host a lot of people in the media industry even though he was usually put you into moulds near host a job and Akshay Kumar this thing that you need to constantly break your moulds India to sustain a long-term so that show and used to see other young guys making the debuts did you feel any four more XP of missing out with what was your man today we're just focus on your game will host the first timewhat was the total game changer moment for me I always thought the wages got opportunities in films and Idea was to get the best opportunity to the magnet had actually said no to 6 years before Vicky Donor as a lead because it's in the street from the outside scene actress committing mistakes with the wrong choices of projects 200 people making life style mistakes I have cause but the thing is my dad statusShubh Bachpan se bahut hi dance ke Rakha Hua Hai Bhandari ke Rakha hua hai vah mere sath mein bhai ke sath we don't drink and smoke and we both Sharif acche bacche Hain Jab Rose ho I want to reference one Instagram post you are made with this photo is very natural sexy you don't wasn't like steroid sexy which is what you've come to expect a lot from the media industry ki definitely Pajama like this really naturalachievable physique eventesia my girlfriend is the time she sent me a look at this guy and caption was something very interesting you said that yaar is the antibody can build without any viruses in your life without alcohol without smoking without the elements but it's not for everyone was heavier during andhadhun badhai ho I sweat a lot of protein supplements but later I realised that they not good for health or even Protein Shakes are really bad elaborate it takes three years to digeststationary body anything which is processed which is manufactured this advertisement is not right for you should this mark that ok you keypad all natural right all natural lesson gluten less lactose and even you can't trust poultry in India but I want awkward non veg stew option as well as a vegetarian no I am not have a non vegetarian but it's better to be vegetarian if you have likeslow metabolism and but the problem is I lose weight and lose muscle quite easily so I have to take eggs and fish and some non veg to stay away from poultry and you say we can be termed Idli I would stay away from poultry but I have to take action all because I have to be the next well but for dream girl and Bala I'd lost weight I was almost a vegetarian unlike Abhinandan badhai ho gaya isliye body no body type and thendiet and obviously when to fever Maya and that in Austria so I got to know that about intolerances you need to know kaun se food products of allergic Hai if that started there were no bloating your body you have natural six packs so bro what your diet like today of normal diet is nothing unusual as it is all natural I start my day with sesame seeds and nutseggs gluten free bread that breakfast and I take water 30 minutes after my meals and also I can you water 30 minutes prior to my means no water in between and idli it is good to have focus on one food items like if you're having like fish and rise the sufficient rise don't with paneer the land under the things it's is equal to focus on one thing also if you're having this rice and chicken for examplemix it with Roti roti and rice it's easy for the body to digest would confuse your body is called as you should I just a simple basic things to take care of their common health maintenance Luke coutinho of course there is always so inspiring and and what about your exercise regimenfunction of weight training sports what do you think I do list of cardio and weights depends on the character and playing on screen so I have to build muscle at public auction on weight training if not then this cardio for dream will I was doing only card you because I was not looking good in a lehenga with the value of tests were Mera Tu Mera lehenga Mein muscles and other input should look like let it go in the film that I lost weight or weight loss Kiya receding hairlinelook like a 20 year old to find lost move 861 during Bala so yeah that was my lowest I want to talk about Balapur more specifically I want to talk about this character yaar like I am seeing a lot of guys my age of 1993 born already seeing guys who are dealing with a lot of male pattern baldness a lot of issues in this function that anything happening link people member 20 is now it's definitely partly geneticto balding lot of it is like Lifestyle choices absolutely it's about just about your life size wise and holding pattern and place with grey jeans my grandfather had lesson my father is less likely is almost 70 and got full grown here so I am blessed like that would otherwise it should you take care of your hair don't Pull off a dog that I do I don't put lot of Laughter Mein Hi I choose to keep my head naturallyfilming eventually Ja Tu Jyada Janam kar dunga lekin jo aap film Dekhte Ho usmein Itna jaldi Nahin Ho at a stretch you are definitelyevery great ok I'm All Yours hot I guess a lot of the guys actually did male pattern baldness and where is genetic in the Lifestyle store in check and it all starts from water like have don't and water in plastic useBottles And mental stress definitely I think bol balding also Eid is all about stress and other film this function Shubh Mangal Jyada Savdhan Sumit these doctors and quick bandar ke bolata nahin hai aapko bhi theek karogirls like you for the charm with Ayushman jumper guys like you because guys can't discuss these issues with my friends just I think I should I talk about my balding my heart is it ok to have that our guys are drawn to koi ladka ladki ki choices bilkul alag alag Ho Jaati Hai12 for example we have Bhumi in the film near me in the film Bhumi is somebody who's who got dark skin the film and she still not Complex Trichy lekin Alpha woman I am the one being a guy who's really really Complex with with my receding hairline in the film so I get inspired from booming in the film this character of this woman is so strong and arrow with every film of time I will always support progressive filmsthey have to be progressively we have to be gender fluid or mother of the fork honi chahie Hamare Desh Mein Do alag Tarah Ke Desh Hai Bharat Hindustan aur India aur usmein jab jab Chhote Shahar Se Kabhi log Aate Hain Bade Shahar Mein Hua judgement pass Karte Hain Ki ladkiyon ke pass Karen ladkon ke pass Karen ki Apni Apni thought process Hota Kyon bahut bahut hota hai Hamen do India ko mana Milana Hai 70% of a country is primary sector yah matlab hamkya ho raha hai cal article 15 cast is involved Ram Ram paint hai so I guess we have just come in these two thought processes which which are there in the country people of purpose in your work bro like I feel that a lot of factors may be some people just focus on their own career growth your time to do something to offer you can put on messages screen theatres vahan per we normally combine entertainwith social messages traditionally Street theatre used to be message driven and the dolan Boring read dark rising College Ke Log dekhne Nahin Aate Hain aap Jab aap Bulane Jaate Hain sadkon Ke Logon Ko Kisi market Mein Jaate Hain To entertaining banana Shuru kar diya entertainment and you have to do that message to set for entertainment 282different but Bala is again a tragicomedy like where you will it will touch your funny bone also it will deliver message also and its for me is a perfect script bro when you do every form of an actor you learn something from nothing to something stays with you so because you play the guy who is dealing with this issue in this film what is your message to the guys were dealing with issues between PC to Bala trailer there have been comment under the trail of Happy birthday yaar but the guys are going to this only they understand their own pain what a message toit's MP3 eventually when you see the film or when I was working on the script I didn't realise how tough the situation is when I saw myself in the mirror has a ok this is different and I'm not looking as attractive maybe but again when I was it to the shoot for next 10 days I got used to it I became more confident and I know two kinds of guys one a very complex because of the receding hairline to don't give two hootsFark nahi padta ki Mere Bal Jhad rahe hain bhi personality acchi hai mera Baki talent bhi hai mujhe bilkul Fark nahi padta do just that shift subala is also have that during the film from Complex character to somebody who's really really positive and it celebrates self-love eventually so that the filmBruce oh my next question is because you doing so much purpose-driven work during that were the universe is giving you success and I know this number you what about my listened to a quiet voice 58 ups and downs in my lifeand I started falling within Buddhism edible or so that changed my perspective about life so you read it I meditate at Chant and I've came rising master now now during your life was a great practice I guess you could introduce bye-bye bye-bye my wife and she battled cancer because of that she got the strength and because of this in tourism andI think my entire career when it true that to that that shift because of this I remember when I joined to the first time I was like oh my God I felt like there was a superpower inside me and I can this conquer the world and it was so beautiful and magical during the Chand is it too long can you live mention I can you know this one chance to live a long and then this gongyo and then this is the meaning of used to transferlet me just give the listeners some perspective on this so basically the yogic and Buddhist chants and decide that the word have a certain frequency which creates changes inside your body and because creating changes inside your body in a girl get positive realised that without oven and yeast analyse all the positivity around you and at the same time it's all about cause and effect you create causes whatever your future is going to be you have to work towards it it reaction driven practice is not passively mostmeditation spiritual practices Pacific tell you what contentment this is not about containment is about living your life and also achieving your dreams and eventually is not is not selfish practice is self respect to the same time those who believe Chand kar do na Puri community ke liye pure India ke liye pure Desh Ke Liye chat kar do also that beyond India I am I getting aI am I am patriotic show at the same time I think of human level per connect with you bro this thing called the power of manifestation and all the US and I can you elaborate on how you view the power manifestation into the first time tab Mujhe aadami audition dene jata tha aur apne Man Mein Socha Tha ki Jab Tak Mera Koi edition crack Nahin Hoga main mein kisi bikini likhunga main Juhu Beach cross Karta Tha Mumbaiit sits right into the ocean in the Deccan auto Se Chupke and it was the power so strong Ek Hafte Tak Maine Dekha hi Nahin Bij Ko Kisi Ke Ghar jata tha business Rana Dikhta Hai Guitar and when I got my first contract my hand as a radio presenter then I went to Juhu Beach open my arms and I have arrived have conquered bizworld serum you Manifesto energy and you just think about a particular thing and she would findand Aisa Nahin Socha to sochte Raho Kuchh karna padta uske liye Kiya Haiyour soul is young and nothing stop you from achieving like anything in this world and I think the same I will be the younger version of myself over 40 years but for your career what is the best from Waste and right now I know you take one day at a temperature of spiritual person that would be taught to do at the same time what is the best kiss ever would you like to see yourself at the age of 50 are the age of 60 that I am not saying career do you want man like what do you want you want to get up in a big house do you want I am not a meeting dual is a person okmy entire focuses on this happiness for internal happiness your inner peace and it has to be a correct balance between contentment and ambition it cannot be hyper ambitious and cannot be over contended you have to trade that middle parts and you'll always oscillate but it has to be a mix of both did you make a mistake that you have permissions of course I was overly ambitious I was suffering person in my life andtalking my parents nobody of such as when I was in T20 Mumbai mein naya naya aaya tha radio show Karta Tha Agrawal Ek TV serial Karta Tha Aur MTV Karta Tha aur message

Jita tha Sal bad ki koi aur ji diya tha agale Sal Se Mujhe bhul gaye the normally is confuse them with success frame is just a byproduct of success if you are famous for successful you will get Fame but if you get famousthat's very dangerous reality shows and social media know exactly so I want to ask you about social media and digital also do modern like film actors look at social media as a part of very important part of the Carriers or is it like that it really depends to each his own like I thrive on social media because I was I was the Vijay and on the other hand something like Ranbir he is not on social media rahi thi things that this has to be some kind ofmystery around star which is also right but somebody who is very relatable who thrives on connect with the masses I cannot do without water media what's your social media 11 for someone to make it big on social media for young Bollywood what do you done is this a month of all of films this creative space be different from others that is as simple as that are being different even ask you what is a style that is worth a lot of Punjabi munda as itevolution and will not I will not showing up pictures like 10 days 10 years

trouble I personally look at Shahrukh Khan assignment not and that's what you're doing and made in Chinaalso heard you saying in interviews that yaar acting is kind of like entrepreneurship at the beginning when I just starting out like as on the start of guys you translate ideas to try and sell your product supply casino we go to different audition with cancel ourselves we try and sell the best version of ourselves we transfer your talent in USA that somebody out there can invest in US with the same thing in a way to the same thing in your selling something which is of your own and as a entrepreneur selling a different productoddity I want to take you to the actual struggling baby audition audition time view not dark I really enjoy it was so happy with city in water after I came here on 17 February 2008 on my bike which are used to drive like riding on your bike review drove from Gurgaon from Pune so I got my bike in train from Delhi to Pune from Pune to Bombay I came here on my bike is to travel to write that by 4 yearsthat you are used at bike abhi kaun si gaadi and living your dream that you know that I have to I made sure that I meanone person everyday if not I can't believe that at home in Mumbai in Mumbai and to work ok I and help you actually know career cause I I came here for the showreel I made this lack of 5 minutes we were up and put everything of mine from it it is my dance by Marshall Aisa Batani hai kya bataya Sab acting portion my short films please my portfolio is really weird portfolios now when I look back but I was trying to show that showed it to everyone where I can but luckily they were casting directors by thenplease you have someone to recharge to someone to meet the strive to meet our people trying to show the My Show real but we'd have two years like they would they would like it they would call me for the audition but they would say you know this really one scene part 2 that or maybe just a very passing short which I did also like I I don't add there were some 50 people and I was one of them my but the first audition that I gave in Mumbai was on 3rd March I still remember the date and I track that auditionHDFC Bank I was supposed to play some petrol like some someone on the petrol petrol pump station I got it has this city love me and I got it and after that of course one out together with nothing but people were very very helpful people were positive in those two years did you have a positive mindset I have I had your I had a full positive mindset also my mother release supported me like what is she tell you should just tell me just be added in a work hard youadmin she must have seen something she was always there for me with you believe in yourself at that point I didn't believe in myself I was very positive I am my blood group is also be positive hello I was pretty sure it would work out maybe it might take some time but I didn't know I was not sure how long would I go yeah but I was sure that it to get into it and get some some work I am gonna action films please I should like to roam around on my bike with some apology ka packet in a fruit or a kothanks for Hardware not only too much money they were at the time I was living with a friend of mine and I had some lighting 80 rupees in my account and he had some 2008 in this account is like a man what what we can do about the dinner today we call another planet fast and we are still no can we can share your mail using those times but but with a happy face we never saw that it was not getting tougher maybe we should try something else live cover people around me who told me that want to try television you knowit my busy I don't know it even though it's not easy but I I never wanted to do anything else Apartment films Gordon through this whole struggle face what was the lowest point what are the point where you almost about to break whenever there was no money and and that happened quite a lot when you feel that you suddenly she is no money in my account but then you have friends that it has become unity and we all really love each other we know anybody from FCI up if you areki aap best time care about safety in API is the best time of their life so I think to call their friends everywhere so good ko and meet them and share a meal with them but one thing which I kept in which made me really happy was with Airtel all the actors out there were trying to make a bag that don't just stayed at home doing nothing what are used to do this because I I want to activate day of my life but still want to activity of my life so v34 of electrons of Mind would just get togetherGuddu some seen work some improvisation work and that would give so much happiness trust me that would make us feel like a Aaj Kuchh kiya like something was your mind busy electric remained very busy I never really and luckily I was not into anything wrong alcohol smoking drugs Nadiya you simply will go down because of that we were not put down but I am but I've seen people that you're not taking taking it little likely that the Carriers and lightly and doingI want to like careerlight career lightly but maybe they could have worked more harder than what they have done what is what is like the core trade and you that actually got you this would you say that this thing of keeping yourself busy always I was really hard working hours in Delhi are used to cycle from Gurgaon to Delhi almost 70 kilometres up and down so I know if I have to be somewhere I am ready to really push myself I can baby I can't be the moreit but I can be I can work really hard rock and work hardest so that is something which really got me going what are your financial turning point like what are the wide web money became little easier sau percent happened in 2010 LSD for which I got paid 11000 rupees which was nothing actually then I did Ragini MMS for which I got around 1 lakh rupees are not 100000 would have one lakh rupees in my account has used and then I think since after that I wasjust watching constantly evolving lot of light supporting Patan lot of penzance of Wasseypur Shaitan Kailash Rao was getting paid decent amount I am like to relax 3 lacs 4 lacs to after that I think about surviving but then the turning point happened maybe in 2016 I think when after Bareilly ki barfi got it and how did it change things for you financially new real life in my real lifeManisha Mein record gives you that comfort it takes a lot of stress and also I am I am I was like I am I send money back home also I try and like you know give them as discomfort is I can't it is there for me it's my family but I think apart from that doesn't really do much to me I still don't bleed take it too seriously I can never really left film for former it isn't supported by product features a by product this give you some comfort in life but apart from that I think it'sit's the work that you do with that a driving force today you want to put out 8 yaar absolutely I want to put out exciting Part I want to challenge myself as an actor I want to surprise you with by the lower and then every film only thing that keeps me going with every day this used to be about content at the forefront of the whole content Revolution keep taking a risk and Debris on following Nuvve Nuvvedo you see yourself that when you see yourself as a leader of a change is a very very simple life I I do my work I go back home I am really simple guy would be roaming around in his boxer and and and onion at home and would be watching you can feel I will be washing utensils with the way my own food would take to go to Godrej supermart to do shopping I do I do everything on my own you look you can find me in Juhu eating golgappaKash pahle Tu very very simple life I don't take anything to say exam you know your the struggling face I will ki everyone goes to any kind of struggle is always give them one weapon which you can use of the rest of the life you what was that weapon by words starting with teacher which are still using even today the kind of childhood I had it was very adventurous I saw all kinds of people when I was growing up and up pick up pick up pick up a lot of my childhood but I'm using it in my performance is nowthat was the reason this a life is the biggest teachers 50 connector that if you can observe just yourself properly how you behave in situations that you can recreate that honestly Ne performance is that will do a lot of job of yours and you put a lot of yourself into your acting write more than myself I now have started taking off from life now because I start think like my characters not I'm not really trying to put myself now let the hold the way I say hello in Bareilly ki barfi like hello that so my brother-in-law speakand those apps thing that you seen in and made in China that the picture my sister send me some two years back of my nephews would like 4 at that time and they were just my brother just made like the six pack with brown sketch pen and I thought that that's very fascinating and I kept with me that I used one day and then here I got some chance where I could just been made those six pack with that yah sketch pen so apk from life also now for what made you seen this movie made in China like was that wonderfulmagic magic super exciting journey of this guy Raghu Mehta know it is a struggling Gujarati Businessman and I could relate to his journey is also somebody who is very inspiring who won't give up easily make us feel so many time was still at it so I could relate to him because he never had a plan B Adda plan is only thing you want to do in life in any want to be very successful that it is only thing I wanted to do in life to be an actor and the way I think it's been returned itpeacock eats its very funny is very entertaining but still the heart its its heart is at the right place near the most important thing trailer looks like the movie is about hard work and half filled in a waypicking up the accent to gain weight at to be somebody else on the whole shift in body language and the cat that starts talking to you after few days it will just tell you way to go it will start guiding you that you should stand like this and you should walk like this and that's how you gonna laugh it happens with me I don't leave plan it just comes to me naturally I find that so amazing so magical you know I really like all movies but this one standard movie for me like a reward them and I think of you and all the movie that made me really noticebootstrapped right time special when you are done that and it was such a dark movie in a way that one scene I don't remember your cooking a bird try to get that wasn't able to actually do something you start clapping and all the minutes of very daksin could you elaborate a little bit on the movie and what it was a person in your real life it gave me a lot of Black Out while shooting wowgreat story I am at Vikram Sarabhai in a big fan of his work I always wanted to work with them so I might Wonder screenings and he told me that I know is turning this film is just the ones like one liner that this guy stuck in an apartment without food water electricity and that's a sorry I am doing it would be so much to do for me to delete challenge me and on top of that was Vikram Motwani is why I thought you know it's the best combination I can never getand we started shooting we started as we went away in an order like it was very the way it's supposed to be in the film that were shooting is also I was doing my behaviour during the years I was losing weight in the process but I it was great you know I am not many people have seen that film but was seen it they all say the same thing it's your best work till date and that's what I I want it I I actually want to stay in that house for those 20 days but the production thought it would be very dangerouswrong we don't want to take responsibility but that's the film will give me a chance to really get deep into it I started living areas like I stop eating I stopped having water I give my own blood to the film and vegetarian is this because of dedication like is a side elevation view of aircraft is this is the kind of stories have heard from the actor that have influenced me now let you know Daniel day Lewis and property neuro Philip Seymour Hoffman and I think that's the only for nocoronavirus and I really can't Fake it I need fake things in life also like I can't Li Hogi myself with food and then go and act like I'm so hungry oh my god that it also makes it so much like troublesome life you'll have to add double its better to just not eat and then just be yourself in the character if someone asks a normal college Khati who is the best actor in the country a lot of them will name you so lot of people consider you like the top you can put a character is really well I have tothe something you built over time and the question is do you feel every film you can even better Logon athlete get better when they're playing more when a batting we become better the better so you feel something like that for you to verify your getting better I want to have to go with everything that is for sure that's a conscious effort that I am going waterline like as an active ok Nau I want to around and challenging myself with every character like they were next to him that you will see the can be some really simple character but I want to just push my limitI did something which makes my job very hard it gets very tough sometimes but as a fun I see you know I just I can't just go and see my lines and come back and look the same in every morning and you can I am talking really love acting and your in this industry for acting with the experience that is giving you an human-level absolutely I recharge to activate in interviewdo that I feel so happy ke you born for this I think so now when I look back and that's why you're probably had was Goosebumps when you saw the cell no even now you are now whenever I am travelling in my car if I see some light some where some should happening I ruled out my window AC kiske and by the shooting Ke Leja Resometime chatting with release Aaj friends on the basis of how much money they made ok I think that numbers numbers numbers play a big game here and that is something which actor should be in a worry about the only thing which I would like to change that in some because when you're in my say this to everyone would you know how much money Godfather has made butAkhilesh making at the box office that's why I always believe in a Legacy that even a leave behind its not nobody would remember that he has made 130 crore yeah it's a good thing people would say history was a unique a very is a Cult film we get the first horror comedy is there are people who talk about Shahid are trapped in a made in China Newton on waiting China so people so I want to that's how I see it saying that of course I want my friends to make money because that we can get more work and B can do make excitingbut we should we should not only be charged when was on the basis of in how much they do in a box of what your mental zone right now for your career I understand you enjoy films but obviously have to look out for the brand Rajkumar Rao also to I really don't you come to prr that only complete my we are people have with me that we need to need to book of unit 2 way to do this they do that and I like done with my work I want to go back home and have something on Teluguplay with my dog to watch on YouTube what what you

2 Life is Beautiful discuss the messages to the message that you know you still can be happy and sophie's joy that every dark film but it really had a great impact on me and what Hindi films any blood donate name three Overcome Indian Hindi film Swades I really was very goodhand tractor did you feel connected to the movie that Luck By Chance with Farhan Akhtar was that feels right after I started out in 2009 and it came I was there was anything that will Bandhan devil scene of you know their Amazon one day I just need them and you know this scene at the end of the film waiting Congress and

head wow I am considering that I am working on my accent because I need to have some American accent their own that that that they would get going on in that only thing I think about think about what should I do is doing water wash my brand is Virat KohliVirat Kohli all Carriers that was like facing a bolo to only care about the next bol that your facing any play that really well and that were actually build up your career and more in the summer your following that same theory so my question to you is due look at anyone in modern India who get inspiration from even today will not be looked up to you who you look up to in modern India I I looked up to Virat of course I look up toKailash satyarthi I think that's again greeting that he's doing it's only people I don't know them Shahrukh Khan my name is that of course that is always therestarting out to be on the floor is this great energy and winners till now this whole digital boom that is having the country anybody can just achieve your dreams you don't really have to just think of that I want to act in French OTV you can do what you want to do a lot of people look up to you not just an active but just as someone who is followed his back and made it big Kyon genuinely done what is love what is your message for a lot of people who are struggling to kind ofthe passenger timing money of the passion but they're not able to pull it takes time patience patience Agar itna is Utha to sab kar lete but you have to have faith in yourself you have to have faith in whatever that you want to do your talent and effort will be times they will be people around you might tell you to do things otherwise other way or do something else altogether but do not listen to them just do not give up hang on Badi it it it will happen just this be as crazy about waterlife is just give or give it whatever you have and it will turn out well and show when you are on the Rise Lord we pray tell you that my Aaya Nahin Hoga aapse so in this moment what did you tell yourself that get yourself pumped I get acting as I said I kept watching great friends I I used to write my own monolock size to prepare them perform them you can working basic networking maybe I was not making money with that work police I was working I was very happy workingTom what do you think is 81 trade and other than hard work that got you like this far am I say this also quite often you know you need to ask yourself why why are you doing what you doing so I think my reasons are are are maybe at the right place I am doing it because I feel very passionate about it I am I never going to be an active because I want to make money on I want it Fame the reason was always because IRangeela beta January feel very passionate passionate about it to have your reasons why did you doing it for money make money and do whatever you want to do whatever kind of things you want to do but then maybe you might not have a really in a long career ahead of you should wait for the right reasons why I think my reasons are right I feel for someone who goes to work but you don't look at it is worth a look at it is like fire it is it is not work what is your opinion on like God and like the universe and things like that larger than lifeI believe that I I believe in universe I believe in you believe in all gods I think there is definitely Supreme Power out there do you think about it for your Kariyo I pray pray everyday I I definitely believe that there is somebody out there was looking at you ok so I do that also gives me Lenovo is like you talking to you you talking to someone you can you can just put your heart out images tell whatever you want to say and carried out inUniversal so I think that this cute out to the universe and positivity William badi badi will come back if you experience this on your own career I have I have lekin what we as I said I was I was trying not to be negative ever was being very positive and that's the only message I kept giving

the ladies dance for this right nowAdarsh biceps really made of their point table right now I just need a spiritual energy what you doing and what you're trying to do a wonderfulSS to the overall Holistic health has meditation healthy eating and wife of complement and you like most of the journalist interview is44 Euro focusing on what's important and that the inside and if the inside is cleaned it will reflect on the outside and I know you believe the same I think it's the fact that I think team I am mean and that kind of radiates on the outside and you like you know the site of that it shows upfor the audience question because I am diet plan please what do you thinkI decided not to eat after 7:30 consciously and that happens baby 95% of the time so unless you know it's it's a situation where a may be doing a night shift or I couldn't eat for some reason the food court prolong the universe important to meet you know to finish my work then maybe I will extend my timing but then again I'm conscious about that I am 1that you know I eat after 12 hours the next morning so I've been practicing the whole intermittent philosophy on AC without contriving it on on on my own so all that is coming to play now and that was the one changes made in the other change a major change was giving up or defined rules so whether it be a white sugar white flower so that was another majoryou don't have any like fix pattern of eating video avoiding you follow a eating pattern like intermittent fasting high protein and now I have become Aryan but I can say that a 95% vegetarian 25% pescatarianrequest you to like talking things of things and people think that you know because I'm in love with the funny thing is I don't leave it slowly and graduallyI didn't wake up one day and you know it in the vegetarian palungi 1 year ago I will like pagal ho to look USA non-vegetarian how to show an intense Amin saying that I ceiling $2 off fibre lot of vegetarian fair in my in my diet plan but I enjoyed my workoutmuscle mass bone density and you probably keep up and when you end up eating vegetarian you feel that your end up eating more carbs that you make in your head and its kind of food that you choose to eat that decides on how you look for now then when you are 2544and I am very healthy touchwood so and I want to continue to be like this I want to be my feet is based on the day on the day I die butused to be I don't know without any comparison I can just say that my strength my core strength is much more today than than before I concentrate on it you know I can like about this like we were at least he knew transition into becoming a fitness influencers on social media dukan like that someone like you are influencing the whole country to keep up with their fitness with the help and hopefully the spirituality going for something thatI wish people would focus on the spiritual aspect of it so you could be Hindu Muslim Christian it really doesn't matter spirituality has something to do with belief and Faith and it has nothing to do with a particular kind of religion it has a means faith in the better good evolve as a better versionso I read a lot of spiritual book myself and all those reading this paragraph yesterday from this very like renowned spiritual author said that spirituality according to the engine Yogesh definition of it is definitely like meditation and all that is a part of it but basically for the average human being it boils down to living simply living positively and living income about everything that's going on so I think Twitter is one thing that anyone can apply buttons in all this I wasyou made people meditate we need to ask you about meditation and more specifically on ask you about your mum who kind of got you into this and that is on is the OK coming from the other side of Bollywood like the view a site that this whole room at your mum is one super spiritual to she kind of at that face of a liver you got the whole big brother you know that turn happened she had like and advisor key in a userok so is this contemporary theory is that true difference she always tell me but she did tell a lot of people around me that you are my Shilpa has a lot in store for her what she was she is achieved right now is just the tip of the Iceberg and I was actually going through a Lal in my career at that point during Big Brother places around 12 years ago and she had told someone not someone shouldhello people that it was Shahrukh I remember during Baazigar the Shilpa is going to attain world famous not just in India every mother things like the child is going to and the kind of unprecedented it was shocking for me and I neverhot in my wildest dreams I would win the show I was ready to actually leave the house every week and my my mum you talked about my mum in spirituality yes it definitely is handed down to me from the practicing meditation for really long time she would sometimes you know be in a conversation and I would see your hands move and she is actually praying she prays for people that she doesn'tthe ship that there is not even family suffering should pray for them that kind of an unconditional love is very difficult to find this time in age of all people my next question is will heavy my question to you is that what is going on in your whole business career as well because that was very active part of your life but you are looking about the people don't know how much into business Shivaperson who when you put your glasses on a different person so so like like not literally but all your calculations and all come on table with numbers I have I don't consider myself someone with business acumen also I am not saying you are saying it trying to be humble and honest what I have is intuition and what I amis a very clear a sense of direction in my head of where I see myself over I think I need to do to elaborate on the integration partners I really believe that most human beings at this book and time table with names but you know it's that flicker that sense of the minute you see something you you gave your feelingquestion on it and then what happens is that we lose focus and then we go into due diligence whether this is right for us or not for that uses the instance that you see that situation or the thing that you want to you know delve into that instant is the truth your first Instinct about a person or situation as the truth but most people slip into the calculated with that moment that what you thinkperson that situation this business on the face of it I will approach it is alsoworking on that occur in tuition continuously increases and is something I felt as well like and the practical use of it in the modern world is business one right behind it that people don't focus on is called the Bindu Chakra ok pointsthe brain of its own it's a person itself and we are functioning because each one is working to improve your career and even when we started the app I was hell bent on doing it on introducing it through the app and we done it and I really feel you know when yourOm you are aligned with your crush you automatically feel the sense of power you feel in control of your faculties and I will be really losing out on that it's because we are not aligned I also feel again it's there is this yogic concept that talks about inner peace and their three layers toward the first is your Physical health that need to be fixed second is a mentalI thought just spiritual health so I am I would I would interchange that a little bit I would say first your mental health and if you meant if you functioning will appear at mind of a body that don't want to clean your Physical health will be better if your habits or bad like a very balancing and food everyday smoking everyday things like that it create an environment for negative thoughts and I think you attractyou attract what you want if you want to go down that path you will attract it so you have to choose what party want also I feel that why I YouTube worldstar YouTube isn't a you initially at all so your face or no I mean not not YouTube ads and the difference but the brand money that we get a fantasticbasically it's a good life now but when you are saying I was in a lot of people then and my speciality training was meet Bros Premier League and actually witness was a given this the three-month period of training people of getting the change habits and all that they actually start becoming more positive so sweet Physical health comes for mental health come second welcome Chhod but I do feel for someone to reach the third aspect of spiritual health and even considering that as important unit of these 2 pictureopportunity for you and me we taking care of Physical health earlier in life that doesn't happen to everyone background of sports so that was ingrained in a system that you know we had to have a certain discipline in our life and I was introduced in his people don't even have that like your roomtaken away from so I don't know why this is old misconception of Myth with the word discipline with the word diet that we avoid using these words on what are there in your life like different butmy life easy I have a I have team that make my life easy with their some jobs I can delegate and there are some I can't I can't really get the job of looking good on a day of an important shoot I mean by sleep I can't really get the job of I can delegate one aspect of it for mother would but youI am on mother and so is my husband so for eyes that is our priority how does each person is different class and those values are very dear to mewant to consciously let go of those values while I enjoy the fact that I am in a position of power and I love my Fame and unapologetically so but I am very clear that my day will start and end with my child so that is a very clear demarcation said that you really can hold a middle-class I will cornerstone in your life what are the middle class values that you want to pass on your childmiddle class part of that so what one would you go to pass on them to what you are afraid of sow the seed of fear because it will grow into a I don't like to put that they say that say something you are seven seconds to retract it Will manifest and I am very careful about what I say to you I I really I lookwhat the future I don't know what it has in store for fovea 9 me all I can say is that I am trying to do my best as a mother and I wish that I am able to make him understand the importance of work ethics the importance of spirituality the importance of the better good and I always say one line to him what you give you getand Somewhere Out There deeply so Din his subconscious I don't want to force my viewpoints on you are just the body and you are you are there to just be part of your child's journey so this is really just the catalyst and he has to pay the part himself and you can't wanting to be a certain person has to learn to be that he will grow into that when youfind your path and your calling on your own one day and I am Sofia I will find that your pardon calling with you all I want to know like when bad things happen your debut before that what was invented by you expecting that this is the life you will be enteringplease do interviews and everything from my perspective to my voice to OBC my looks everything is changed my life with rose tinted glasses you don't have any experience is the best teacherlearnt or learnt this from anyone else you have to go through experiences on your own you brought up in a spiritual family you do have a kind of rose-tinted glasses you believe that the world will be as nice as your family and used you have many instances where like ok maybe my family nicer than this world experiences like thatthey may have had their own reason to be a two way that it so I I have selected Amisha I really I really believe that the more you hold on the more you know the less I don't have to say this the more you hold on hold hot call yourself for somebody else's bad days why you punishing yourselfselect permission my hard disk in only have all the good memories I delete all the bad memories are all the bad experiences and I love this life I love the experiences good bad ugly whatever they have taught me the person I have become it just makes you more Street smart talking your figure out one thing for sure that you Innova the extremely positive and this is the external worldbecomes a reflection of your internal world your happiness is a very Real world question which is that and this is something about me I will my last thing I do at night in the first thing in the morning really affect my whole thought process which in turn affects my internal world and therefore my so whats the first and last thing you do in a day and is there something to consciously with the you do that what is itSecrets of the first and the last thing I do is get the same Express gratitude award night why you have some can one night time routine nothing 6:30 normally and Inspiron 11 1137 meditation happenwhat tired I am it doesn't stop me from your meditating those last 15 minutes of the day advice to them slowly and just consciously try to just blank your mind I will change your life you feel your password how long have you beenGilbert even difficult so much happening that you need a sense of you need you need a sense of calm at some point I need a place where you can find it and that places within yourself to leave the country your go-to holiday destination to find come so it's it's there within you just need to tap or rather than that though it happens in meditationone place I find myself actually I also feel that your internal world is a reflection of the people you hang out with and your social media feed your 100% so my question to you is one to consciously choose and cut of people immediately coconut and hang out with you if I don't have very few friendswhy people think that are very friendly and I embrace everyone that comes into my life make them feel very loved and then I take a step back and I close the door that I have just those few people that it's not like they do the people I embrace don't know the real me what you see is what you get with me but the very few peoplethat I can sit and have long conversations with like if there are in trouble in a jiffy I am there because your spiritual and also Gemini actually andunderstand I like I think even as I have grown spotted I want to keep all of the energy to myself and my cloud wanting to myself I feel like you know some people can be such energy vampires I want to keep away from because I can't I can't do want my energy to be diluted and you don't believe will living in this fast paced life for you requiredownload the weather ji and I really feel that you know sometimes I am I am slapped I need to gain and energy to open online material wealth in this whole like spiritual game I where does that lie with nothing solike I said we live in Kalyug are so whatever I on I enjoy and unapologetically so but tomorrow I don't have it got for bit I'll be happy there is well so I am a middle class girl that came from Chembur from a two-bedroom home touchwood I have all all of this and a beautiful family butdrive me honestly Ranbir doesn't drive me the stronger one last question is that after talking to you and getting to know you like to this conversation your one of the happiest human being the spoken to likeeverything I not just you to generally when I see people their smile determines the kind of people they are some of them even at photograph behind so most of them are actually started in the smiling in front that actually a very positive photograph a picture where the person behind the mask is actually smiling and that for me is important and smiling on the face of it or notwhat is smiling and happy that that is important to the end of the day and a lot of listening to a heavy esoteric conversation I was thinking that I feel like it's very easy for us to say or judge that you know the chasing much material wealth me be there is something that is still searchingso we been there done that maybespiritual health I think I just discovered meditation through YouTube the that thing happened really like it was 23 of meditating all day and things like that and three boxes physical mental and it gives you a lot of balance income for the rest of my life but my question to you is when you go back to the 23 year old version of yourself what is the physical health advisor mental health awareness spiritual health advice would you give themI just feel that things come to you at a certain age for certain reason so that was your journey at 23 I had the worst heartbreak like I said I butte the Europe viewed people with roasted rose-tinted glasses and I thought I'd never be able to come out of that I was I was in Asiareally long time and then I decided to improve myself and you can we all go through those those feelings of insecurity you know am I good enough why why does this happen to me and I just feel that is a journey that we have to take that didn't happen this person in front of you won't be thisso I really feel that pin has to be embraced and you have to live in that moment XP experience that pain and then you have to come out of it if you go to wallowing in self-pity and if a girl pic that birthday in and project along with you throughout your journey is going to be really difficult for you to live so for all those people who have been through suffering it's only normal at every person suffering issame you can't you know this no value in terms of euro weight or Europe in bill of your quantify you can't want to buy a used car paint mere se kam specifically in the whole self improvement happened after that what did you do for your physical bodyI decided to save Garden all then start building a wall in a that's the one one thing I started doing it and it's not in a negative way it is it important to kind of decide ke liye sahi hai aur yah Mere Liye Nahin as we go through pain and then we still doing those backbends and you break your back one dayladke beyond this point I will not banned by Park so that is what life experiences teach you to the ones who learn from their own experiences or actually the stupid once the ones you learn from others experiences August part 1 I learnt from my own and I realise that this is as much as I will take in my life after the war on heartbreak and the second one happened in the third and every heartbreak and realise that myreducing but eventually found your soulmate and then you are willing to do the like the chakrasan with thank you through these conversations I have always something I take on my own spiritual journey I'm trying to eliminate negative life thoughtsB negative thought on not being connected but the effective from you is not judging people even with that one person judgement which is a heart for take away from a while listening to it human to judge but I judge Annamalai why my chargingthe happiest person I don't care what people are doing what they do what they want to do in their life mein Apna Karam karna chahti creating business creating fitness is using all thatdoing what they do what they want to do in their life mein Apna Karam karna chahti creating businesses creating fitness is using all that to manifest a beautiful world

that I have learnt Nothing from my mistakes are made from the past which is being able to make time for myself and recognising that myself what is not in work but it belike what you explain this dude wide why ask you also this thread why is that all our shelf what is compound productivity why is success in career so important why is it that an element of masculinity also in this why is success equals to career success only why is in success measured in Abacus for small business thing as herhappiness is a journey not a destination why success if you have a great career if you made a lot of money if you got enough we empower the Reservoir is it not I have been a good friend and the royal family member and at the weather was that this world was designed that your your metric of success is equal to that which a lot of us often forget to question so that is also the worst part of life when I am like I was also feel that something I picked up from you while trainingattitude line even on Sundays Like I Remember train your mind and with youCowboy call daddy issues and will get address both of these so but I will close your dad wi live streaming you after training at Golden house and he would encourage me ki have Puch Puch Roi Main Hardik all my friends are close to my dad except for me and I'll tell you what do you Daddy issues also motivation and you know it is not that may be used for weight loss for me it was so1 baisa need for me to go to office at 11 O'Clock group as a fat kid realise that if I if I don't have looks what can I have the writer known for study study study study study school was over I would likewise blocks what can I own an extra curricular f****** go to every festival possible right and once college good over evil ago I am still I'm still ugly what why do I what can I own nowOLX letter writing listing to immediately start making money and once that happens when this is also I guess I'm just 31 among some other people could lead to do something that school where can I get more attention what is an immediate way of gratification the audience laughing at you which is the best way of saying they like you so it's not a good thing that they need to have this is quick keep saying Asal Hustle not good thing when I remember when you when your heartgood thing as important as 22 yeah well when you're asking you recently saying that I want I want this so badly I'm willing to sacrifice everything else for it that tells a void that you can feel by getting a it's a good it's a good believe I think there is no point to life generally so you create games and then you play the game extremely well so if your game is really want a YouTube channel to get a million if you want to set up your ownEmpire that just play that game format you know happy Dosti I will the meaning of life is whatever you want the meaning to be rude so I will for this stage how you are like this is your like success is beyond just career success but is different definitions and 25 when you like building a problem you are absolutely right meaningI would like to I like to order created this way meaning of life is life the point of life is to create goals and you should only create gold which helps to attain flow should use the JPEG of lower let me tell you for those who don't know what fluid flow is when the challenge that you post yourself and the skills that you have are matched if the challenge is too difficult and it doesn't match your skill then you be anxious if the changes to easy andis overpowered that they will be too easy when you get will you be second Bodom floor is when this good challenge and your skills macha when you achieve floor and if your goals have this floor then you are likely to continue want to this every every time you achieve one goal is to find next goal and I like how can I can I find my fluid which were a lot of youtubers is that single piece of content that I don't know about Convent pieces on the table is a lot of low sometimes motivational videoexample if you can't and motivation into the world of low top 3 worst moment of your life is my life one of them was 12th standard result came about 65% as remember I was outside outside Mithi bythe commerce section displays agar aap Sabhi vahan per Humko exam ke marksheet for the and I got 60% go back home so I had all my all my pocket money save I was binge eating my feelings where was eating Frankie Frankie and crying Meme another Frankie wala send email is my my Frankie so bad that you are so big it makes no sense and I didn't go home I just I refuse to take any cause the V mobile anatomy calling how much to getI was I score 90% in my 10th maths like a dramatic drop I was one f*** in terrible day second 100 of places second one second one was I think I think my my parents sobbing after the Sachin Lata controversy and asking me why do you want to continue comedy can you quit typing hospitableI think it's just the stress that my parents went through my dad had a bypass and he was still like why is still happen to my Sankalp the rose happen just say you before that so in order to explain to them that my life choices will affect you at some point I was very hard third one is reading all the every employee is goal after that everything was a temporary table I think it was the first and the four of us were in a room with the whole office and my broken house is crying and and the thing is that there is no way to explain to themexcept for saying that this is this is it guys is nothing else we confirm it didn't even believe me and as a first migraine for everyone that was pretty bad now in hindsight I look at that moment and I feel like every single person who worked a d i v has managed to get a much higher paying job from heavy is extremely happy right now there killing it is some of them are founded new companies are the people are you know just living a great solid life which I think to some extent was theI want to be the only of Comedy Nights analysis and you came to everyone's believe it's like you been to Institutions like getting another degree so that was that felt pretty good I your letter after seeing all this I feel like over one's killing it now if I call them back now saying hey you are I am I want to Skechers Mein chain Lagane wale like I'd love to do it but I don't wanna do this fault I have a good life now and I would never want them to go back to you knowPDF pic I love that I love I love meeting people when they are on the cusp of exploding and working with them for your to and watch them go I think this is some other things I learnt in the last year is India has a very zero-sum mentality India believes that someone person success means your taking success from other people people don't realise that everyone can be successful everyone can make moneyjust need to put your skin in the game and help them in your so for example the associate team this had their own company call one hand clap which now I am a part of invest in the company is now the handley episode me also but they also do they don't think the kids between two 23 year old and nobody nobody ever imagine that these guys would they refused to work without each other they form their own company and there wasn't death forstill in bed Mila sure and decide their own company and they helped us repair power that date devices like your there was our home and what kind of date in cross road we had over night we lost all brands disappeared in Vivo V12 fund company right we were literally operating Bade money by becoming Rotary mess in the company was after they were funded Chintu the movie Chintu was supposed to play at festivals if we were discussing Chintu getting bought out by some auditor platformAdolf it disappears to Sun Li we were looking at our bank statement last year in October view like we only have money to like November and don't have more even sure that we had projects and we had shot but we can't breathe out which meant that production costs is gone already you live in the middle of making a show for Amazon philosopher already happened for which vehicle report for the money is given that we had a lot of people earn money does it hurt youright now that fact no not really in the sense that hurt me as in its maths do you have to pay people who work for you but it's it's been an immensely big fascinating and experiences you I was so lucky to everybody who owed money to was like it's you guys I trust you guys you as a pick yourself up and be there and luckily for Akash and team sharodo Akash Akash and team they they were like its finalwe got bigger super lucky I am in touch with the Boys Ashish about one of us is happening Ashoka Garden Amazon the heavy YouTube channel isn't doing anything as it now but these other projects happening does a movie is going on floor from here we first draught in february I am working on toModi from presented by a visa Lord happening so I wasn't touching everything everyone's where busy also is going around think to yourself Special 26 short when I am working on my special and I am a gamer now apparently have we get we get your gaming channel 2 but again going back to like this whole Phase III moment you spoke about was the darkest of the three I think so I thinkI think it was because I understand the kind of place I would buy sand monkey in my heart attack my baby and Shoaib was the same to you do yeah it was dark is because it was in one moment I said questioning my whole life right because I spent the last part of the last 10 years building building this company and I spent the last for the last 10 years with the people that I was working with soap for a period of 12 months when I didn't have a place to gooffice to go to address this was the couch and I should just slip on and wake up at come here at set at 81 and the for lunch that would slip on this couch and wake up again at 58 in a good sleep do it was not only sad will also revelatory for me because I just for cement like if I don't have a office to go to what am I even a person and HRM and by this was the best your of my life because I can't so much about myselfso it was dark is because it was also it was extremely dark but was also extremely and lightning the factor Elisa duaaen habol am I not a person if it's not my work am I do I not deserve to you had every intention of personal reason to live after 8 months I am a person I can do things and just because this is happened doesn't mean you can't get up to 10 years of your life right so Jab aapkiki Kami rahti hai na aur jab kam nikalna like mein meri aukat kya duniya mein Dar Dar se question Aaye ask myself so I was extremely dark but the fact that I was able to get up today and still start doing shit it's amazing I know you are the guy I know that you are genuinely a respectful person a lot of people in the read things online exams in the body human beings like that and I think so you think I've learnt okI will make you have been in the news concession for 5 years it was one thing I've learnt everything reading the news and honestly the truth but here is how the news was also I won't make any comments for everything anything news news is news follows use right so it's no longer about the truth the truth is extremely complicated and nuanced and the news is meant to be sexy and fast fruit is not sexy and fast and root x very long to understand it's like about Kashmir I to someoneman said it and about Kashmir and you are like ok here is what I have read about Kashmir let's go back 60 70 80 years ago when India is a country was being formed this person mere ko abhi ki covid-19 why we gone by 60 70 years ago but if you want if you want something to understand something that it requires context with the news has enough space for news abhi share karo abhi use karo to I would suggest for most peopleStop looking at the news as the absolute truth start using your using a brain possible don't consume every piece of news that you see and what the what this does is it makes people start judging people thinking that everybody is a black or white there is no grey fact is everybody is very nobody is black but nobody is white Aaj we are ready to get angry on people without thinking for a second because Ham Sab gussa isliye humko bhi like chahieinternet fundamentally changed the day retweets for invented the day they were like buttons in the comment section of a youtuber Instagram because that's it start giving people and incentive to behave in a way that could get them likes and not react January to anything so for example Chetan Magar Kuchh to eat Karega Ham sab log Chaku Ghar Banduk Lekar taiyar hai ki Hamen Tiger even if it is saying make sense where is ready because we have you need there is a section of people who havethree-dimensional adjusting for whatever it is so I wouldn't recommend people who read the news and the people don't don't don't do that it's it's an healthy for you it makes your sense of judgement impaired and not the entire perspective is not the and its order and a perspective I can tell you this much write the people who are least accepting of other people's floors are unaware of their own floss anybody who I am made who wouldjudgemental all it means if they have not introspected and thought about yourself because if you have Hai MP3 for others it just means you are also self aware if like you meet someone top attitude like how can I knew that the person or it means you're not hot body roll cups to Tumi anybody who showed me very little MP3 around that time I am now realise that you have your own processing to do I feel bad for you to khud ke bare mein Soch Kiya Ja fir baat karte hain to the grave Gali Dena Tu Karle but long termwhat would you have done differently had left back in the days when is can it again 3 things one different thing I've done it had a so who was just focused on running the company I think I think I was too rough around the edges I didn't know I was to court it's like to have a low powered the thing is I think that a great so focuses on the company rightbut I was also I am also an artist soul or the time is my judgement was impaired because my brain is not focused on am not able to prioritise things effectively I think as an art is it was tougher to run a company because your priorities and isn't a brief is in the company all the time and also as an artist art is also think about yourself it was in a company that was about me the company has about 40 of the people and they had four founders and what not so yeah that one thing I think find peopleexcellent and wanted to urinate to do everything it delegate find people who are make things not about you also realise that serve as a leader I was extremely insecure which is why I think in hindsight like lekin yaar how do I explain about your own capabilities insecure about my own capabilities which would manifest in ways in front of your employees in a waymight not necessarily for example a leader is supposed to be extremely giving extremely Patang everybody else first the best leaders are those who bring out 20 exam people right but when the leader in self is not extremely secure how can I have someone else be secure right I think I was ensocare think I I was insecure as a person when I die don't think for a I learnt to lessons extremely late like you talk to fix a day will tell you can my managing us in the first three years in the last two years is completely different so I think it's one thingif most bad bosses are bosses were themselves in secure the best bosses are people who have already figured out in these are my strength is my weaknesses everybody is a possible be sure to do better but those not not working what is the terrible Tomay think people were more secure about themselves make better bosses cause I think in most cases managers who are cruel adjust compensating for the role in securityinherently bad I think people at bad and that's a manifestation of the Ring security having Patang employees down means you are trying to put yourself up means you are trying to protect your own sense of Identity I am gonna tell you something that not only for private old versions of it I feel like even training you I can use blessing back in the day with a genuinely feel like you're my first mental in this Kariyo new hairstyle use don't know you give me you give me opportunity I remember being at 152006 fibres and I just wrote and emotional mail for drunk and a message on Facebook and wont charge do I change your life Bar Bar message kar raha I think I think that period was that it was also I think and learn to be self sufficient after that period we did it for the first time that period of one or two years where I learnt that over in a fitness is notRocket Science you can understand if yours is discipline that period It helped me see it happening today today I don't need I don't need it Arena in that sense it soundsport me but I largely know the science behind nothing I think I was also be extremely curious that point I remember while working out keep asking you questions for this is great to know I learnt here to learn ships within that period was great I learnt it like I did the diploma in fitness what is basics of being healthy so that it was a it's aliveeveryone should have better going to get through it doesn't mind your curiosity not you want to get it it it it was the same for me when I feel like if I give you fitness knowledge you give me a lot of knowledge about to eat them put on weight no no you ok with you might be offensive to your principal ready don't turn on my couch India that I think I think slap you I I think you don't give yourself an upgraded it yourselffree of cost so much more fun even funnier to be said definitely did but I have picked up a lot of Malaria mindsets with when I look back doors were ki kind of character building things that aid of the long I really changed your life and your life okpositive and negative person now I am a lot more positive but doesn't have generally generally have a cynical person I think it's very difficult to be a comedian FB positive at the same time the lord of why is that dude I just think and you might disagree with me I think the more life happens due the more naturally cynical you pick up because you realise Ki Duniya kyaI think the only thing that helps you out of beds which is being positive negative doesn't achieve great being cynical is great for comedy but I think positive helps you get older stuff if you are a cynical person it just have to positive friends who will who will composite function do how long back there be start live 29 2009 2010 2011 lovely 2011 and 2010it's 2019 now straight up bro bro question like money like where is that coming from right now it's hard to feel better about yourself when everyelse is living a life that you want to I move to Bangalore my friend Kunal Shah who is in Bangalore he he told me that want to surround yourself with other people who are you know doing things that's not in your domain and really help you decide use time to turn the sadness into fuel for growth later and I will help me and he always made me feel like the start of world is something that I could I will grow like knowing you as a guide or it's your strengths and I know that you are so I move to bangleConsulting for a few companies there and within a couple of months I realise that this is its great stores in Bangalore HR Consulting for a few companies are Aisa thinking of some tech ideas while I was there I surround myself with entrepreneur Sumer completely new to main I met some crazy entrepreneur there and the sun myself with people who was Mata than me in sosoon the music and within 2-3 months as a cool if I don't have a life in the I was ready to quit life in the media and do what I don't know anything I just didn't want to be in the public domain and more one particular night was sitting in talking about early days of how I were used to be in collagen atah Elisa of my mom's members in a bank that works in HR I have no business being in the media world at all forget being a comedian and a successfuland then starting something that revolutionized the way we do Karte so people say I am no business being in this world and then I was like oh my my beating myself up and it sounds simple but this realisation takes months that you can get up again so that was pretty that's pretty amazing and Bangalore and now I know at some point in life and do something Tech because the game the plane Bangalore so much better than the games we play like for exampledudh Bombay please status games Mumbai place mein itna khul ja Bombay is all about status if if someone is number 17 SB number 2 but Bangalore because I will there is some element of status games in Bangalore but largely by play Wealth Games write the investor and the start of the game is wealth game which is your successfully my success if I invest in new equilibration collaboration how can we help help each other to Bangalore is fantastic and FM Bangalore so optimistic the worst case in Bangalore is you knowso much better than the voice kids in Bombay so I loved about Bangalore people it's very much like Mumbai msmc no people come to Bombay to become something in the world of media come from small towns reply with the hope in the in the eyes with anger is very similar to that you meet people who have come from all walks of life who all are come with just one germ of an idea and they come in the mid random people I know I've met founders was living with the employees in one houseand you just ok couchette literally every day the compare conversation black did you read this article that you read this theory is you read what is philosopher acid and others like it involved are you and I would discuss is Ne Banaya iska jawab unfunny hai is dekha hai usko Twitter abhi kya bola hai what is life in which would like a lot of yoga and the worldconsidered Bangalore is a ki spiritual capital for the world as well and that there is like spirituality the also always learning and knowledge and positivity so that I think everything spiritual changes into my face is not Bhagwan Godwhat is internal self awareness self awareness is gonna be more intense than the last one year and a lot more about myself I realise that I am depend on external validation for too much night to get over that we are writing to some extent they have it is social media about Communism illness that gets to all social media Manager Pro also cause that didn't hug me hug youspiritual changes I don't know this is spiritual or no but one of the Patience is a virtue right and I think it's more things I learnt last year that life is extremely long life is crazy long and life is what you make of it and it's everything is in your holiday dishes are so true how old are you I am 32 now that younger as young I was so been doing this for feels like a bid on this for 20 years has been like time your revenue MS Word about the rest ofoh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah see how wisdom is a number of years of experience wisdom is number of experience is the year 2 I am so grateful that I had the last five years I have seen so many ups and downs but I feel like a bit Abhi To Kya Kya Karega mere ko main sab kar diya already that patients in the realisation that life is life is long enough to be in a hurry your left Hero need everything today coronavirus is spiritual awakening but your patience is a virtue is something I willimmensely now I feel like what we often don't do because of the world of social media you often don't play long-term gains we don't realise Boond Boond Se Banta Hai Sagar and Singh Associates says it's a little stuff that eventually makes a big difference to what did you learn about people through all the laws that happened I am sure lot of people that you are often just like that have one thing I learnt about people was that most people agree with think aboutbeing called a public Failure is that I was lucky that many many people came to me and told me about how they think they are immensely proud as people and there was a nice touch but I didn't have a lot of people who cut me off and stuff that I think that should have been very lucky that I have as solid as friends who were there through thick and thin and they were extremely kind and nice and I am your because of that reason and also made new friends I washave any people that cut me off I think anybody would drop through in a time of need just told I stood there is no point you want me to I mean as again because of the train no you can 2015 gram talking you now at a deeper level after a long time is not that has a deep conversation in mobile used to you would to in a bad zone back in the day rule on a much better zone right now I am not myself and I realise you like while talking to use to just switch off into tension switch offif you just be so tense about life that uses which of India is overthinking creating business started thinking about your next day but now you take a moment and Justin one place it's been a year since last year it feels like it's been 10 years it feels so long as it is in your school it's my everything possible need patience lot of people accused this distanceStates as being some events during the summer of arrogance back in the day we see this to I have to come to make your one is we often look and arrogance as a bad thing which is if someone is someone takes too much pride in what they think their great at the necessary in the second you start looking again is a bad thing what what actually happening is you are being NVS exam think you are judging someone but honestly couldTamil Rasigan right at that if you point it's 14 fingers are pointing at us all out if you think something is again actually your being judgemental a bi most most costly Mysore arrogance is largely a manifestation of its projection rate loan means to be arrogant it is there there in a really insecure the day double down on what you think you are more secure Gaya now now I am a lot more secure now a lot more happy are being likeyaar kya hai badoliya we accept it was a lot harder To Do Because deep down you genuinely feel like it's you do anything to protect that feeling that we provide an arrogant or bad because they want to protect their own self esteem I think now I am I am a lot more secure and still still in Sector 20 Nerul in second allotment secure Now doesn't like fine yaar like there's more to life than than just productivity of worklife is about your investor mode right now site and all my voice recording this three years until all of the Fighter Pilots but there will be a stage in your carrier wave to stop being a pilot Commando control room enough I listened to this is what you are doing right if you were a pilot I know you come back at the control room what you see in potential Pilots that you want to work with the potential young kidsok han ya na Dur Jayega smartsound wrong but I think so when I do my interview is not to have your kids are also often ask them to grow up for our childhood like I discuss childhood a lot more now if there are people who have some sort of brokenness it's usually an indication of drive when people MNC driven I love those people also I am very blanton embed what you want to do in life I am also very clear in saying that this is the role I want to domy life and you tell me what you want to learn from me London leave because the Indian mentality is often if I hire you then you are now mine from Singh we have a bonded labour in old old school type of way of working women for family I have that my boss my family for life with honey for life and sometimes in families to let them go to the water you gotta let them see that don't to potential sunao my approach to working people is not work with me forever uniqueItni for sometime I want to go to your own the many go to your own thing I want to be up I want to be a part of which is a much better play hundred percent the same enthusiasm is great I love lazy genius this is something that I really like I think hard work is overrated I think laziness is underrated will agree to disagree on that govern explain our perception of hard work is quantity it's not it's not quality Alizeeare people with fantastic ideas and will find the shortest quickest way to achieve whatever is required and I think laziness is severely underrated in today's young age I'll give you a given example right now I wanted a channel that would I wanted my own distribution ok and I really enjoyed gaming but what I think really is working for me is the fact that giving is a great content hack right because I havefun personality 5 play games will translate to that we can create a video of the day because of because of giving Jugaad Jugaad this item is a product of me being lazy lazy person so I would always speaker lazy genius genius over someone who is nice but it takes a little while longer so I really like people who won things are often ask is tell me something that is a question answer in Twitterthat all of your friends disagree with you about what is your opinion about that you have that you feel is possible disagree with you about that really shows radical thinking to me that really shows people who had slightly slightly more fuel is that really helps because one of the things that we have to recognise some people have to work with us they usually want to work with us because we are us something like that I am always worried about I just your because it's gonna be cool working with me or what is what is thisso I would want people around me to be Fearless in that sense that all very happy that I Ti bi I love putting young people in shoes that they should be made that time what what a deal breaker of you like the young person is done something that was refused to learn or I think close mindedness is is is a big problem for me I think people who are willing to adapt and rigidity is a big bropeople willing to adapt if you are malleable or if your brain is a rock I don't like it if your brain is a sponge is to be better with new ideas can penetrate The Rock in sponges absorb I love What youve got a corn like physical fitness now18 years now it's Bin it's been steady so I guess that I tried to walk everyday for me the first

able to processI think I'll when you are bullied as a kid you believe that you don't deserve happiness course the whole world told you that you don't deserve happiness show your body was like ok bye the Hai Magar let you lose weight would make you stay over weight loss is as much emotion processing as I get emotional processing in thought processes and outcome of the people hang out with and the

child feel secure enough its damage is done so everybody is some damage to some degree not because of anything else not cause the parents were not me Spencer trying their best but because probability is such that Kuchh Na Kuchh ho jaega parents galtiyan karte hain so you have some processing you do anyways some of it is some of it is just the way this is our species is some of it is surrounding

want some heavy should medication and other people call me and say hey you know you're looking at fat in your pictures with people who are not self made from your own industry would definitely come in true influencethe n word write you send the difference in personality and what is reported on personality there is still feel like there's only the other problems are different than say someone who is not from the industry but yes there is innate sense of surety which comes with the fact that some basicdeep rooted security that you have that your from here so it would be easier to get your way around someone who is outside what if my opportunity is not with me and I see that are seen in some really successful actors were self made and not from the film industry experience that insecurity and it's surprising ko sometimes they are so they do that doing so well with the sense of insecurity doesn't leave themalso good because a creative person that sometimes use you so if they enable the channel is that well you know that does some good Tamanna thank you thank youfirst so I am super excited and also that with this why you know if and I'm just really intrigued by How You tab into like like a side of people that they don't put out so much sign in to you are you ready for some very deep questions time is post ko we can't have deep conversations I don't think we can ever do that talked about the whole covid experience you've recoveredafter the first question do you in this is something I always ask a lot more active friends both the guys do women like me famous don't particularly enjoy the same same part of it is very humbling but I don't really because I am very very non filmy person or people you know me closely and fax numbers of people meet me there like you are not like andnot like a heroine I want to introduce you like that like really when I talk to anyone from the film industry there is this little air around that comes with ityou people think that becoming an actor is empowering and next you really like invincible you are you like nobody can touch us barasingha actually makes you a lot more valuable because every step You take and I mean honestly the Sin of moral policing the donon licence then when you become an actor it becomes like to zillion fold so I feel likeevery step You take your whether you like it or not you are taking it from the perspective of what will people think and I think a number of names and prove that what people think is one of life's are you are you happy in life now I think I have come to this point where are there lies that there is never this point that we will actually be completely happy happy to see you some that boy will always be therebreast after doing is in very consciously that is is to enjoy the small things because they realise ki are major award Jeet Ke Bhi Aati Hun Main Ghar per Aakar yah to samose Khati hun treat myself and I'm with my friends in like the most Jala cloth without makeup and I probably look like the most and capital homeless I looked and looked very like thatwhat is why I feel like whatever you're sea view room per ki aap it is a katoge aapko Sacchi Mein pasand hai very connected to who you were like before Fame came into my life but I'm sure you look around you in your industry in Assam 90 ok bye this person change so much has something gotten into themso you essentially are that the pahla paath never changes and for me that was its been I mean I was fortunate that name se mani ke my way with the kind of work I chose to do and I just choose to keep my service in that because I just didn't know any better you ready for an intense questionwarming up ok I have the void in your life right now you said that you are not completely happy that I feel like my relationship part of my life isn't completely sorted it and it will be sorted in time but that's what I'm looking for to professionally great spiritually great intellectually mentally great but public relationsone thing that is a generation problem that you are facing I think through the forest relationships especially on the romantic ones are going to be difficultthe void in my life if I go to actually answer that question honestly it's PCR I feel like I am really searching to be peaceful in whatever the circumstances because of the more I see I really have very little control over what happened I try to be in control of things I find it very very hard on Saturdays and Sundays honestly I don't have aSunday my life because I work whenever there is a day to work that has made work all the time so now it is I think of Saturdays and Sundays a weekend but have now put into my life but see two years ago I didn't even know what is added incentive stock in transit dates with someone I would call would say like you know I want to free on this data be like listen don't tell me the day tell me the date because I want to know payment found that point Soya this is not been a concept for me thatbut if you are saying pieces or to search for what is keeping away from it is it that has a lot of Kariyo that you think of a Gaya won't be very professional I want to perform really well informed camera what to do when my career is that what takes away from your please perception of what if we reach there will be happy and in the pursuit of that of course the ten thousand things can go wrong in the processpeople say that I wish everyone becomes rich and famous to understand that that's not where the pieces whatever I have been lucky enough to get in my life I think I did that adds to the craziness that makes it even more difficult it doesn't actually help in getting you closer to being peaceful but you do you think you are one of the more peaceful people from the industryjob you know it's like I really don't know if your peaceful but but you are a very good read of vibesthink I have I don't have my Gods of anymore and that is because I don't releasing this you need is the lockdown I don't know it's been such a reality check of what we actually need in our lives and how many things we actually have in in the pace of life that we I don't know about you but I believe the very crazy place where are you I am trying to 10 things in a day like they are you doing an interview with you but not say if this was toriko would've had your interview and some 10 other things to doI can't even peacefully 2020 inter because I am doing so many things and I had gotten used to living like that are you working towards you know I feel like a the lockdown was a big made me realise that I sleep well when I have a good day at work so I think now I'm looking at each day I am not looking at that I don't understand this 10 Indira Nagar Jinda hoga to matlab Dekha jaegabut I'm having said that for me now everyday is important I don't want to I want to be aware of everyday I want to be with me when I'm with you want to be with you I don't want to be like thinking about a real life mein problem chal raha hai I want to be with you and I want to like what about the exchange of ideas and thoughts or whatever you doing please do that In all honestywomen who I am I am 27 and 30shaadi ke bare mein Tota Bole Ki Shaadi pressure but this generation to do itthe sense that they are being there doing it because more like It's the time to do it if you give them their way did not choose it would you choose I am just going with the flow I think you should marry when you find a person to marry you feel you want to live with a person and you feel like your life is not nice and fun anymore alone and this person is the person is in this in your life you feel good about your life then that person should be a in add value to your life so you should get marriedOdia marriage arrive on heavy question whether we like it or not and we are kind of the victim of our own patterns in our field relationships if we have many in my casegetting out of that pattern was very important part of human like you make the same mistake and toxic Apple I think I met some really amazing people and I still wish them well and not like this because I am being politically correct I don't hate people hate anyone on that list I hate them that strongI don't know I didn't make me feel like it's not know the very strong what to use for anyone but some people deserve it why people do that in the two very consciously lekin exactly decepticon I have a newso do you think that you should date someone really long before settling down with them or you should live in with them or should travel with them before actually getting married to them is a travel with them I think it's really Joshua everyone might not want to live in Forex eyes reasons in I feel like in India is also like not not for everyone does a great but for people who can't do that I think travelling is the nextwhat do you look for in an ideal partner I think you should not have to walk on eggshells to be with them you should not have to stress your day to day life is when your day to day life is a stress because of your partner I don't think those relationships last day at some even if they are even if you really get along with them even if they are you have this strange soul connection with them even if you think that Vinay withStatic and you feel on top of the world but if your day-to-day life is difficult that's not the kind of life one can continue living you you get tired of that social media somewhere someone said that good chemistry doesn't necessarily mean compatibility are you can feel Fireworks with some person and it will not it was illegal to like a very Messy relationshipsold the idea of Asansol to me also had the idea of a perfect romance and I see liked that has ruined a lot of life you still believe in perfect romance with the right person it it might not be the first the unit of a girl you me but is possible acinta now now that my parents have a Romance which which I can't believe exist but that should I think of less than they will really be been so wide elastic is made my life miserabletruly hard to find a partner because they've said so high I want to know about this hai Google like because I don't know generation problem will be phasing out is it in individual problem but I think I'm a generation found it much easier to put the other person before you don't see that in today's generation selfish but I think lovefriendships forget a relationship and talking but in general friendship you think about your friend before you think about yourself it's not something you a projection is montague trying to prove the world Kiya itna time Sanu main uske bare mein Sochta Hun Main Apne bare mein nahin sochana about relationships friendships are about before love because I don't know if it's very badly been used so that or milogi ISRObracing care for just like that small things which really matter I think those things make an actual relationship in love languagesyou are like that often like writers poets Dale setting thought Lakshmi Express a lot and that's why they say that the poets writers and and even the other way even guys a lot of guys look for verbal Babli great partners III is like quality time where like that it was a long way to spend time but I don't want anyI like to be like physically around the person hovering around for no reason I don't need to talk to the person or interact with the person I like the present this material love like I went there and it's just have some people will they know how to express love by giving some expensive gifts for that just how they were brought up They brought a problem being given expensive gifts sono I had like this one at a friend of mine had told me that a lot of guys want to date her because she's an actor and even be able to say that I am a girlfriend so I have you sense that in your world people driving you know I think I have I can really give this I don't get away from I want tono I don't but I don't have I don't know why do you think it can be toldsomething you can tell anyone is it your interested so you reach out to the person on your into water when you know the Vibe yeah just creepynot only was roam around today not bothered 990 wearing masks writing without so saves a lot of getting ready time but we're just always be presentable is is exhausting and always look like that you don't wake up looking like that and they say hi expectation out of you at any given point of time likesure if you're having a bad day your sick or just going to something really traumatizing that will not stop anyone from coming in asking for selfie we will have to apply to crispy don't know that you are going to that and they Don't Really Care also you work like both in Bollywood and you worked in the south what is the cultural difference between like South Indian restaurant in Delhi what do you feel what's the difference between the people I know you find and compare them every because I think every why peopledifferent but I feel like I'm sure in the Hindi film industry Asin people being a lot more than the rock is there but it's not so much into your face together and it's all very chill I think there's a little more consciousness of Hierarchy in the south which is the way they function Industries Bina long have you face successany point in whole career but did you notice I think that everywhere in our country probably win in the world but you like days after your fully established at what happens if u no no no but it it as a girl I think these things really matter in something reallydifficult to wear and practically you imagine that they want to put the lady first but it doesn't happen when I think that it is also something like this girls often don't ask for life things Samne sefriend and that's tragic you are I think for women who have been able to put your foot down it always does raffle of you brothers and but I think this is the way to do it so I grew up only with girls like it was just stores around me and a big part of life just thought process growing our guide to make a lot of mistakes growing upnutri gurl something that you would treat a guy friend which is not correct it into slapping and things like that a way that they brought up around other guys if you need a system that will tell you ok no read them and that's the Teenage version of the preteen version of it but even when our starting business to my sister's got together the name is $1 Tony OK good you doing business but no this thing and they explain this whole asking concept me that womenmite often not ask for a raise the thing they deserve or in the next opportunity that I want busy so sometimes as a male boss you supposed to look out for these things that actually win games in advice like on our company has 60% dish female workforce and they really there like the stars of our organisation but I just like more Indian business + India in general needs to change this listing is presented The Subtlefeel is I think if you really want eradicate this problem we need to start looking at men and women As human beings I think be largely as a country have that problem we don't look at people as human beings and as as living creatures Who need to be respected we have respect for animals and human being that the onlymy body and a woman's body but people located one small difference which is probably one percent of a whole existence as like a 50s 60% greeted with the next question on ask you when you how is right now and I'm seeing like welcome to my spirituality around me like you can't promise in the frame but there's like to use spiritual presence in the house so I know that you been to youXUV500 meditation and yoga that was getting you more of the peace in life no I don't think you can get you peaceful peace is a very young you know I think till we as humans in individuals don't take into our own hands and we keep believing this and that an exterior forces and includes your the more you try to bring in things to bring you please it just doesn't happen something you have to do for yourselfyou can view bin on front of the camera while longer than I have just been doing this for Expo 5 years of my life I've reached a stage where I am going up again and I wake up every I don't know whether this is because of lockdown know what that I wake up everyday with this is a sense of life where is my life queen of this is great and working hard I know what I am doing but where is always going ignitable existentialism question boxexistentialism often a spiritual practice that's what all the yoga schools Patrol school teacher that everyone has this void of not knowing the internal up after the carrier assorted tune ok my career was done now that I know that is going well but that you still feel empty beyond the point is that thing concert of you need to come written permission and realise that not it should you still have that you wake up with exist and shall questions wale where is why am I doing this by working so hard I used to ask that a lot in fact that it's like when I sorry journalling12 is the first question that I wrote down like who am I was the first question if you really want to answer that question is the unit is it even trying when you when you try I think the biggest problem is we try to hard enough sleep peace what happens when you tell you just need to go through ityou know you can not the more you push things the more for the review the get from you and I think for me that's my answer to what happens after you professionally researched way you want to reach in special I want I would like to ask you what do you think what is fame done for you what has what changes as a bot in your life or need in life is that I want money to be used to create change like that's what I'm working the words and famousstep towards that money but it's like the same thing to say that it's taken me a lot of personal space over I can't just go for walks and all that any more like know that who I really am I want to wear shorts in my house in shortscall episode 1327 gym shorts Anil is a little off for the Bilaspur judgemental people but lately I have appeared on relation to the same I really enjoyed it does and sometimes I think that why why my toesI will have a strong sense of this thing that anything to create is not your own everything works for you especially if you write if you think of even businesses ideas of business account on how the help of a it's so weird and and then after brain Hospital booking realise that often if you are spiritually align the pop happened why more on that would have noticed in my life was like the more I got into my meditations the more I got into my sense of Faithcreativity expanded a lot like if I think only one video for weak students in next 5 years not a that's not a part of being at the process that there is some higher power than a question the lord the people on the podcast people like yourself people like Amish Tripathi people like this business man army people I have done the what happens in your body when you are going into like combat and all of them had the same every field as an external force acting to US you Prateek kuhadhero baby Hindi single and I like it of a song when you listen to it you know that there's something different about the guys music and creating wealthwhat you think you are today is what you have read in a marked and how much is something that you experienced and discovered on your own not something you grade or something you when exposed to nice equal 5050 light and if you could point out something that you've experienced not something you've read what would that be I feel like when you take action that told doing that action will teach you a lot more about life like for withgreat relationship and boat was probably know that and then Gionee just broke down what a good relationship but if a bad relationship comes alive even be surprised will be like Kya Ho Gaya despite knowing everything about good relationship actually get the action that teaches you weigh more relationmy brain is actually no use or even if it could even be things like that I know your spiritual person and not just the way you treat everyone around you can you a good person feel the difference between say you and other film stars that I would like spoken to another huge difference and you your heart know that you are supposed to send out loud and treat people well but somewhere in your heart does a human element that salhesh to people you're talking aboutwriting the least we can do to ourselves is Qatar sell some slack pricing curve but for me I think I've been very harsh on myself and I think that's one of the biggest principles of yoga f killed trying to what it taught me more than just putting my body into different postures is that is a himself to yourself because no what we do itdoing to ourselves is actually what a projecting order of the people we cannot love ourselves we cannot love anyone else are you know how to do it yourself to people interactive because you think it carry to main dusre ko yah Sahi tarikastarts with u i have if I have learnt anything from my Yoga practice it is in a yoga posture if you cannot stress enough I cannot touch my to I can touch machine but if I want to force and touch my to that is that's being asked yourself you will breathe into reaching your toe in what way are you have to yourself I love working at a fast Pace and sometimes I think that physically gets over living for mebut I still like it doesn't matter drink too much coffee is is do your thing because I like it I like it but it also detrimental and its its cause any harm physically and mentally emotionally as well because it's all in tune right so there was a face that I was I literally came to him that and I had I was always respect of the motions and nothing to offer to cry outhan han left me with the exhausted myself that should not happened why do you think that's why the world is given you so much also it is a lot of people who would love to be where you are in life that the reason given and not the people that is the problem if you don't do it also you don't get what you get is this process of trying to strike a balance of cost to simplyyou can't run a marathon everyday you know it has to be run the marathon and take a break which is your life that you think you are you are very disciplined I am very I really go with my heart it sometimes it's so impulse waiting so sagittarian any whichmake me do the sum so impulsive like I will just jump into doing something I'll be late by 2 into this but in most to make good decisions in some also my very very bad decisions have been impressive but I still choose that route execution action based person when is to experience because I was reading a lot and I was trying to search this something outside that would help me start my life aboutbegin to self help other point but I realise that you know what is only one thing that I need and that is myself to sort me out and said when you can't be there for yourself with more about you it's really not about anything external I stop searching for coronavirusbefore I got a very strong fever very high fever I was working out and I did my shoot I came back to my room land of with high temperature and I was like we go again because I want to my parents so I kind of knew that I was in trouble I woke up in the morning my temperature was not going down and oxygen was no not surprising then I havehow to release thanks my producer his name is Pradeep he is a producer for a website and doing for han to the Telugu web portal and he literally like Rashmi in the hospital in 10 minutes and then there was a bunch of doctors in you know medical staff that really give me the top notch treatment that I needed for five days that hospital Continental hospitals in Hyderabad and95 days according to the hospital Dena usko in team state Quarantine for as long as I have to and I think it was really scary cause I've never been hospitalized before when I went through trouble breathing yes I wasn't sure the funny part is I was in realising and having this problem was getting very tired 3-4 days prior to that I was shooting also getting that now let you know that also workingjust died in to 48 hours my logical explanation To Aisa but yeah I was experiencing that but I was initialised in public at the stage where a lot of it arrived and there is someone who trains and also be used to Physical pain Ham bardas kar sakte to think normal body a card in men's body ache taking like massage in between shots at that muchanother name for the other gift kar liya hai kar liya tour was like that the problem but Yadav Eye Hospital joining was that when you realise that you are alone in you know in in life unfortunately minut Mein very big things are happening life because my parents actually flew down to Hyderabad from Mumbai to meet my parents had issues and I have to mention this because I feel like my life O my achievements are incomplete without their constant supportand I think the reason I have achieved anything that I have is largely due to my parents did you question but did you like think about death because it's not is not unheard of that people and Mike my case was not as simple I did have severe symptoms sore and its its and open thing and now I am constantly hearing of cases ofwhat is possible what do you learn from it give what is really what you really want in life time and effort after that face that you know if I am not enjoying this conversation public tell your face that listen or not liking and loving it Aisi Ranveer can we do this can we have a longer interview family having funand I'm really thankful to you actually get me on a podcast because I think I'm I also feel so much like myself while I am here and I can really talk stuff that I phone the believe what you think about like other than like films what goes on in your head like about life about I know I know you are very motivated person I am sure you think what is auditing for your next project on excel skills I want to work with kids to I don't know I don't know how I will to thedeep rooted Desire that I have to verbalize having kids in the future I am a kid I get to thatit's like you have to dissolve yourself you don't exist and do not leave I cannot live without what I do so I am definitely would have to balance the two different pressures on actors and actresses like I feel even if you're on your desk but I mean you have like this because of like to show you the actors do rifle is much more pressure on your about makeuphello 15 volt wala what you are something funny right after I got out of Corona I was some heavy should medication and have people call me and say Hero you looking at fat in your pictureswhen can I find it really funny I was here was really I think is very humid when I heard that hold that also the downside of Fame people don't understand to scrutinized what's the difference in the pressure of the male actors I think there was but isn't that much money isthe kind of money that riding on them sometimes women really like your web page check is not the same as them but we don't realise and have some somebody your colleagues who your mind the one film doesn't do well the brickbats they get for that one film bombing is nothing close to what happens to us what happened the market value the pressure or having to perform to create better content the next time around actor BD actors also have only so much control over contentyou can you make YouTube content you have full control over what goes out as an actor I have only so much control and that will that equation will never change because I can only comment perform I can give my inputs I can say don't like this I like this I wanted this way change it I can see all that I have that right but the final execution because there are 24 crafts working on it aapke Hath Mein Nahin Hotafloppy that was not the case because there are so many other people working on this and when that happens to them it Hath its I don't want to be in the people going to becausewe are labours in really good clothes is a very labour labour stop wework physically very very heart it requires it was physically emotionally mentally there is unlike any other job like Mondays only care about how I look but you have to look right after feel right and I think right so it's like having a drunken drink bottle of wine and then try to perform you why did remember dialogues I am going to have toact like I am done with actresses always prefer a spouse from outside the film industry is logically why do they say that if your spouse also does the same thing then your life becomes only about that there is no other perspective in your life is my opinion this could be the scoreI think if I'm doing this in my partner also doing this they are only talking about this is the third element to an if you like to have a Holistic life is important to have another perspective in as much detail as you can can you describe your dream man physically mentally spiritually whatever it ok to the person a lot about anyI should have fun I should not feel judged by line with that person you think with your work withok immediately formula opinion so and someone who self made I think that really matters why does that matter I am self made I think somewhere I that's one thing I would like in common cause I feel like you're value every penny also the kind of values and wanted my future kids or like my family that would be my family would be someone who really understands that you have to work for everything and doesn't come easy also the journey ofself made at the whole layout your personality to go through so much sheet with people who are not self made from your own industry would definitely come in true influence or the n word write you send the difference in personality be and what is reported as there is still thereThe Other problems are different than say someone who is not from the industry but yes there is innate sense of surety which comes with the fact that somewhere deep rooted security that you have that your from here so it was going to be easier to get your way around someone who is from outside will still what if my opportunity is not with me and I seem that seen in some really bigsuccessful actors were self made and not from the film industry experience that in security and it's surprising and sometimes they are so they do that doing so well with the sense of insecurity doesn't leave them I think also good because a creative person that sometimes use you so if they enable the channel is that well you know that does some good people happyso I don't think they would actually if I would be honest and I think it it comes to the fact that if you are happy and content it does bring a little bit of you become complacent because happiness does bring that that that the element in everyone's going for the next thing in the only even if you are not going for the next thing we cannot be happy be driven and the drive comes from a little bit ofsatisfaction to request the satisfaction has to be used well if it's not use well then is it ok to board otherwise it could do you think of your life at 40 I don't actually don't feel like I thought too much about my life when I will be 30 like thatstill feel I'm actually the same I thought I'll be doing a painting that I have kids and have a family would have given up acting taken Sunny Deol add add set but I think add very wrong section of what set will be in my life right now on starting and that's so unlike what I thought I will be when I was 20to Fir no idea 40 people who want to be in your placepeople from my fraternity people who are working I don't of the jealous it's time to say but would be have that thing you do want to pull you down not what I think possibly the court that I guess it doesn't come to me I don't leave experience it first and probably in their head resumeyou ask me about him that's one toxic aspect of my life I don't enjoy that I sense a lot of jealousy are only a small bite of from multiple things like from both I think you have that that it should going well like thisas well as you do but they put like 10% of the US and you know I hate seeing this but it one bad aspect of Indian society was to Amish Tripathi to his job is to study Indian history and people think that what were the historian to study History but why do this is storing the supposed to be the predictors of the future is to understand patterns to be able to say that this was likely would happen to be in detail and why whypossible why did India get taken over by our pins and wires India got invited so much that even back thencoming to a topic Laga Ayurveda I know you are into a break time and it's been a huge part of my life in the past one year and have incorporated largely in my IT serve with my diet and lifestyle and I feel you changed after having incorporated that and that such ancient wisdom which we take an extremely light yet the generation and I really and in fact I try to speak about that every platform I get the opportunity to because I feel like our generation is the genrethat needs it so much more than ever read balance meaning that so badly and we need to like change your lifestyle I think our lifestyles quite toxic for us to view changed like what we dropped from your life to choose slowly slowly live and sound again this Singh sound release small but because a lot of stress in your lifeblasting a big change and it was oil pulling which is another ancient Ayurvedic practice fit Tuber sorry YouTube fit Tuber help YouTube and that it could see his contentshow me Singh say we can do that make our life so much betteryour 89 born social media in 2016 17 years old I was like around 1413 but if you are a nine-year-old is given Facebook and is at your whole existence becomes likes comments shares getting validation from the outside world that becomes a Reality That would cause the mental health issues which is why you can I do really try promoting I read that I promoting meditation not everyone Lafzon to this is put that tag ofok this is just some Old School Chale Ham to cool for this without experiencing it doesn't feel like even though I don't vegetarian about two years back and I was that there will be short and therefore be measured sem 2 unit Punjabi redit didn't change you temperamentally it it removed all the aggression and what is it was the outside world is a direction toward yourself like you felt the same when you are good I am just what what what happened to the angleaggression its primary and but also I feel like the only only negative part that I felt with the switch power bi I think I should talk about his experience shall not something that I have read is that I think the job I do I need a vacation but determination change I did feel like I couldn't go aggressive but I am trying to find a way around now because I feeleverybody is unique and I respect that I feel like my parents need to respect kids when they say ki mujhe ulti Yari ko dudh Nahin Pina because they can't all African therein tolerant to another country you've always been like enovia been given food like as a part of a culture thatI think come that awareness is come to me in this pass to you have a sense of competition in the worldKarma for show I don't understand the concept of rivers why don't have an opinion on it but then if I forgot to answer that question I feel like you sometimes why do we feel like we also connected to someone who just might be something by Amy brown to those people and sometimes you have to is very strange conversations with strangers virus a wide range of blood this out and I feel like that somewhere has to do something with me but I guess so I guess that is inactual thing I don't have the time to weekly Pro when is it time to have not not yet but a lot of things are not still exist I think I think we as a nation have been very spiritual and a lot of our findings are based on spirituality and we really like look down upon that I think we need to take a lot more serious than we do as you grow and what is spirituality for youfor me it's just a few basic factors the top with every Lies over time is meditation and my patients a huge part of spirituality intermittent fasting words giving up a break to our body because of the fast meditation is like that for the minds of mineral resources and must be some reason that all the CEO of the world and all but when you go deeper into the world of medication you realise the intellectual benefits the physical benefits but also The SpiritualI feel like along with your career this is parallel path for running with the birth of Karma and your job is constantly be a good person be very honest with your work meditate all these things advance you on that but also the way we were hit the in the same way that if you have a hit film you get even more opportunity like tomorrow because you've already proven yourself and the game works in the same way it does believe the world of spiritual leaders believe in the concept of rebirthat the end of life depending on how much accumulated how much you can life in a better existence or over existing at some point you work your way up to such a better existence that you get what they call Mukti enlightenment of Buddha 121 Mahaveer went to the Saints go through but long very long path and a part of that long but of Karma is your how how how generous you are from your heart check if you if your indulgenceis Rakhi coming to create with emotion are you just giving out for charity for the sake of that if you are treating someone while treating them well you from your heart or you just that time show the world that all these things also natak and Derma people often think it's just the actions of your work it's also a very deep spiritual level is also your thoughts images thoughts of Karma if you are sitting here and I know your good person I can sense the wave you have right no you are genuinely like listening and you're enjoying this conversation between your head thoughtsthis conversation is small level of aggression towards any thoughts may hold good or bad for a very deep spiritual understanding of spirituality and business are the only two kinds of books I read only read these things and all the books I the same things again and again if you say one thing I mean I know it's very hard to verbalize what meditation is because it's not really something one can worktransaxle on it but what do you think you do when you made it so the physical love you focus on one thing that you like the initial focus on the only update of auxin all the sounds around your focus on one Mantra it for the logical that we focus on one thing that the path but in actuality what do you do so for example right now we're doing this podcast you are very cons of a mic in front of you are the causes of Rajas recording records of me talking to you and you also thinking OK I will talk toSandeep after this in the mother interview these thoughts on your head even if your focusing on me that in addition we focus on one thing but through that one thing also focusing on what we call omnipresence offensive ke god is omnipresent of the universe is everywhere around us you go to the moon is the same universe is the one on the earth you go to Bihar is the same Universe has won in Maharashtra so that thing that way power I don't believe in God but I believe in a higher powereveryone around us in meditation to the path of focusing on that one Mantra of that one your own breath you are getting Re connected to that one thing we are not focusing on these multiple aspects of the one thing and focusing on it as a whole so that's the heavy explanation of a welcome to what I don't feel like that anything right or wrong is like everyone has a different experience while they walk the path oflife and everyone's in individual experience is right causes their experience for me when it comes to quality and I have invited half as much as you have to actually make a comment on it but what I think and what I think I understand of it is to be in a state where there is nothing was and that'sof being meditative because while there is a constant thing of thoughts going on it doesn't give a reminder break only when we are not thinking but we are in the moment is when we a meditative so for me even this interview is meditative while I was in this interview with you I was actually not focusing on the cameraman or on my next interview but I was actually focusing on you because to me being in the momentimportant I started to do is if I intend on increasing spirituality in my life I need to bring it in every as you will realise I hope you will know about you don't you think that everything alsothat would be seeking right but I think the the lesson we try I think we are likely to get there is a lot more like asking less but I do believe in gratitude rising that come to me a lot more during this entire coronavirus is because I think we have not thank god I haven't thank people were available to me in my life and now we make a very conscious and almost like a very proactive effort in thanking people because I feel likeI can't do most things I do without the help of a lot of people think that you do something that I have really realise that it is very important and it's not about the other person's about yourself what do you prefer for this day be shortercutting De De make my day better things I dont think I have I don't ask to big things because I think I have been gifted that by the owner was a lot before after yoghurt at the small things which seem small this land of your fever in in your careerwhy is the universe acting through in this way what your purpose like and for the tree outside has a purpose I might have a purpose so I don't know what the purpose is so I hope it's to make people laugh and smile and give great podcast and also to make me feel fantastic I am not much different nowand my final question to you is that if you had to just give me a life you to condenser down to like three learnings what would you share with the world there is no time right time for something that right time is nowtry too hard and on and every moment to be happy whatever I could be something small do that small thing that makes you happy not the bigger things because those things seldom in your hands so the small things that make you happy what would you like to tell your future husband watching the spotto make this quick thank you be a lot of fun and funtake this quick thank you ki be a lot of fun and fun it as effective as my very big coffee

sometimes That Got Away and and that reminds you how are you ask a girl and a cucumber and keeps you grounded and also helps to empathize with people more because if you ever felt that way and sometimes we were young person comes after me to Jaipur stressed out there is no such thing as stress that's not true and so I find the when I feel stressed of fearful anxiousexplore with a little deeper so that next time someone said that to me I can actually see your empathy and compassion for them because I know how it feels Jay Shetty my brother and on having you won the Ranveer showso much that people like myself motivations because all of the content is picked up from you firstly congratulations on your book it come out it become a best seller and secondary thank you man like you I don't show you know the value you spell out from not 100% sure you know the magnitude of the value used in the world of watching you and saying are you doing that it's really inspiring and so I am gratefulthis is the it is my honour and Vicky doing what you are doing you are having such a big impact yourself and I am glad that we're getting to do something together with an event was likewise brother I am sure if this whole pandemic situation hadn't happened you have probably been in India this point definitely with which is going to be a theme on the spot cause a lot of Indian fans of your was watching this the big question to you is what is this country and thisHeritage giving you that you carry through into your career and your work into the Jay Shetty who is staying in Los Angeles and talking to the kardashians and athletes what is Indian culture given that person Indian my father was born in Pune that originate from Mangalore and my mother was actually born in Yemen wishes Gujarati so that the bigger trafficand Swami India has given me every 20 wisdom that I find share that I am trying to extend out the world all comes on the text India so whether it's the bhagavad-gita whether it's the vendors that any of those amazing literatures and I think well so that incredible understanding of growing up in Indian home with good hospitality a good values are the ability to welcome otherslife 22127 10 to 12 you have a positive impact on others really I would say that everything that I am doing is fuelled by the incredible how to in love that I receive from India India through which book Sintex doors to the people that I want to ask you a lot more about the books but I got to know about your time spent in Indian Ashram as a monk how did you land up in that specific Ashram and where was itI was studying in London and I will be interested by the force motivational Chinese people went from nothing to something and was in the material 6s I was impressed by I was impressed by people with sacrificed with broken through depression who really worked on themselves and so I was reading biographies and autobiographies and I would go in here people speak because I was really inspired by listening to amazing people with great Insightthis month speak and write over an Alliance Monk you want to go to market strategy and I want to long anyway because I tell my friends and I know you are you dear tag name is bigger biceps so I thought I thought the team that I told my friend sorry that I will only go if you want to have a drink of to it and I agree with me and so we went to this event is monks week and The Monk was from India in Tamil gauranga Dasventure it had given up his degree to become a month and so I draw you either have to be really crazy or really small because why would you do that why would you give up your degree it to become a monk and really interested by his sacrifice and and his choice and so I started asking questions and spending time with them and at the time he was starting a new project which was to have a outside Mumbai in abelieve it's in the vicinity of Palghar areacode water and this new project was to provide villages with a proper functioning village a sustainable community and a livelihood Venturi give back to the community to teach people there about business agriculture tree How the make the most of their lives and you're being constructed by month and so I go completely blown away by the fact that these months we knowgoing Deep and doing meditation also serving in helping the world and I thought to myself that how beautiful is that that you can do but you can take care of your mind and take care of your dinner life with the uterus if I make a difference in the world and that's why I ended up in the monastery and that aashram because I so this perfect balance of self-care and self mastery balance with the service and philanthropy and giving that the worldbeautiful Jay I have to ask you this one question I have always thought about when I watched your content which is that it comes out of an extremely deep place and often if a human being has the ability to think that deep or right that deep its its kind of almost always the case where a human beings also had the time of a dark past so has your pass had any darkness in 1 lakh you gone through I am sure you havewhat some baggage in the past possible if you've let go of it now through all the meditation you do the work you do this content cause the content creator but I want I want to take you like wave before you became a content creator was there any like darkness in your life lessons from a very early on I remember being bullied at school and I was around around like 56 years old when I started to get bullied and I used it because I was overand I was one of the few Indian people in my class I think in my whole school at 56 is always 13 Indian people may be made Avengers 4 August and so I will Bully for being overweight for being in the end and people used to sing Indian people in my area I was overweight drawing up as a child would be any other way I look at my weight and I was definitely difficult to go toSyndicate you don't understand any of that time lied to us I was born with this weekend and discoloration I don't I don't know if you are happy with what are you have and so that was definitely tough and then even in my teenagers I started to get involved in the wrong suppose because I never felt I really had like an older brother figure and the oldest absister I didn't really have any one all that was dying me your helping your supporting me and why they flee from the I got involved in the wrong circuits and some the wrong circles ended up in getting involved in everything from drugs through to fight send and that's what if scenario does job because I would be a good person and I never wanted to be entered in any one of the drug journey of that stuff it's not really my natural inclinationand so can you find yourself in those places and you don't know what happening next place and and beyond all of that in the dark is thing was just that I constantly feel like no one really understood my decision and I think for older was not just for me I think the darkest place to live is where you feel people their understanding and managing a lot of peoplemental health challenges for depression and stress for fresher it is IPL no one understand and and the truth is that does a sometimes the most powerful moments of my life because it when people don't understand you that you try to take the time to really try and understand yourself and that was so much strength comes from is understanding yourself in taking the time to validate yourself 100% mannow he said that you know the books from India inspire you one of the concepts are effective from those books it kind of like a deep concept but it basically said that the rewards that you receive in life are equally a result of your hard work but also your karma how good you been as a personal on a few minutes but not truthful you when you have broken out as a content creator all over the world and has a lot of other people who are trying to doare you doing they have been tons of the people I want to ask you from this perspective of the learning what have you done correct in life have you been guided by the right people have you constantly kind of held onto your own ideal your own ethics that was gone write five according to your attention I want you want to do good for others and services and support others even when I started reading contentSiri over na Dekhe mamma my my intention was who is to serve in to help others mind tension was never motivated by big result so anything that happened in my life today I never had happened and I never even believe that the goal of the is the reason I was doing the reason I was doing it was I believe that I incorporate this incredible wisdom and I wanted to share it was it and so I think sometimes our intention getsassumption really our intention is eager driven or sometimes it's a money driven or something with results driven and not everything that you can have money you can be famous it to be successful but if that is your reason for doing that is your intention to do in a want satisfy you even if you get there and I actually if you do it for a deeper reason you're probably get the faster and you will be happier when you actually receive it and so wereI work on this everyday it's not that I am asking day Everyday I'm working on my intention to be of service to his wanted help that one thing the second thing I'd say is that I'm all the best features and meant was in my life because in the guys that had in my life they would always reminded me of how far I have to go so I'm not surrounded by St Paul and surrounded by people will say this is great but it is your meditation on this is greatbut how much have you will overcome you eager to the check in a positive way they encourage me give me how to Dekho so humble near the same time and I think that having people like that in your life to know your passion and your purpose but they also had to bring your greatest potential is really important and other thing I'd say is that I have really worked on my craft I think people forget the year I was fortunate enough to go to public speaking school from ageage 18 because my parents post me 7 years of public speaking training from the age of 18 228 I gave lectures and causes for 3 hours a day when I had your followers m80 money and had no online following is doing it because I loved it and I didn't even know that any one and onlyyou are applying in your life so sometimes we will try and share ideas that we have an experienced and informative Lisbon to try and share ideas that I am practicing in experimenting in trying to learn and write anything that these things that I haven't mastered the things I'm constantly working on the rising they sometimes forgotten when people see the last four years we don't look at the last 15 years and a new missile on the journeyaccording to you is your life easy or difficult todayI would say my life is the purpose for which has but elements so so what I mean by that is my life is easy because I know what I want to do what I stand for Innova I believe in it is difficult to put in work I have to be organised have to live with disciplined life with discipline funnily enough actually makes life easier to people think this discipline is difficultdiscipline is that life becomes easier and waking up everyday meditating going to the gym is difficult it difficult to assess its it challenging but the result if there is life becomes easier said that and dedicated to difficult discipline but because it's purposeful and has meaning become makes life easier if the answer your questiondoes it does what am I am asking this for selfish reasons because I I I have I have difficulties even today you know with with so many blessings around me established businesses that are days where are you wake up not feeling completely motivated / not feeling completely would I am just asking you this kind of a younger brotherI like you so much to do in the support I need your own all of that and and what I say to people is that training your mind and your body is not about never feeling that way again it's not that one day that what happened if they are you let it a factual less time so in the past you and me maybe even have when bad things happen you be sent to the butterflyduring the week and then in a year from now using it for one day and year from now you will feel the stress and pressure and the less you but the problem is that when yougold that I should become in future perfect everyday that go to switch on pressure and stress in your life and I am with you like as saying thatand also helps to emphasize with people more because if you never felt that way and sometimes we were young person comes after they are too stressed out there is no such thing is that true and so I find that when I so stressed of fearful anxious iexplorer a little deeper so that next time someone said that to me I can actually see your empathy and compassion for them because I know how it feels and actuallyif you're going through pain is the best thing for content creator because that's how you should be emphasized with people if you don't know the truth and then you can never let anyone ask you a question now where do you see Jay Shetty at age 80 and alive that thing I would like to see myself in the life and I would hope thatI was truly been able to serve and support the leaders of the next generation so I truly believe that I am not the smartest person in the world and I'm not going to invent everything that needed in the world that I can be someone who is behind those people and support the meaning correct them and guide the mind and keep finding their intention with the winner will be migratedbring that if if we can discover the talent of this world and encourage those people to become leaders to rebuild adjust world a collaborative world a world where humans recognise their similarities more than the differences but celebrate the differences Tumi Tumi if we can find the leaders and invest in them and Naresh comment and support the men serve themamazing change in the world it I hope that should I get to do and I hope that I am surrounded by lots of people want to change the world and in a positive way and that I can be of some used to them are already on that I was reading this book is it called 21 lessons from the 21st Century by yuval Noah and hischapter in the about God and spoke about how the term god is kind of God and negative connotation in the modern-day often because people associate the term God with really radical religious groups that you know will use the term god as to put their own intense ideal out that so first name the what your sense of God that what your definition of it and secondly like how do you think the world is gonna change the solderaction of God going forward questions about hiring for 60 days to Just Married his phenomenal we had we had some really nice conversation of line as well as a big fan of this book and began with him but I think your questionsthen I think he saying is very important to me god is at the very essence of God is the recognition that there is a source and a power and energy that is divine and that something beyond us something beyond the something inside of was and something that connects everything in the universe and start the very essence of that god is what is hatchbackrecognition of the understanding of something beyond the something within us and something around us and to me whether you then for specific people giving Garden name given that those beautiful things I should we believe that god is the supreme personality and and is someone the you can have your relationship with and so I think the to me what do you have a relationship with the universe where you focus on having a relation withif you focus on adding a relationship with a Supreme personality divine source it was a bad relationship it's not about its not by any desired pressure it's not about being scared of God it's not about its about building a relationship with something that is beyond US and I think the reason why the definition of God will change as the world goes onpeople affected by the rules and which lipstick practices that made people lose the essence of what this really was and I think coronavirus in our generation you know I I think we all want to be more spiritual unconscious but we want to do it for my place not just a following rules space and and I also think thatchange because we have to find a HIV you'll need a passport if you look at some of the most successful athletes musicians most accomplished people in the world they haven't paid for spiritual practice so you see that meditation prayer all of these deposits on the most happy and successful people in the world and hopefully the more personal life becomesthe more individual becomes ever become a really beautiful thing and people's lives that's the big hope honestly Like I Remember one of very personal level I had an IOS ka experience with completely changed my definition of God promise 22 is very lucky to have that experience really early in life shifted a lot of things for me and as my career has undergone forward on ACC miracles happen around me thatonly believable when it happens to you and your in my shoes and you see my journey but even today I have like some fantastic do we recruit for a company is an all who may be initially don't have a sense of God and slowly the development and can become the news anchor for them through the own Journeys so that my big hope men like I hope that content creator is a kind of able to put that idea about the not in a forceful way but in exactly the way you did it soquestion I got what I wanted but man I gotta move on to the next big question which is meditation for see what kind of meditation to practice today and what's the end goal of meditation this is a very common question on the Internet like what happens at the end of it visualisation and mantra because I think all of them have different uses inI practice but I will stress pressure any student diary dress work is the best way to heaven immediate response so free job alerts and going on stage in front of thousands of people and feeling a little nervous then I will just Breathe and for cancer 4 Adobe Reader for more than four and how to absolutely set and how to ready to covid-19 time and time again whenever I am in that situation visualisationis is really powerful it can be used for a few things so what are the first things I use visualisation for is if I work with clients with someone is upset about the last thing they said to someone who passed away was no in the life anymore and I can't say what they want to say visualisation is an incredible way to revisit the past and and change how you behave that situationchange your life changes the experience of the memory that's one way using visualisation II by using visualisation is if you think that something difficult if you visualise yourself doing a Overdrive forget it starts becoming easier to visualise use of waking up early visualizers of working out in the morning visualisation of the six pack for bicepsyou start to make a happening your life because everything that you created existed here and the Third way that I use visualisation is obtainable visualise if I'm doing something today live coming on this podcast then what I do something the beginning of the day is a look at my schedule and I visualise what will be my intention when I come to each thing I am doing and shubharambh already prepared the one I come to you my intention is OD setBadi Sundar shampoo that visualisation and a month I am in so many beautiful month resin in the vedic literature Zindagi Ta and I would recommend the people that you find your monthly to find the reformation that becomes your ankle is it really beautiful and for me one of my favourite 17 sharing a lot recently from other point of view is the service sukhino bhavantu Mantra a which is so beautiful because I think the world needs a lot of peaceand and and my favourite affirmation for myself is an exactly where I need to be the reason why I am happy that to myself is because I think he was thinking ahead or behind was thinking I will let were rushing and so it would be too much of that you are I need to do this is what I meant to be right with you right now this is this is where are you remind yourself that the new represent the end of meditation an interesting question ANSwhy I would like to know that is imagine seeing what is the end of eating food what is the and teaching field when when will be a boy you never need it again because we can offer the truth is there is no end to eating food you eat food everyday because it fills you up and nourishes un8x care of your body similar you meditate every day it will give you more clarity of Mind more connection with your soul and most listened to the inventionis no end to meditation like there is no end anything good in life and I think we we sometimes mistake meditation or anything else is having an end but the best things in life we eat everyday we sleep every day in our everyday lives habits for daily life and if you say what is the goal of meditation the goal of meditation is to connectGod in your true self without any other unmotivated uninterrupted the gender the problem right now is that I give this example in the book this is a beautiful beautiful from a former prior and it talks about how when you first come across a mirror if you go to mirror your lost in the basement you see that has not just on it sometimes will be looking at ourselves right now we don't know who we arethe mirror is dusty when you start to clean the mirror that meditation is meditation is cleaning the mirror on stock in the mirror the first thing happens the dust comes in your face when you first of meditating you might even be like got this is so difficult and I can't see anything and I don't understand anything but after cleaning you can see yourself clearly show that is the goal of meditation meditation is the process in a cleansing and healing to introduce yourselfif someone wants to get deeper into meditation in general other than you know just creating a habit and focusing on your breath what you advise that person how do they jump into the advanced meditation my my biggest advice should be and I know that is difficult right now so I appreciated that it's really important to go A1 Dev Retreat or a one-week Retreat and used to dip because we live in is world right now it's like do5 minutes a day do this to 3 minutes a day and even sometimes I recommend people to do things to show an answer to make it easy for them but the truth is let se you like a Gaya a girl like you think about dating them and slept with someone that you just 15 minutes everyday just 15 minutes then everydayamodep you get in a in a consistent theory of times I will say to people instead of trying to do meditation once a week for the whole year during for one week in a fully like in a football and when you do when you feel the benefits like you did in your own expenses you feel the benefit and annual keep it going for 5 minutes a day to the biggest mistake we make is which although one summer 1st year 2 7 days and you feel the benefitexercise I don't want it if you're into that you againpre marriage questions do you believe that men and women have different thought processes or different ways of perceiving the world I I believe that there are definitely masculine and feminine energy and you may find birds in both men and women so which not necessarily that all men think the seminole women think the same but I believe there are more masculine energy santhosham or feminine energy when we all have a mixer bowl of thereducing tab we think about things differently so I think psychology is far more individual then which time think it is your I think and meditation kind of balance is due out in terms of if you have too much more masculine thought process will give you that feminine perspective and wiser was and that women experience I had I think I just developed things like MP3 compassion endurance love emotional expression all these verymain aspects of thought letter a pyramid meditation and before that I had much more masculine kind of thought which are also great bravery determination just strength going for it like taking risks but you only be available balance life when you balance of those two energies inside do you can agree with that I agree with trying to find both of them inside bar specialthey have such powerful uses a different times and actually when you notice them inside yourself you start your pressure on the people what you know I think we all grew up in his mind this negative mindset of light stop being a girl people would say things like that I stop stop being so soft and as a mistake there because when you say that you are not noticing the value of the quality and so when you know his birth in yourselfcelebrate that I will this work the question about marriage is ASM and what do you have to do for your wife like what you have to change about yourself and I know the very broad questions on asking you everything from 0 like do you have to give up on some of your own space I'm sure you give it time to give it energy but what are those things that you only realised as a guy after your married andstandard error of important decision you make in life and anyone is listening watching right now when you making any of these decisions Russian into the matter pressure and don't give them quickly like releasing about the first one is how you feel about yourself that is one of the biggest decisions you make is how you feel about yourself the second most important decision you made is what you do for money the most important decision you make is who you give your loved onegive you loves this question hour and a fourth one is have used the world doesn't not decisions that should be made out of any of the reason of from plasma concentration when you like someone that's the time to really think about right to the beginning and write its own way to narrate to figure out what you can tap to change it is mainly then you have to change something you don't want to change my wife Reddyrdw Sharif anyone followers on Instagram when you United follow on Instagram content and before adding a month ago when we won dating as new and Amy been together for seven years and Nari for 4 years together and we first met and we were attracted to each other we liked each other I was honest with aboutwho I was and what is important to me and life and it is a faster if you don't know who you are and what will be important in life when you never know who is right for you and no one can ever know if their right to eat and I will be honest I said my purpose even at that time I was concentrated acid but this is selfie 4 I want to teach I want to share I want to focus on developing this for my life and this is my number one priorityshe said to me the number one priority was her family her parents and sister she loved the mum and dad in a grandmother it she said that her hot in white and I said I promise you that I will always hope you get there and you promised me the euro is how we get there is a really honest conversation that doesn't mean that is easy but it means that we had a direction from the beginning to now if I have a Priority with myand I couldn't go to her family when she was better than supported me and if I had a big event and she can't come with me because she had family and I respect and love the goal of the relationship was get her closer to her goal and she has make a person am I gonna be traded away goals is to work on each other and so actually know what you're giving up on is your legal and your sensor control that yourelationship because The Eagles as well as she should come with me to this event and see me on stage in Hindi lecture as a blog and understanding the person that lovethat's really has been the guiding force about marriage and that a change dosa check in with Brad Aansu checking with me like my my call is pretty much did the same has changed awards I have to change in the wall with that if I love that's the point and then there were updated asyncwrite space and all of that have stopped again if you have a very clear guiding light everydirection of these things standard used were themselves and then you have to discuss why I was such a rider I Am A terrible you don't even want to try and like I am just telling that's not my strength is not my skill and under which is being honest whether that is the meaning of wooden if she wanted me to but because that have passion that her that her personal and so she is happy to do that and so I think it willin a relationship beginning middle where are you are just be honest about who you are and what you want and that was to be honest work they are and what they want and remember you are just trying to help them get closer to their go it's not about use compromising its one end of happening in relationships is but the men and women of the men and men or women and women having compromises and when you come to mind when you always feel in your heart like or because of themI gave up foggers important to me and that they would a loving relationship and this is something that someone once told me I am still coming to terms with it and I don't know if it's an actual thing but is it true that your growth rate need to match a as a partnership because I mean honestly the blessing and The Curse of a content creation Kariyo is that behind the scenes were keep studying you gotta keep growing working adding things your ownand so it puts you in this way we opposition of you have created your own championship belt and earn it every day you will develop toward that with a lot of load on your relationship and your partner in terms of ok keep up with me so what you think of this whole growth rate theorysweat so much like you like that died on their mum so they need hand how did they need support they need you to guide them and show the way and you after deciding that something you want in life is where you are the child to you did the bearing units of the guide tubebody Chadar which one do you want I want the events that that's thankfully what I have is that carries me and I carry her in which support each other with balance each other with some people want to be the parent the natural the support the provider and don't want to be the child and we have to ask ourselves which one of these is sustainable forests and the fruit is the dinner tired is not a sustainable relationshipeventually someone will get hired in both of you and will feel overwhelmed and just exhausted taking care review and also you might find the you get exhausted taking care of someone out so I I believe that trying to find a partnership for you but Harry and bulbs and support gifts for more sustainability and also requires more work like me and I haven't figured that so many of conversation over the last few yearsand communicate about Expectations and we use it to realise that people are growing in different ways a different time so when I'm really I was more spiritual and today I will say that it is faster to see that means so much to wear on spirituality and and she teaches me and so the point is that you have to recognise as long as a person is growing their growth may not look like your brush that grows may not be the same for example youmigros Mein look like studying Box with a group mein between Charity work and it was great looks different so you can't judge someone's growth based on how your growing and such important I was driven by you may look different when you mentioned spirituality by simple question what is spirituality for human beings what is the spiritual journey what does it mean to be spiritual The Monk definition that was thought to me is thatmeans weather spirit is behind the ritual Subah this way the ritual is done with understanding intention and depth that is done with the deeper sense of understanding the ritual is just the the Puja the Aarti does the ritual is done with the spirit of compassion of devotion that is what spirituality in using these very powerfullpowerful powerful activities of devotion but actually doing the major portion that is spirituality ask you about veganism because of the famous and it's something I've told vegetarian since the last two and a half years I feel like getting deeper into spirituality my body is projected meat and I am Punjabi so a grown up eating more meyou can imagine but just one day I was looking at the chicken breast in an atom I know you know this Nagar happen gradually gave up all kinds of meat over the next year and every state why don't have eggs I do have a Lil bit of milk and I don't know Milke something that I will give up in the long term but vegetarianism is something that gave me a lot of gifts and something I really understood after actually took it up with full force to ask you for your journey in this vegan vegetarian transformationI grew up eating meat is well aradhi Grand vegetarian cuisine vegetarian whole life begins nearly 10 years now maybe something like that arrived I grew up eating me so I am each and everything and I became vegetarian about 15 years old and of choice so he was very simple I would my school journey on the way back from school I would go faster butchers everydayenjoy with Siri animals hanging in the window and when I saw that it was the first time I registered as my call that chicken that having their that's the chicken amazing in my chicken sandwich from McDonald's and around the first American India McDonald's just opened in Bandra and I got a gun to McDonald's and innocent 9 is all that I am over every such a direct link for me and I don't do that anymore15 and easier to do it with someone who was educated how to do in a healthy way and what I am I am not I don't consider myself to be a profound and or a Ambassador I consider myself to be someone is trying to practice set themselves and for me my my recommendations everyone like you like you did for yourself is to do what is right for you at the right timehan to do in a way that healthy and sustainable to the you feel the physical benefits as well as the moral benefits because some people become vegan vegetarian for help in some way for morality and for me is better fit both for me is benefited Moni on Word Level but I really just allow people to come together on time because I grew up eating meat is well so I ordered I don't judge anyone know I don't feel anything negative to was anyoneit's me I think it's a personal choice if you are together in your own time 100% that something I agree with that also I mean me speaking as a former me do if someone told me to give up me that I get back then what I do like doing is sharing on his experiences were felt like I did have a change in my thought process of the way I am I perceive the world and of course my health isI definitely lost some muscle but in retrospect it's a decision I would never change if I ever go back and what it done for you like physically mentally spiritually what's what's that affect the life you yes I stopped me from getting exhausted so that the fluid for bad throat sore throatI still find myself feeling a lot of Nutrition is feeling quite I would get on well more regularly since thankfully by Cynthia gondi gana thankfully no no no experience too much physical else that will break ornamental level I definitely feel lighter in Eiffel Vitaran clearer I have more clarity and more I feel like I have more stillness and less less Tandavaggressive person anywhere but I definitely more even more Kama and spiritually just given me a love for really appreciating animals I mean it's it's so beautiful the so equally this incredible create other creatures and creations and to appreciate them and appreciate the life in them 20 appreciate that source of energy and them that you know that Lie and all thatchicken table days has launched it feels pain feels love feels motherly love with you never if you've never seen carrying front of you never seen a kangaroo baby can you know it is a beautiful to watch that I want you when you deeply look at that you start video creating that there is a beautiful living forces the we have inside versus inthat some gorgeous answer Aam Jay because we are running out of time a good ask you bunch of social media business easy questions but let's begin with you know when you meet people like Kobe Bryant when you meet all these amazing human beings that you've already had on your show me how does it change you and secondly have you seen the world's perception of you changing I thinkchange is me as that I genuinely think the sometimes we often look at anyone who is successful who has achieved something in life we sometimes even numbered list in London I don't know what it's like in India but I remember sometimes our friends never be like like you know made it into a properly or unlucky enough that they used that just got the right introductionyou can find password of like they were there and sometimes we do that about Musicians of whatever may be and from that I've seen people who really sacrifice to relieve work to relieve discipline themselves meditated daily who invested in the shop in the world and answer the weight in fact that it gives me moregives me more confirmation that the work you and I am doing is deeply important and is deeply needed to this all these people who have achieved impact in the world ever done it themselves to meet sister very grounding and humbling feeling that was lucky that we get introduced to these teams in subjects at an early age to give these are the things that these people grounded in themselves andHero I have been given much thought of how it affects people see me because you know for me I will living structure follow my heart intuition life my whole life and I've been really grateful that a lot of these people have been on the show is well then not just people on the show them become friends like their friends and answer for me it's it's a it's it's never been about the the the the the theunder which it with the fact that I want to learn from these people and so I hope that it's I hope that helped people understand that I am a student a student of of life and all these people in the doubt the best in the people take away format to show that even though before amazing that I'm sharing and I'm just always learning that that that to go and so I believe that were people she is my intention I think that's what you are spreading out your spending that studentmentality joy and finally to ask you about the social media game what your intuition about the future of the world of content was that happen in the next 10 to 20 years what are you planning for yourself how do you think someone can grow and secondly just you know what to do when your hacks for growing this fast on social media yes I think the biggest thing we all knownew phones and is going to the new new new apps we will see the rise of Tiktok in our seeing this Awkward Moment weather today figure of whether it can I stay or not and which in the rise of Riyaz on Instagram in universe platforms are formed due to realises if you want to be a content creator don't teach you Zain picky about the platform that help you grow so when IYouTube was the hot and Facebook was considered the not platform but my work on Facebook with them through my YouTube and groom Instagram and so I wasn't a ki about I want to be cool on undergone YouTube I will just like wherever You Feel the Love The Way You Are So you my stuff feeling some love on Tiktok going on Tiktok u i feel the love on Twitter going on Twitter don't think in yourthis is not the cool platform I wanted you on this platform a lot of people at the time were thinking on arrival big on YouTube forget Facebook is a waste of time and uniform mein Facebook on the platform that changed my life and so it really important the beginning to find the phone the works for you and your content and going on the platform and then you'll see the outpouring of the traffic controller your platform Suri so the when my Facebookimprove exponentially the Instagram through YouTube group everything through because of that one powerful growth and so can we spread out to them and we stop making content that doesn't work on any phone because it can deal with all the advice in the beginning when you very less to strike main content that wins on one platform and just colon so what are the strategies to share with you the first religion wisewho is tested lots of different styles of content so you never know what's going to work and even now and it has been experimenting stars show with this new format which is putting money into movies service Ne giving advice to Spider-Man me giving advice to Jennifer Aniston giving advice in this movie format and I didn't want to do somethingthree of them to more of them and the first thing is to be constant experiment in such an experiment a normal like it and then I talk to myself that did you want to do that they fulfill a part of me and if it makes me so happy then I'll keep doing a bit if it's not making me happy are not like the why am I doing that I can't stress this enough to get to know your audience and Yorkif you have a hundred followers and you don't talk to them and you don't message them and you don't read the comments and you'll never know what people are really looking for what they appreciate it and so funny I am on the instrument coronavirus DNA news live with your stocking it's not like missing or something member can do that I am gone insane and applying I am reading people's comments I think that William forward getting to know your audience and thentopics and understanding what you're looking for the one that's been really important is collaborations and support and I think you many people are trying to compete and and I really believe that is far more collaboration and collaboration happens on equal level so when I was growing a lot was growing at the same time series go cost me a Princess who also that three peoplesupport each other we all have features we became friends and Anthony started being especially started around the same time around 3-4 years ago and he just wanted each other in a new so I like in a girl cast is very well and I saw them at night 10000 following 27 followers like that you but we always realise that our strength was in working together and so when you studying Outlook for people that are on yourEach Other rather than competing with each other and with their reach these videos are we will share with us and we all grew at the same time it will important and enter the biggest one is to have to get addicted data you have to look at the data you can't just keep creating and not looking at what time you have to locate a people watching the whole video on the stopping at this point why are there is a company in America are someMighty magiswords this company and he was having a bad day and they had something called the board test bowling test so is there would watch the new video as a team and they would look like thiswe have to get focused on the data and all of this should never become one of you think content creators make 2 mistakes we eat to become selfish over become seller on Myntra seller in just make a new audience lights and you are not no no growing anymore and selfish is where you just might consider you want to watch but no head but still water and that this point in the either and should the real fun think there is someone who looks insideunfollowers David insulation and looks data then tries to be dynamic balance is what creates a concentrated the future but I want to end the podcast by asking your three quickest pieces of advice from the Bhagavad Gita book Renault you mentioned it a lot in your book so I want you have to say about the bhagavad-gita yes I 3 versus what are the betterCaller your own past imperfectly that you follow someone else's fast and I think this verse is the embodiment of the disease of comparison we see in the world today we start chasing something because we see someone anything ok I want that you are you know if I was honest with you bro like I love football and soccer football is my my life I love it if I could be a question about is love thereis very early on that I didn't have the work Cafe on the talent to create a professional level and So being honest with myself is allowed me to create this like they have today prameya keep trying to live in trying to do that you just get lost so that the first piece of advice on the guitar and the second piece of advice which is the famous quotes from the guitar is your mind to the best friend or your worst enemy I think learning to be friend your mind is the most importantlife it is very you want to develop habits whether you want to become successful happy enjoy 4 if you don't have

organs of abusive words we go back in time if they talk about all of these words with such outer beauty even the vagina for instance is known as the Chandan Mahal the clitoris is referred to as the mother nature treat the umbrella of the love of God and so on so I think that the words that you use start today also define your actionsthe moment you stop thinking of that as dirty and bad and abusive you your mind already started to change in the way that you brought something Seema Anand how are youvery good Ranveer how are you I am great this is a dream podcast for me before I talk about via the dream podcast I want to introduce you to my audience so miss Anand is one of the foremost voices the most modern voices in the world of the Kamasutra is one of the world's most renowned author narrative practitioners and mythologies addition the Ranveer showma'am so honestly I feel like the world of the Indian internet especially from a youth standpoint is obsessed with sex and in more Modern Times the concept of nofap and celibacy especially the mail audiences so before we begin talking with those topics and like to ask you how you explain the world of the Kama Sutra in the most simple way how do you explain it to20 year old interestingly I discovered that the Kama Sutra explain it in the shortest possible way is about pleasure not about sex sex is a very physical at that anybody can indulge in the actress sex pleasure is something that only the human mind can actually understand and indulgent letter is a much longer lastingexactly extremely good for you and it is something that it takes you to a whole different height it supposed to elevate you're supposed to make you reach certain height that you can't otherwise great but what what do you mean by height you mean in terms of human experience and I mean literally in terms of human experience I mean in terms of elevating the mind so this is what it was written for WhatsApp and Who is the author of the Kamasutraactually said this in his introduction he said that you get the idea is also as we talk about it for quite how elegant and beautiful and refine this whole world there is nothing like we think of the after sex today and it talks about this refinement and this beauty in such way because in ancient times they believe that everything had to start from the point of physical intimacy so I'm going to give youexample related products played it better everything that every time I came to the Throne they would have a version of the Kama Sutra Commission for the kingdom is not just one Kamasutra 2000 them and each time they had it Commission that believes that if a couple could share really really good mutually pleasurable intimacy that means that the relationship would be stableif the relationship was stable society would be stable society with stable The Kingdom would be stable at the the bigger picture it was believed back in that time that success in any part of your life whether you are a warrior whether you are an economist whether you are a trader whatever it is that you did Sixth Sense in any part of your life depended on your success in your physicalMetLife and eventually if the aim is to reach god all love has to first begin at the physical level before you can start to elevated so I guess that's what I mean when I say that you know it and hence its not about sex because sexy actor sex is on its own it doesn't mean that much it is about pleasure It's about arousal it is bar Desire because of course in ancient times can we believe that the highest form of energyis the sexual energy you are a sports person you know that if you if your there are running out to insert Mata Exercise to get your metabolism going to believe that when you have a row so when your in the state of pleasure and elevating pleasure there is more metabolism in your body than even value exercise because it every part of your body goes into some form of activity your heart rate your breathing your hormones are being secreted everythingand eventually you consider this is where if you if you can read this letter to its final point this is how you can create life only God can create life story of this was considered the highest form of energy because it's that before hence this was an extremely important thing in the time taken by beautiful so from what I understand I do feel that physical pleasure was given a lot of importancebut sex as a concept was just a part of the world called physical pleasure but in saying that how we transitioned into this modern day India we even the active hugging is almost looked down upon by a guy and girl hug each other It considered O my God how you having physical contact with each other how did we transition into this change things we believe thatfuture love story of a man who comes home and his drunken beats up is wife or otherwise is so good to so good she never said anything she was such a good woman she never said anything that's what you're expecting the good wife to be write the stories that we tell around us are the stories that start to define who we are and it's interesting to think that when the compressor is written in 300 something a day at exactly the same point in 312vary across the oceans in summer in Turkey the first council of the Catholic Church is set up and they immediately from setting out start saying how bad is Pleasure how bad is the body that sex is the road to hell on the other side across across the oceans on the banks of the river Ganges what's and sitting in his writing the Kamasutra and his saying how good is Pleasure how beautifulthe path to Heaven so we have to narrative that come up at the same time this narrative from the west does permeate our nation quite strongly because as you know India has always been invaded and occupied since time began almost you know from the time of the mauryas if you think about the fifth sixth century onwards we always had in the others who have always got their own narrative with themso you think it was the job of the Invaders like their kind of brought this concept of O my God sex taboo to say that this is bad and we think that the British came in and around the 1700 in the 1600 actually know what the the Western world comment Mushaira Portuguese the the Dutch the and Sona so they've been coming at which also like a set with timechange as people coming as the ruling parties change as Invaders come in the brink certain other rituals and rules with them and sons stories changed over time and it's really really difficult when you start trying to change the story back because that's what I am trying to do with the moment when you start trying to go back when you think about it Ranbirbut I grew up in postcolonial in their case I went to valence I went to Lady Shri Ram College I did literature related Shri Ram College three years of literature study the single ancient Indian text ok not even one so we don't even know what are pass stories were how do we will start to learn I'm I can tell you anything you want about Shakespeare I can give you reference to context I can talk to butfrom morning to night but paradise lost I came to this country and start the study again I had no idea what are ancient texts even said when you think about the Kamasutra was reinterpreted much later in life it's in 1873 does a woman who interviewed it interprets the Kamasutra now what people don't reallybeautiful se madam tell me about the best version of the Kamasutra to read but that's not what it was about you read these texts whether it is the Arthshastra weather is the bhagavad-gita whether it was the kamshastra treaties with almost in scientific manner and all science in those days was dedicated to Godse Davidson in the form of hymns and poetry and then not really even the Natya Shastrathe book on drama and dance and for the average person to understand written in metaforce so there are a common trees that you have to read to understand what they say if you go back to the Kamasutra the only thing that makes sense to the normal reader who doesn't know about what the other matter what is mean the only thing that makes sense is that the two Chinese chapter on positions because you understand what position meansthat's why we come to understand the Kamasutra just about position we don't know what the positions are we don't know why they were talking about that was the reason of therefore for the position this but there is this point about it changes the narrative changes but if you don't even have the basic background of knowing what it was about you can't go back to that story beautiful if you think about it and just to mentionwhen you think about it even the you like ok you take the Mahabharata and so on you take a lot of the photons over the centuries 200 runs existed in some way or the other and they've all been depicted in some kind of statues and sculpture and painting and so on the bhagavad-gita has got no visual depictions till we get the 1801text that is lost when Mahatma Gandhi read it for the first time he was already studying in England as a lawyer and he read it the first time in the translation in English so people in our country 1311 growing up with any of our old tax this whole wave of Writers whose trying the bring back ancient Indian knowledge that includes you that includes Mr Amish Tripathi so my question to you now is that if you I know it's an extremelysecond question to answer why was still try asking it so for a modern men and women were three separate end of learning that they can take away after studying the Kamasutra the way you have just three loan is three learning for men and 3 learning for women if you to boil it down like that I am going to tell you actually done where is that I am not going to give you three separate once the men and women can I tell you why am I give you 3takeaways but not separately and I'll tell you why do people also come and ask me what about their relationship was the Kama Sutra Seva their relationship like I said it actually talks about pleasure It's about what gives a woman pleasure and what gives the man pleasure it doesn't say that a man has replaced the women or woman has supplied to the man and so on that we're talking about understandingfor me the first thing that struck me was the fact that there is absolutely no bad language used in the book is no abusive language if you think about our sexual vocabulary of two words that we have for sexual organs of abusive words ok we go backabout all of these words with such atah beauty even the vagina for instance is known as the Chandan Mahal the clitoris is referred to as the Madan Chhatri the umbrella of the love of God and so on so I think that the words that you use start to also define your actions the moment you stop thinking of that as dirty and bad and abusiveyour mind already starts to change in the way that your approach something right the next thing is that it absolutely does not permit any kind of violence through the entire text itself in a moment of passion and men might get a certain point Vahi Yun Hi lashes are the moment of fashion you can't do that you cannot do it so hard because I soaking this to his mistress and apply it is Mr son f****** that this and hurt his mistress you cannot do thisconstantly itself that you cannot use any kind of violence and aggression and it goes so far this is the first text that actually gives women a sort of equality a platform of equality and give women the right to consent it actually said that it is up to the women to decide if the pressure or the the passion that is being used is too aggressive itsmoments of fashion if you love bites you too hard is that love bite is too hard for you tell him to stop if he doesn't stop you buy it and back twice as hard to his thoughts which we always think is a really cute wears it but it's the first time that women are being given the right to consent and I think that's amazing the next thing it tells us is that men and women both had very very different forms of pleasure from and the pleasure is like fireit's very very quick to put it at night it's very quick to put out it's just like fire starts down that it goes up but a woman's passion is like water the pleasure is like water it starts here it goes downwards and like water it takes very long to come to the boil 6 very long to come down and so it it kind of tries to express its education in such a way that men and women understandyou say so that many women have left the road the pleasure is never going to go inside because it's so different so how do you actually go about doing this in a way that you both feel the same arousal you put a that there in each other's company and I think it's like I said it's not just the one thing but it and I think that it's just this my dear of slowing everything down it's it's aboutunderstanding that you Slow it Down because there are other things to do the other amazing thing that I think is it take away from this it goes out of its way to explain to man that women have a very different form of the other and the first time in the first few times the to make love if you are 2-10 if you if you don't make a pleasurable for women you like she put her off with the rest of her life she tells a man explains to man how to go about itthen said that the most important thing in this chapter in there in the in the in the computer is made up of seven sections only section 2 deals with love making and foreplay itself conversation is your biggest thing so before you make love before you install your foreplay what is the thing that you are supposed to start with conversationman must tell the women stories to make a shadow inhibition and start to get her Desire going at 17 and at this point you have to tell different types of story so you have to can you tell stories which are striking gossipy on notice something that you get a reaction from basic research is supposed to say I got you know you tell us that you knowyou have a different set a conversation because after you may love with you before we make love you supposed to have a conversation that was excited after you make love the conversation is even more important because he says that the way that you finish this time will define how quickly she comes back to your bed next time at the end of it you have to now tell her beautiful stories of lovers to come together and they make love and theirhappy retirement love because you have to convince her now that I actually was what you done is a good thing and it's a good thing for both of you really really it's impressive the way that he gets into the psyche of both men and women and I think the most important thing I would like to say and I want people to understand this the Kamasutra is not about eating women how to s***** man become a social activity to teach man how to pleasure women because then300 something it men were not sure how to add in a women were not taught how to read or write the men were taught how to read or write and hence this book is written for men and the Patron deity of the Kama Sutra is not come they've it's not the god of love and desire the Patron deity of the Kamasutra Saraswati of Music and learning because itself that you can be rich you can be anything butonly a man who is culturally really well versed he is the most desirable lover of what I have to ask you the be obvious next question is that from the chapter which talks about rules for men not rules but guidelines for men could you give us like 4 or 5 pieces of information for the younger is watching thisyou have to make yourself worthy of the woman is not good enough section 183 defines How a man should look after yourself physically so you have to look good for women you have to learn all these cultural arts so you know all these young men would have not known how to play musical instruments draw itself and so on because you have to be able to attract women to youand for long-term attraction there has to be a diverse personality is not enough to just be one thing and say yeah well you can you can see me today and tomorrow you want if you want either a lot of women or a lot of women over a long time to fancy you you have to create a very diverse personality for yourself that point number one for the young guys secondary it's that talking about love or talking about exercisepleasure is extremely important but women do not like straight out in your face bad language this is actually very good for youngsters for today because he said that you should constantly send messages to each other to keep that excitement going and those that you didn't have texting and WhatsApp he literally uses almost everything that it is avocabulary around on about how you eat changepond what kind of pahuncha what kind of meaning to it so you give this Pon and it means I really love u give this point you send this one would send the part you send this and it would mean I like you but I am I could take your leave you send another upon it could mean that I have sex with you Brampton different to you also there was different ways of sending messages they were differentJodi that you could wear to indicate that was for both men and women today for some men don't necessary by Jordan but it is this whole idea of a secret coded language between lovers and you know what actually a lot psychologist today will say that couples or people that have more code words for Nokia of Amazing love of a seduction actually have a healthy relationshipromantic relationship because you have your own internal channel with the person is like having a private joke it means that you know you can just close your self of even if you're in the middle of a crowded room Sunday that can be something to Trigger a memory and you know it's so I need the kind of take you away from the world of these books that you read any task you were the wisdom you gained from itsee you enter a room with a lot of people now for you specifically you what would you see in a man and think to yourself ok that's a very well rounded person that an attractive individual from the wisdom you gain from the book how do you apply it to your own daily lifetractor to look twice I think that's pretty individual I didn't know that doesn't count much but for me I have discovered overtime interestingly that I immediately Gopher summary where I find the conversation more fascinating if I find someone who can talk to me about a lot of diverse things I do find that I find myself spending more time with that personyeah I think it when you enter the room there is always a specific type of person that everybody is attracted by the device objectives for individual looks wise I think everybody goes for whatever they find interesting I personally find that it is the conversation that I am Toronto and I think that as time goes on that becomes more and more the case at leastunlocking but for everybody not just for me because I've had people say this to me in the past as they gain levels of maturity that looks you can only focus on for a certain amount of time very short lived amount of time I think that is always the conversation that you take it that much further from one minute of 15 minutes how long can you locate summary of droughtit's going and for me personally what keeps going to meet somebody who has possibly got the same wide breadth of reading I really really find that very attractive you know somebody who's had gotten some people knows what literature and talking about and summary was a sense of humour somebody who can make me laugh but I am not talking about the ok fineChauk se Saiya more and more that it's about the southern States about how to get the other thing I find that nothing if something is to perfect it turns you of Italy chocolate box something is too pretty in person go to Fossil Like even with somebody was too perfect dress to perfect look innovative I don't know say something about that person then that becomes known exerciseI think it's always good to be that it was something that is of that we personally this ability for great conversation can you work on it over time I am talking about both the genders can men women all the genders in any human being worked on the ability to be a better conversationalistcan go into a session for you into a few sessions with a teacher who teach public speaking that's one thing it's more than that it's about widening your interests and there is a chapter called the 64 skills the famous 64 colours that 264 colours were not to teach you have to be a better lover they were to teach you have to develop a more diverse personality because if you are interested in12 things you are able to talk on 12 things to me it's going to be far more exciting if you can talk to me about only two things of that's the only thing that you can talk about that really going to limit the amount of conversation that we have because those might not be the two things that interest me so that I really think is sheddingpart of your brain this is not for me to talk why there is a lot of physical and young guys who have this thing about what they think is cool and manly to talk about that because I had guy said to me I like it we talk about summary and also my god that that guys really sweet I will be like ovoid good that's the worst insult that you can give a man andno that isn't actually I think that he would compliment from me because I like to spend time with that person but it doesn't and when they will are you no no no that's not it when a woman said sweet to a man should I don't tell me I am a woman don't tell me what I think and what I am feeling I get also a lot this is also very important when it comes to conversation I get a lot of people writing into me one thing advice on sexual matters and a lot of themit's me and say I like to do this and this in bad is that ok don't ask me of the woman that you with that person is good for you in every sphere of your life ok I am not saying that if you are not a good speaker you want itwe call it in the train we call it being a better storyteller every leader till now every effectively that is now knows that the only way to get some it is a tension is biting a good storyteller its when you tell the right stories and that doesn't mean stories from ecology and ok bye generally be a good conversation but my biggest advice is extend your interest learn to develop interest even the ones that you thinkthis is not man Lena interest you will automatically be a stock but more things beautiful if you date a Boring person to become boring I think in today's day and age if you take too boring person you are more likely to leave that person going back to my generation if you married Boring person irritated you because you are a lot of people in my generation did tend to stayin that relationship for longer it was the way life was in the old days yeah you would also become boring because it would unless you really really rebelled against that and came out of it and made an effort because it would kill off your personality also keeps talking about how physical intimacy contains a lot of exchange of energies and they say that couples who are together for really long start thinking in the same way become kind of one personhealthy love with the exchange negative traits does any of the books talk about this kind of concept of an exchange of energy and exchange of personality traits through sex in a newchecks that it awkward sex and yes they do say that when you even when you kiss someone actually case summary mouth to mouth for an extended period of time you do exchange your energies there is a transference of 1 and a day together when you are that closely think about it even if you're sitting room with somebody for long enough on one sofa let se and just chatif the other person is really like you know you will pick that of a new start of your city by the end of the other person is really of their when you know buzzing and bouncing around your pic that they are definitely there is an exchange of energy in ancient times the game particularly in Tantra and in the ancient Chinese erotic text they talk about how to balance out this why certainduring sex so that if you don't want to take the other person's energy on or in a lot of the cases it was it was said that you know you had the other man would ejaculate into the woman said the woman would get his energy but he would get her and it was believed that a woman had a much higher level of energy it is believed in ancient times that women has eight times the capacity for sexual arousal than menand before we come to this old patriarchal narrative of sale O my God woman is loose because she has a x amount of capacity to be aroused and hence it is very difficult to please the idea that was that if arousal is supposed to be the highest form of energy she has a time per level of being able to gather honest that energy ok so it was believed that a man cannot get womens energy because she cannot ejaculaton to him so there are ancientI don't know anybody would like to practice them where the man instead which AC rating is the woman could actually suck the women's sexual Fluids into himself and gather her energy I don't know like I said people say that they can do it I'm not convinced that anybody can or can't unless they practiced do this for I don't know like that isn't the case but the interesting thing that they do talk about in this release eventis that the sitting position is the one that was considered the best simply because then nobody is underneath on top which means that one is not given the interior was not sucking that in the sitting position you have any equal chance of getting each other then it is very as they also said that when you have sex in the normal position face to face and you kiss at the same time you then create a circuitif you complete the circuit and the energy Khud rotate and within both people equally how to absorb in one conversation but I am still gonna keep going on it so the next question I had to ask you was that have you read anything about aukat aspects in physical intimacy and know that Tantra contain some are called asthat begin this whole section of a podcast with you explaining 15 to a 20 year old what what is it what does the word tantrik mean what is tantrik sex what is the world of Tantra in the modern day so that your average 22 explain the ultimate goal is to achieveok but they believe that everything is created by god that's been that you have to understand everything there is no such thing as a good knowledge and this is bad knowledge this is pure this is impure everything had to be understood so that you could actually get beyond this this wale of illusion behind which we left and in understanding each thing you growmy see you grow the awareness levels of your mind which means that you open it up more and more the idea being that you get to 1.5 n Chalai where you are so over so we don't talk but subconscious and unconscious we talk about different levels of awareness you become so aware that you are able to see everything clearly around you with the naked eye today back and the other was time to considerthat's not exactly what it means if you imagine science tells us that the brain is capable the brain has approximately what 5 million stimuli at one time or something like that it's important that we pick up only a handful of them as you grow your levels of awareness you are able to pick up more stimuli around you say you notice that is the final say you you kind of get past this wale of illusion this What they mean when weok but somebody being able to in quantum mechanics they say that if you keep walking into wall a million times eventually you have to walk through it so the idea here is the day say that you can reach that level of awareness that you can see the molecules to the naked eye so that you can actually disengage the molecules and atoms and find a way to that would that level of awareness now we know that this is something that may not necessarily havecan't disengage the molecules but as a scientist as an engineer you know exactly what I'm talking about so this whole idea of being able to understand each thing one bit at a time to grow your energy to expand your mind you needed the energy to do it with that energy is difficult it is the Kundalini and I think that's what it's not about arousing the Kundaliniit's about a school sexual arousal harnessing the strength from its because energy that is out of control is going to be destructive so you had to build your mind enough to know that you would be able to harness this energy when it came away hence there is a great deal of them is not but that's what is a great many practices that are based around sexual practices or sexual yoga the idea being to comestate level of meditation to balance the mind to grow the night yes I mean I do have some amount of knowledge of Tantra entrance was given out for the listeners basically spiritual practices that are for general benefit for an selfish reasons it referred to as Antra and country in the world of yoga a spiritual practices which are kind of for yourself to benefit something within yourself am I right in saying my mumyou know gain ok that's like one line answer to a very deep concept but for me ok you're not a Gori sense for instance your body now people always be horrified when you say that they go is are the ones who will live in the cremation Grounds and that practice is to eat a lump of ROM Flash from the cremation ground other the body that burning on the fire but they say that if we say that this whole world is an illusionand we have to get past the solution then there should be no difference between that lump of flesh and this lump of cabbage with the same thing this is all this world of illusion that we lived within the veil of illusion that we left Behind so it's not easy and unfortunately we don't most of us don't have the capacity because it takes the hell of a lot of inner being to give that a man can you imagine yourselfI can't I can't see myself even going down that path so I think it's just extremely deep I just find it very frustrating because everybody Talks about athletics about sex and it's constantly trying to remind people that that's not what it was about if people really want to go off and actually understand a little bit more there is a group of goddess is called the mahavidyas the Goddesses of ultimate knowledgedesert and Goddesses and they worshipped only with tantrika practices solli the top under in a hierarchy of the topmost is Kali the bottommost incidence is Lakshmi even Lakshmi is included in this group of Mahavidya so Lakshmi is a Hindu goddess traditional Hindu goddess plus she is a Mahavidya where she is worship 3 tantrik practices read about them it's fascinating lete said I think the biggestthat we had them into the worst thing that could be done to us as a nation as a race of people is that all our ancient literature was WhatsApp and put away and shut up and we have lost all of it there is so much knowledge and awareness that I have to ask you question which might seem pretty stupid when you get it from jhataka surface level perspective but how does this kind of education OU absorbing this bookthese ancient texts how does it change you as a person again keeping in mind your modern day life what do you gain from this piece I think that it to understanding you know if you are going to understand the role models when I talk about strength in a strength or ancient sextalk about building up in a strength because it is only with that in a strength that you can deal with the world outside so you know and are ancient sex always say that it doesn't matter what you believe your going to face the thing to do is to create a balance in your mind so whether you are in a happy time or in a bad time that time will pass everything will pass it's all about how you react to it how you deal with that time good times canSach you make you lose your balance bad times can distract you they can make me to do your balance idea is not to learn how to deal with Good Times Bad Times is to learn how to deal with your own mind you are in a safe when we come to that point you start trying to figure out how do I understand strength where are my role models so it's very interesting because I ancient furans particularly described this when I say to you ok build up your innerfrom this point of view on Saptami where do you even start write some people say meditate karo meditate what what you were created to actually give you that understanding that you use a different different strength with theirthe idea of inner strength becomes something that only a woman is supposed to develop so when you read your books when you read your storage it is Sita aur Draupadi that have the strength of mind they have the inner strength people like Indra aur jo no you sister all of them go out and fight back of their strength is of the muscle and there is a wonderful chapter in the story of Durga in the Devi Bhagavatamthis is because it has been created and the Gods are trying to fight against him baby has not yet been created to fight them to defeat him and interest really very angry so he goes to his Guru Brihaspati and his eyes tell me what to do I have to see this guide go into a Puja so that you know all the grasses are in my favour mitron ko interfaces and Brihaspati said to him he said I can't go in change the planets I can't go up there into the heavens and you will change the grassI am not a fortune teller I can't tell you what will happen what I can tell you is that you need to build up your inner strength so that you learn to deal with adversity in the same way as you learn to deal with victory because this bad time will pass and eventually you will win over you win that time will also pass and you need to deal with that and this is nonsense is Fossil who is like you and for women for Warriors live concerts about writing you just going to yourbreast me so unfortunately we don't have a role models that we can fall and we all do you need role model I think there is a lot but I find it very longyou know in the Arthshastra cells that the 64 squares of the Kamasutra are extremely important for you to do really well and business it was about understanding so many different things it's not just about your stories about understanding what motivates you I tell you something Ranbir this is something that I have learnt ok when I talk about the Kamasutrawhen I talk about the the pleasure you talk about the slogan as the things you talk about the beauty the Elegance I find that are Indian audiences totally get it when I talk to my Western audiences you are the closing of a God sex with the time for this DNA is life is different what ever we might choose to save a brought up we all have a cultural backfound that we not thought everything that we know some things are just part of a DNA there automatic learning for cultural background if we don't understand that we don't get to the next point So I found this inner strength kaun sa bespoke board really interesting I feel like strength is really wide concept that applies it safe to like a bunch of life hacks and life skills which could be the strength of focus on the strength of not being shaken and tough Timesso I really like to answer about you know how you gain strength from these texts because that's something you can apply in the modern day now speaking about strength one of the recurring themes on the podcast is meditation and spoken a lot about meditation on the show but what I really wanna ask you is couple days meditation on the part of his book would be in the same room as someone who may be slightly low energy that pulls the energy down what happens to the love between a couple of the energy betweencouple wedding Marathi together may be before engaging insects or before Europe just having conversation does does the kind does couple meditation play a role in making two people closer I think is something that your relationship in anything that you will increase inChristian music now we also have this ancient concept about using different sexual positions to heal chronic illnesses so when I talk about their mean like when we say that ok the ultimate energy of the ultimate strength that you can get it is from your browser to sexual energy in which you have to harness and zone imagine if you are honest that andand if you have a bottle you feel it with water in whichever way you turn the bottle the liquid will flow through that depending on that you you build up your sexual energy and depending on how you make love in what positions you can get your energy through your trusting and through different types of reading and the way that your heart pulses you can I clean direct your energy through different streams so you can actually use that to createactually cure chronic illnesses even think like a low hemoglobin and stuff like that I get now in Tamil about also using your positions to meditate so there is a certain man to sexy yoga positions that are used and in these was very interesting is that the first thing ever do is the devil mirror each of those positions totally so if you look at any of the old paintings in the miniature paintingyou notice that both the man in the women always in exactly the same positions of one has one hand bracelet that everyone will have the other one has one foot brace and so on this again is about balance again if you look at it from an engineer's point of you when you have When Everything is incomplete balance everything is still energies on there when it becomes dynamics is like you have your things move CIDbring everything to complete balance so the sex ayogya positions are generally done so that a mirror Each Other completely the next thing they do is there actually come the breath they will place each other's hands on the partner's Noor Jahan per you know that the nadese the Nadi is coming out just come the breath because if the breadth is too hard then you are not in your Norton balance you not meditatingall of this is generally recommended for if you're doing sex yogic meditation the only thing I have to say is that there are very few people who actually understand it properly or teacher populate most people most people are going on that same path of free love f****** manure and it's not that so it's going down that path necessarily AdvisorsRace 2 your meditation together people who have been with each other for long time take a lot of time to build up the rows of the chemistry is such that when it is when you in your life together for excited that when something is better in your life for longer it is going to be slower actually that the Intex say that it's better to be with somebodywho your pain wait for a long time with chemistry is not instant because it takes longer to arouse each other or two rows yourself and with that you hand is more energy you are you also experience all the prejudice as a closer look so also use a slightly inappropriate question of inappropriate or not but is a role of intoxicants in ancient times in ancient love makingintoxicants at all like maybe Cannabis Reddy alcohol whatever interestingly they say that I am a couple of drinks a very good feel anything more than that will slow you down in an ideal world two glasses of red wine or something that was like Red wine and they say that one to make your breath smell better secondly it leads to colour your lips syllabus and give your lips at night and thirdly it to get rid of your inanything more than that is not considered particular record but that's not to say that there are other texts that don't talk about it but then again it goes into other areas of exploring certain things weather but by and large like a set that comes the computer itself recommends two glasses of red wine because it said that just write anything of that will slow you down the most people don't realise thatbody has this month it has won story of energy ok so anything that you doing you are taking the energy from that if you eat in the mail the energy will go to digest the mail first it will not go to your sexual organs so if you try and have sex after a meal it's really not going to Bakrid sex because your energy is being used up to digest the millions that what you need for good sexreally good blood flow to the sexual organs anything that going to restrict your blood flow to the or too slow it down is going to end up in not good sex but what activities cause that kind of blood flow exercise exercise in the best thing for you they say at the concert was said that exercise is what was make you really sexy the correct kind of food is very important you know it was awkwardis there always horrified when I tell them what is the best after it is there is no food that you can eat which asali turn you into good lover ok like that is sad reality of life nothing will turn you into a but the thing is to get rid of anything that causes bloatingyou eat something and different ages what get rid of bloating will be different thinks it also said that you have your meal after your love making not before if you can help me I have to ask you this one question which I wanted to ask you the first time ever I saw your videos online with his way back how much attention to get from men like a after one of your talks like you know because the subjects you speak of and also Ione of the most captivating public speakers that have come across on the internet so you know what what kind of attention to get from men and when do you know that someone's you know approaching you in a bit creepy where do you have like a can of creep radar in your own head I have to say I am getting older I decided to go grey as you probably noticed this is very new to change thatthe same kind of what did you get very very excited I everyone had people thinking that I was specially doing just that ok I just MP3 and say I know what you were saying to me like you did notice 1100 the people in the room but no sorry but I think that the upside to this isIraq forget them mines going you know it I find a lot of women when they come to the talk will come either because of trends toward them to order think it's going to be developed by the time they leave the live in a very different state of mind and I can see that changed and I love it because suddenly they realise that this idea of pleasure is not just that one thing you notice that won't sexual act it's so muchso much more to it and that they can give themselves permission to feel something else and that's what really makes it for me your adjust I can get the more people that go back realising that there is a good thing that it is actually not a simple dirty thing even the Creepers also come if they can come and realise that ok we were in a room full of people talking about this and Baileyis not such a creepy is it doesn't have to be dirty Aakruti I think I would achieve the goal somewhere what you are strapped what your strategy with showing people away like how do you kind of politely say goodbye audio you just avoid the politeness from different initially when it special Indian men what works best if I say I am already married and SaturdayI thought I could be said to thank you for an hour then not protect the moment I think your another man's property that some of themcan you search the more intense conversation a lot of them now get scared because I think I will no more than them that would really show the map so then they don't know what to say that could not handle me aspataalOK what is the downside your personal life in absorbing this quantity of information is there any kind of downside is that I now I am aware of myself I am intelligent woman I am aware of my opinions and aware of my likes and dislikes and I am not going to be railroaded into something I have a definite level of Intelligence which I am not frightenedExpress and that can be quite frightening summary I have been married now for got I got married and 85 35 years old and I always think that my husband has to have been an extraordinarily strong man to have dealt with me because I'm not the easiest person because that said I have a mind of my own Sofia to people in the house with their redefined ideas ofCity Plus independent I am not going to be told by somebody show me the baitho you can't do this I choose to make my own decisions I don't say you get to tell me what to do we make our decisions together we support each other and finally I changed because of my work and because of my beliefs I also have a lot of friends who are made not just because this is my friend's husband but I have a lot of friendsand it just simply friend so to have that kind of inner strength and you to have that level of understanding that it's ok she can have those friends without me getting Supreme De Jala something shit what the hell is going on I think that I think that a man needs to be extremely strong woman but I'm just saying that traditionally a man is never had to be in that role women on the other handhard to build up their inner strength because that's the narrative and of patriarchal so not that I have marriage experience to reference but what I gained about successful marriages is that you kind of need to be a reflection of each other at the same time have enough differences to keep things interesting write something there thatmarriage day should be like two pillars supporting the same Edifice that means they need to have enough distance between them and of closeness something that connects them but enough distance because if you like this all the time is off work I know what you mean tell me about anything but a do any of the books that you've read speak about the concept of soulmates of what what is said about Soulmate in our cultureagain I am going to go back to this if you think about your soul your soul is Immortal right side must be the largest thing in the universe when your body dies that soul is that there is not it's not possible for one person to satisfy your soul and at different times they will be different people men women and children animals activities that will commentsfeed and Naresh was sold at a certain time so I don't believe in Soulmate I believe that you can be super super compatible that you can find somebody that you have a really wonderful time with with then you need to cherish that relationship by giving yourself and of distance that you have other things that you don't make it still on a personal note I must admit that to me my soul needs a lot of nourishment and it comes from different thingsthe last section of the podcast is all about a subject that I've been reading a lot about recently which is modern day witchcraft do you have any kind of knowledge about this in the east because the Goddesses everybody has within them a certain aspect ability that you can do there I don't believethere is such a thing is putting a spell on somebody the Kama Sutra does have a whole section on putting spells on people if you read it will be laughing for one week because this it so much nonsense so I personally even something they say oh you know you can put a spell on somebody you can't in Tantra the idea is that you actually develop your own Awareness to the point that you know how to handle something you know how to deal with summaryCause when you become that that crude are you know exactly how the other person thinks that character you can tell how they thinking so you can put a spell on them but you can definitely talk to them in the right way so that you can twist their actions like I said earlier an effective leader always knows how to use a story properly no effective leader without proper story have to be a storyteller to be able to manipulate just a little bitgood of the bad always you have to be able to lead the people a certain way it's that simple I think that every person inside them has the ability male or female has the ability to be aware that which ought to be a goddess if you want to call it we all have our energies and strengths inside as I am I just find that with the moment we give it a titlewithout thinking of it in a negative way like whenever it ok bye Tantra people automatically sets with respect to it and I like know there is no such as you learn to listen as a negative aspect to anything I think we're having said that I mean I truly believe that I must've innovation some life was like Sorry forget that and in cornwall in one purchasing when there is actually a museum 2craft which is a fabulous place but if you go there you will find that they have the most exciting things because then pagum science with different things that they would save a which is tools so what are the things they have that they have these little round glass balls almost like a Christmas tree Bob that were actually comes from this Christmas tree bubbles of Glass balls were supposed to be athis was because you would be reflected in it and you could see your reflection and Society ok I can see your reflection I am going to capture the selection blah blah similarly in ancient times the mirror was supposed to be a tool of witchcraft so you like if you wanted your lover to come to you selected as a woman who wants this man to come to her and he would she wants that he will not be able to think of anybody elsewhat is the spell she would really put on him she would sit around a room with Mirrors that each each place that he looked only got to see her everywhere he looked really got to see her and he couldn't think of anything else that was all he will be thinking about you know there is a different way of dealing with witchcraft bitaya as far as I'm concerned because the Goddess we don't call them witches give an account of what happened in my life recently I was on aSimone and made over one of those apps and on a second data actually she mentioned that he is a practicing which like that she practices and witchcraft so as to what that meant and she said that she has learnt to do spells from her family like her grandmother was a practicing which and I did feel this every sense of her trying to do something on me as well I don't know it was just like a gut feeling on a circular 2018all automobile almost 2 hours daily and it can make you very aware of your surroundings of the people you speak to of their energy and it just didn't feel the correct and energy and that's what made me exit that date and kind of rid of a lot more about witchcraft and what I found is exactly what you are saying which is that yes they may be a world of spells but the world of knowledge that you gain from ancient texts your practices of yoga practices of meditation their able to give your own internal spells through whichlead people well through which you can as we said manipulate people well and you can can do work these so called super powers through your book so maybe that also answer that previous question about what does this will teach you in that if you actually learnt this is what you areyou're gonna start and you understand how to use it and if you also have got yourself to that point where you can recognise the other people's energy is you every time now and then you meet someone say got it on like this person that it's too heavy it's like this you say I am sutron to that person it there and it is like this and I think that is just what it is it is that person's energy is the effect it has on you because if I am very very jumpyhave an effect on that the person that in such a way that I wanted to have a particular effect on that person that will also come through right so it's just is NLP neuro linguistic programming you know it really it is all about understanding your energies and put this like I said you know we have all these texts that go back into an array in JSON parse the talk about building up trembling of energy dealing withwe don't have two stacks we don't have or we don't have so we today I find this The Other interesting thing as a storyteller people always come to me and the se so what is the take away from this and the thing is that is the storyteller we always say that you tell a story you let the story register you let it's print inside that person everybody will pick up in differentyou know depending on what you have chosen to pick up from that if I want to now lead your mind that is the point I will come in at so we don't say that there is a takeaway we say that there is a biggest influence is a story because everybody will take from it what they are capable of taking their this ideal of the energy is very much likestory you know that your energy surrounds you you let it spread to see what kind of impact it has on how you wanted to impact the other person and similarly you want that the then be built up inside you say you are earlier when you're saying but what good is it when you when you read this texans on today we took a look at it very scientific leave from work like neuro linguistic programming from white witch craft fromsetup with scientific lead out rules The Attacks talk about intuition that talk about energy that talk about strength teach you how to use it it it is a bigger area of influence that you come on the final question that I have view is that if you could just again some up a lot of the knowledge that you've gained over the yearsand just give the young listeners were primarily man and I wish that wasn't the case but the Premier League man so if you could give men 5 kind of pieces of advice when it comes to relationships and love like how can we keep the partner's happyyou are you and it snow point say I would do this I don't think like this you have to understand how the other person things take the time and trouble to say that person is different to meet maybe they will need to be approached in a different way that only because I think about it from don't ok point number to think about this as something that will benefit you don't think that your seI had to do this for my girlfriend had to do this for my boyfriend and it's so stupid thing about the benefits to you ok if you want something you want a relationship to go a certain way and you can understand how to make a go a certain way it benefit you so point number to words to understand that it actually benefits you so that you overcome that thing in your head out because a lot of young men practically I find have this huge issue about what their friends will think ifincreasing and too much relationship number 3 women for this particular for men and they could have either male or female partner but generally speaking most women like the idea of more can you know a man gets a text message you read the text message as it is a woman getsmessage she will literally analyse every punctuation mark in its there is a full stop here why did he put a full stop it just the way that our brains are made it so I find that one of the nicest thing that the computer said is about this exchange of messages you have at the moment text you have WhatsApp and so on use that to the best of your ability to read because morenice really not very good when it comes to face-to-face conversations OK then not very good speaking the not very good it saying the right thing but the text message can really be formulated to be perfect use it to your advantage flirt tremendously with your partner on text a WhatsApp use that your advantage number 4 actually try and develop moreI know that generally I mean I have two sons and a daughter so I can tell you this that when they were growing up the boys had come back from school I would say to them so happened at school today it's very difficult to get to shut up all the guys I know generally when other boys conversation levels of fairly basic is not too much chatting it for grantedthere is going to be a need for conversation with a partner you can't suddenly developed that side of your brain that makes your great conversational is fine develop other interesting that you have something else to talk about it and find it comes down to communication instead a second guessing the other person and deciding that ok babythis is what this is what women like this is what part of this is what we shall do not always but a lot of the times it's really good to ask especially when there is a special that if there is a problem or you can see that there is actually ke something coming through which almost could be an issue don't try and figure out what you think would be the solution askthe best way for I am not saying that is always going to be perfect and I'm definitely not saying that is going to be embedded roses it never rains but let that be for the excitement beautiful aseemanand thank you so much for being a part of the Ranveer show I will be linking mam handles down below Gai so mixigo follow me to go subscribe and any parting message for the listeners of this podcast manI just want to say you know we talked a lot about the Kamasutra and generally when the computer is mentioned we talked a lot about positions I just want to clarify why we talk about position fixed I have had this in the past that can hold talks and people of committee of the word also studied staff and 12 April always come along and say to me but what's the best position mam just want to clarify this ok according to what sign if you're going to have sex if your going toit's got to be really really pleasurable for both of you if it is mutually pleasurable don't bother it's not worth it however the first thing about being mutually pleasurable is that the sexual organ should be compatible in size is too small and the man is to be a woman is too big to small it's not going to lead to a very exciting love making however you can't use your partner based on the size ofsending this in your one of your dating apps what is the size of this position positions were created to help to make the sizes more compatible with the man was too small and the woman was too big and they suggested positions on his ties together it would make it a bit smaller than next time you go out to triundwhich by the way is extremely good for you you know it will change your life don't try and pickup the Kama Sutra don't pick up a book that ok bye positions and forget about the positions for that while the cup commentary which is why I get my book which is first be the commentary on the computer understand that there are other things that create pleasure thank you so much for this information will be doing more episodes in the futurecommentary on the computer understand the other other things that create pleasure thank you so much for all this

11,"Ayush Mehra on Love, Long Term Relationships and His Girlfriend of 14 years | The Ranveer Show 40",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm1C4hBPu20&list=PLfNW_1ECVaThQynVe4QDlBM5S6Kzy8CeJ&index=12,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qm1C4hBPu20/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCAhgCH-d0t_I4XPfiUhsEN9Uln1g,and having a 14 year long relationship you know when when I am sending the girl romancing the girl generally in the video and I would just hold office that and this romance in my life through hard work and dedication and taking it slow you can get itAyush Mehra hello what happening nothing I am excited to be over your PC new virtual is so much your life beginSony loose recording this video I told me that by Michael and 2 ladkiyon ki lineit's really great to get that kind of any time at that can affect and shall from boys from girls but also used to like I don't take anything very seriously in my life and I think nothing is going to stay so it's just came out and getting in now never would have it tomorrow so its diagram of an approach that keeps me a little ke ok right now I am liking am enjoying it but it's going to be the timebut coming back to the girls dressing you why do you why do you think that happening specifically because so many digital actors out there's so many actors in general in India why are girls running its tax effect on its more to do with that I have romantic staff and cute videos withfiltercopy and whether the channel is so you know probably because of that they think they are really maybe yoga but when I am sittingI have never done Bala se nikalta hai How are you so romantic onscreen offscreen you are not thatok and that's does I'm sure that's why the Google the following you do but you also kind of a really sweet to all the guys immediately respect for the guy I think if anyone wants to learn how the charm of the human beings that the core aspect of it I really believe they honestly I'd genuinely believe in being kind that's that's the prime motto of my life that there is no reason why I used to be an asset to any one just be kind to one another andUGC everyone being kind to us well so it's like a reciprocatory thing so I think that's the only reason why it works for me because there is no I don't believe in giving anybody a tough timeBengal and it was one good and bad thing and I definitely like all Communism Punjabi have their own laws that will be sure of a lot of cost do like it having Dube into like a Delhi malls in Delhi malls O my God have felt so that everyone was dressed up in the in the most branded things have ever seen in my life from cab to there is not all of them but some of them really look to themthe disk has been really rich when you see somebody unlike a lot of people who is the use of butter andmy dad was like when when when you do well in life that you know if your siblings I want our family 788just spread respect spread good I want to talk to you about how difficult is it being a romantic chocolate boy and having a 14 year along relation CLW there are two very important thing is whatever I am doing on screen is a portrayal of what Romance is it doesn't generally have to apply in yourlife and a in my real life completely different to what I am on screen because it's written in a certain way and have to do that and do justice to that but in my real life I'm honestly not as romantic as it's it's shown in the in which shows in the sketches I do but I really make an effort because when you didn't summary for 14 years you really have to make surethings of have to still be at a level where your attracted to each other your your happy with each other your growing together that so many things which a 14 year old relationship requires then I feel a new relationship because you can probably when starting of a new person there are so many things to do so many things to talk about so many experiences but when youquestion for so long the most important thing is honesty the most important thing is just one reason for being that person like that can be hundred problems that human being but you have to find a one reason why you want stick with this person what you are one reason my own reason is my girlfriend is the strongest woman I know and she is the most accepting women I know in my life so I really lovethat and also I feel respect is very important if I respect her and she respects me for who I am what I am what I am doing then 90% of the reasons do not matter you know like if there is mutual respect for the other person know why relationships over friendships start going for a toss is because the respect angle in them starts going down of people taking you for grantedDosti sad happening with relationships I feel that the time and it goes Downhill how did you overcome your rough patches on meditation relationship will tell you why because since auditing for so long your immature in the beginning so is your partner and then you are growing to be an individual which the person is seenand probably you are growing and the other person is not and at a time there might be that she is growing and you are not so it's about being at the same plane or waiting for the human being to come to that path and then growing together but by growth in theory of growth no awesome growth spiritual growth like personal growth now very Shallow example of sharing supposingly IMOI am I have a sibling I was told to share all my life everything in sibling life is shared only bro in Punjabi in Punjabi is there but when your dating your first inis Cape mine mine yours yours and yours is a very small example so it's been 14 years now she doesn't give a shit about sharing in this entire what is your what is my this but it takes that long for a person to change now she doesn't care about what mine what your it's just as known as that idea of growth happens like this so you gotta give it timeweight if that person is not understanding what being grateful for your life is at one point she will understand I will understand so you have to wait for that person to reach there and grow and that's when will grow together so you are saying like ko your perspectives group exam you grown up thinking the same thing but then you realise this person thinking a different when you try matching that thought it would make sense it if it makes sense to you so now there are so many things we see my branchhuman being and I can only give a perspective ke bro you know yahan se hua hai yahan se hua I am thinking this way maybe I am I change my decision go here she might in addition come here but it's about that what I'm saying is about being honest giving Each Other brutal honesty to the point that your forced to think it is he thinking like this what is the reason like he's not a stupid person so so in that way you meinso that's very important for any relationship what the best and worst aspect of 14 year old relationship best aspect is your so comfortable she is a part of my universe so you know there is not one of thought like a for me is my mum dad my sister and my girlfriend is 1 unit so I have never thought of as Cape alag covid-19 process so that is that comfort is she knows all my friends she knowswhen I started acting she knows my dreams are she knows everything so security for so she knows my insecurities Inside Out she knows my worst moments in life she has helped me through them so they just the same tangent about 14 year old relationship is there are things which you don't have much to do like you pretty much experience a lot of thingsweather so making new experience is a something which is a tough to do but you got to still try and strive for those because that's the only way to go forward you wanna say that you are not married by you can have a kid that exactly exactly and so you just have to find new ways of this be comfortable in what you are also like they've been so many times have people have Satna ka and Unlike the UNtalk less so the problem was sitting behind and we reached Lokhandwala nashta Hai Din talk and you listen to songs and I feel is very important to respect silence in a relationship if I am comfortable with you sit in Silence that Pulp Fiction A comfortable silence if I am comfortable with you sitting in Silence thatI really enjoy your company I don't have to keep yapping all this while to just get a reaction of you like I really like people who acquired and if your sharing something with me quietly Ok Google not ok but you go to respect the spaces like problem she was thinking about something I was thinking about something that the person was just think you what as to not dogi Anya So being silent with your partner and enjoythere is also a blessing 13 things I know that the most beautiful things do as she is very beautiful like come I feel lucky that I've actually got her she is very patient as a human being with me and the third thing is she is really strong mentally is like she's really strong nothing can break who have you ever cried unforgettablea lot of people just generally assume that guys aren't romantic and guys don't want love and mother goes to trust in the lord of guys out there who can die for a stable release the lord who won the Mary Jane Watson for the Spider-Man I have tried in ok like a in the beginning to feel like no account strongno strength and not showing vulnerability I feel the more vulnerable you are the more stronger together so I also know you now and has a brother and you really ambitious guy like I know that would work you doing right now you can of building towards something we can you creating a big Legacy Dr how much of a career support system do you get from home that the first and second question is also expand and ambition for so of coursein terms of our dreams I have certain dreams like I've always been an ambitious kid I always want a Mercedes are always want of good flashy house in a row so I really want these things in my life but like step-by-step I always believe in Breaking down your goalsand point was doing as assisting in films than I did theatre than I did a lot then I want to take the jump to films but luckily web open up at the point of time in my life and touch wood is been great that I've been getting good bye shows really happy and grateful for that and now the next step is obviously going to be digital films of arms is what I want to go at like that's obviously your main goal in life Dua Duaself being a mainstream staff was visualised I can I do believe that I do believe would like some like I've always believed like since I started acting I always wanted to be like there so step by step slowly take time but I will get there because it is also difficult if you are not from this field if you don't know anyone and my penis and alternate my friends are some of them now have made themI am anyone in the start so this is going to take a little time to build your base but then I feel through hard work and dedication and taking it slow you can get it is that it shows leads in movies very verywhat's that one difficult aspect this is a lot of practice which goes into it and rejection how to another level and you get rejected to your face is not see we live in a few studies from the best Institutions of the planet but if you are not good at the addition he is a good so you are rejected on your face is Ranbir KSEB Kodakara ka Milne wala hai aapko milegaNahin a raha hai aur Aise Kabhi lagta hai kya kya kharabi hai mere looks Mein of negative down hill slope ke ghoshit maybe Meri naak Badi Hai Main Bhi Mere Bade thoda Mota aur FIR chalu hota hai sirf degradation to a point where you are not happy with yourself so I request everyone who was going through rejection to not think of these things becauseyou may not be fitting in that aspect that point of time but there are ten thousand other aspects you might fit in a uses of to fit in one aspect or just relax and rejection is not anybody is fault is this probably you didn't fit the bill in nothing personal Soya do like what's been like your worst day of your career with the most like what the problem when they are often times where are you onso many days I remember one of the first initial auditions and come home and the casting director really humiliated me like worries of selecting at the articulation and 41st edition and I was the 40 people nobody was there to guide me Aaram NagarMummy I aur mummy ne bola kya beta Dance audition De De Dance audition ke bad agar koi nahin karna hai na to Chhod Dena but Mere Liye the solution to help me alsocan you replace a very big show as well as a better place for a very big show as well that happened like anything but you know these things you can't take me to your heart and believe that you can do it ok then I feel there is a lot of a lot of heart if you live with Grace anything ok maybe do not work out not work outno point of being bitten sad World Water what do you get anyone over the job uske upar ok kya fayda hairomantic so what you are what is state of mind my state of mind was to do something different and broaden my horizons as an actor and like you ask me a word carreograph do I Wanna Follow I really wanna be a fab actor you known for their back to insult that respected as an actor and not from anyone else but also from myself that ke brolike I never thought I would be able to do you up accent and it was really difficult to think I want to see the finished product and your like ok you've done a decent job I'm not saying oh my life but you done a decent job like anyone who just see is that show will not be like these guys not from their so when I remember you are coming up to me and said bro I am from up andno chance in hell that I think that you are not from you up and that that that that complement means more to me than anything else in the world that you know so things like these are what you want to work on and and getting to learn new things in like I do if I go to u p now I speak in an accident and it's so cool that I no 1 lakh se now tomorrow if I go to some new place theresomething else it says about learning and growing more as a this thing so this is the space am in right now I want loan like new things and experimental also stick to my guns like romantic show that also be seen that I am doing that and what I am not I am trying to be decent then so just probably doing a believable jobwhat are you doing this podcast is coming to an end to end an existing one thing when I speak to a lot of people from industry Amita loda actors as well but very few guys who live life with Kanha discipline that you do at home and so will I get up at 5:30 in the morning and all that so kudos to that do like where I see so many people party in online Friday or Saturday night you are thinking about your next to do with a lot of people who have guided me in my lifespecially my parents like they've really help me then my girlfriend other some people like to friend my call Aditya like these are some very very important people in my life who probably shaped the way I am my sister so ja so it's thanks to them and luckily you know these these people always come in my life or at a point and they teach mesomething what I need to hear you know like when you are having like a shit day and you this call one of them and this is the right thing then you like you can you like just give all these learnings within 5.5.2 success formula first is to never give up whatever you are doing I feel you should never give up in life everything in life is achievable everything in lifethen I really believe in Breaking down your goals you don't have to reach a point a to point Z in one shot it has to be gradual and if its gradual it's better because you had more experience you made more people your probably getting better at what you do so that then I think there is no substitute for thislike you have to be discipline in order to achieve something in life because everything fades away and the only thing which can get you back on track is discipline even on a bad day is good days I will give a shit do what is needed to do like you have to still do it put in the work in the work there is no substitute that then being kind I really believe it I really believe me kine Karma and itcan you carry it has been kind to people to friends to your family start start small bro like start big and I feel being ambitious somewhere like everybody has to be ambitious in life but like have something to work towards that I don't believe in your meant to do something for options after that I feel purposelessness also has a purposebut just have a goal even if it's small to Big B L ambitious about something on the other even it's about being a good human being I am saying as basic as that like this look forward to something something to always look forward to thank you thank you so much man thank you so much I hope you enjoyed this thing alsotell me about your Gionee a letter as a youtuber like how is it going going good I just feel I'm very lock turn on life right now adding look good but not 10 like a bad at all just am working on two three views projects and I feel that we say something has taken me for individual is challenging myself to get to the challenges of a lot of the same beef black Roli taken on a lot taking a big risk in career but also going on with positivity and discipline for sure will happenI'm sure you are meant for big things only hello I am very very conscious of Who We bring on the podcast like all the time and like I question if you decide to bring on one person I question it like 20 times with you why so Instagram I saw your interview with the visit was again I have too much respect for people who respect their own work so I saw

with over the correct way to sleep the correct way to eat the correct with exercise with the top of this about meditation andhealth as well please watch the entire episode but right now let's get started first look thank you for being on the Michigan most welcome secondly let's begin with something like intermittent fasting if it is a phenomenon that taken over the world but if you look at the history of the world always kind of been there for some reason I think our parents were generation the newly promoted the idea of something like breakfast and you know eating regular meals and all that but scientific speaking nowrecalibrated it we calculated to take us through the hole in the middle fasting science superfast so I will is always existed like you said you know there's a passing mechanism built in the body and feasting mechanism ok to go back to evolution you know I want to you to understand that we need to think with our own Minds not based on what we learn react a lot of fun learning to do that for example breakfast was not designed by as it was designed by breakfast cereal company their propaganda to make us you know have breakfastyou create breakfasts were needed most people generally don't feel hungry in the morning and intermittent fasting is great it is the most inexpensive the cheapest the Freeway to attain not just great weight loss but to Boost Your immunity information your skin in your hair everything it's taken care of when you faster Bruce Lee tried everything your sleep as well you sleep people all the patients were an intermittent fasting is a look we don't talk anymore with sleeping better automatically and this is a fat but people make you fatthe box 16 861 of 15 2016 16 hours of fasting and error was often the minimum for all the benefits were talking about a something is good as 12 hours ok which actually really doing at night already 12 hour fastingintermittent fasting doesn't have to suit everyone if it doesn't suit you don't fast it's not everything right you say that like some people what happens to the metabolism is different ok some people are highly diabetic sugar levels fluctuate ok but most people as kids when we grew up we were not hungry appearance at the forces with breakfast and stuff but what happens after good night of sleep the body is still in detoxification elimination mode so we stop the elimination of the moment we start eating so when we get the physical craving for hungwhat's the time the body is asking you feed me not yet gotten it don't eat for an intermittent fasting you find it in Islam in Hinduism in the Bible every religion talks about fasting as a way to maintain not just Physical health per emotional and spiritual health is wealth cleanse your physical body and your mind and human body speaking about organic is it true that if you fast longer got bigger benefits for you like some people say that a may be like a weekly 18 hour fasting once a weekwhat is that true is not necessary Ranveer everyone is different I know people fast every single day I know people who do a one day fast in a week I know people who fast once every 15 days and each of them have their own benefits that is derived from the people made of added every single day blindly in not listen to the body is a simple thing is your today is going to be different from tomorrow tomorrow we have a lot of mental workload of you know stress and stuff my body is ask me for food in the more I think more calories I need yadifference idea is to listen to your body if I am not hungry don't eat Gautam hungry it so bishanpur ourselves into a box that will be make intermittent fasting into a fat diet of coffee because everyone The Dictator coffee outlets logically think of fast means just what is the shutdown the digestive system that would copy into an intermittent fast one is we know cop is highly acidic 2 is coffeestimulant and something acidic into a body that cleaning itself to see amino religion talks about these things will be still people if you doing fasting Dua to right way or don't worry all ok don't feel left out because everyone doing and you can't do it reaches own what do you do when you feel hungry through your fast don't you just drink water ok and the beauty is once you've got through one or two days of this 12 13 hours in your body such changing the physiologic changes on the third day you want to break of yours Like I Rememberabout this force today's incredibly difficult like by the end of my father was a week you fine change your training the human body

know there is no knows that WBC looking better every thing did they fasted boost immune system with relaxed information to be tough people do wisely make an informed judgement and do it is one of the best examples of the body being a healer for itself known he is no doctor huze Veeran here we enable the body and intelligence of the body takes over and intermittent fastingintelligence helps your

again to the idea is to introspect like when I meditate when I get up patientwe look inside and see what can we not accept that going bad in a life you know any negative emotion why is it difficult for us to accept or let go out in the magic words are acceptance and letting go you are so if you think of any problem that you have in life anyone the youth anyone any problems you have in life if you can tag Haider acceptance or letting go there any of these problems it is no longer a problem now acceptance and letting go is a very easy thing to say but difficult to do when we get the strength to accept and let gouniform inside no one can motivate you to accept and let go no one can teach you how to do it work for example if I need to accept a toxic person in my life right now that's a wrap for example ok I can't let go to person but I need to accept do I look inside what is stopping me from accepting this person it comes to do things my own ego on my own Pride nothing else nothing else that person is being the way he or she knows is the best way but I have the issue of accepting and Bakers Pride why should a person behave that wayknow the person can behave in front of me I am Dukh example even tried so when I meditate I understand this and then I realise that if this person is known to be stressful in my life I got the acceptor get the courage to let go and that comes only from inside any stress alive today everyone has less people are trying to get rid of stress you won't get rid of stress you learn how to take stress acceptance of living meditation is the first ever helps

use the term silence sitting Justin silence for 5 10 15 20 minutes you know only inside thoughts beginnersbecause when on silence are conscious mind is focusing on everything around here we want the subconscious mind to kick in your life for so that the autonomic nervous system right now underway at your breathing tube reading unit and make your heart beat per is beating you know that your subconscious working automatically for the autonomic nervous system for your body knows what to do our conscious mind essay for example the conscious mind I am good in the bowl of ice creamcontest Mysore is full of sugar is full of good related fat gain with acidity with the subconscious mind knows nothing ice-creams in just did you produce an enzyme Acid uses break it doesn't work on ice cream but you can't is my nose is it is a big difference of conscious mind is what brings all the problems the subconscious mind doesn't know where Ranveer is stressful on or stressful ok it doesn't know that is my true perception ok I like RanveerChala Gaya NATA subconscious mind believe that if I perceived you're someone who is a knowing the supporting his mind believes that even those on your perception got which is why we say meditate to see the fruit fruit like not licence you don't know the truth of you who you really are you are so many of my clients like like what drove you to create this most of them don't know the answers that how much is enough they don't worry answer between ourselves reacting to what remains of build up that successful somenot bad thing and for some people success am so they only noticed she is famed because the mind-set has linked fame with success and we want to meditate to see and sometimes they changed a complete a students in universities in Boston the best universities meditating they start meditating and they come back and change deadline completed their role as I was what my parents want me to do but now I know what my truewhat to do when

it's been that one force that told me the next steps in one again I feel that comes out of place of perspective when closing as 21 to get an alternative perspective on your life and be able to see on life from a bird's eye view from the top level is AC or cap doing this right am doing this wrong maybe I can try doing this to your practice of meditation Ranveer shows in your videos with depth that we talked and talked a superficial levelcan only come from someone who is aligned with themselves as people with Scorpio for everyone doing on different shows and is trying to do the same thing they would need a superficial level but you online with your fruit your line between tension so I can meditation help you realise your intention of what you want to do without intention we can never achieve any goal and also on a biological perspective when you get into this advanced yogic meditations the one difference are seen in my life is that I genuinely believe that it's something related to increaseoxygen content in your bloodstream so I think like Pranayam your breathing exercises they really Hype oxygenate your mind if you have some insight on their logos and every prescription of mine globally not just Indian patient has Pranayama written on the food eating organic food throughout the day but absorption everything in the cell trillions of cells require the life force oxygen to have less oxygen in my body myself to be most mostjob the pomegranate Laga likhate Pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds I think I'm eating apron not absorbing it is about how you observe what you eat oxygenate dhera dhera camps in Mexico that work with end of life cancer patients ok and all they focus on is how do we oxygenator cells oxygenating the cells they can boost immunity humans on your own ability to fight cancer cells on your brain work faster faster so why do we feel so good when we do deep breathing while and I tell peopledepress is all you need to start a process that takes less than a minute Lesson 2 minutes but you change the physiology of your body so someone is extremely stressed right now in a minute we can move from stress to a state of calm your problems Mr Bean room

minutes everyday use your skin health change your help change you see this your brain working much fasterand when you get the alternative perspective if you are going to an anxiety attack if you are you not deliver some can mental health issues a lot of it can be kind of cleaned up just threw a good practice of Pranayam absolutely in a depression and anxiety patients and all of them are Kids allowed limit teenagers with distinction how to breathe and feel better and I feel it is not only after the session if you good for about 24 hours Ravi se listen it made you feel good for that long now if you start doing everyday you begin the first step tothat in fact the next topic we need to tackle mental health is becoming a huge issue for kids today is two primary reasons every one is Lifestyle choices to a process food too much junk out the lord of smoking cigarettes Laura smoking weed lot of over consumption by colebennett thinking the second factor and I hate seeing this is social media a grateful I am very sensitive about who I purposely follow on social media as well I Wanna Follow positive accounts but in saying that is a lot of negativeit's not just like you unpopular negativity like other popular negativity on the people about things like nihilism and it is the concept of believing the life is meaningless and if you're telling a 13 year old a 16 year old listen man life is meaningless obviously there is a higher chance of them falling into some kind of a mental health you know whatever situation a bad situation for the mental health so speaking about mental have looked I just want your quick opinions and your quick solutionshow can like a teenager watching this dramatically improve the mental health because I also believe that mental health is the core requirement of a successful career absolutely mental is everything everything starts with thought think about it if you are feeling sad right now it started with a sad feeling happy Dasara offer happy talk everything sucks and the mind we have to accept that everything is your needs to understand right now ok the fact that where is positive reader will also be negatively where is happiness sadness weather this weekbeta it's going to be the exact number 1 everyday is not going to be a good day for you but social media and the world has projected that A Light That We deserve the best at everything right there we need to change that might be the best but it doesn't mean we get changed that means it's like to know I will be looked at waited in Abroad after De De aap pampered and spoilt to the health of parents doing this about how set up like they get what they wantBande wanted God ok to not good thing because when you move into the real life style you get from your parents who what when when you are out of your home and your in real life get that is we then you start feeling emotionally weak because you got it throughout your life and now you feel that can you become a good is emotional I am deserving but I don't get it no one is a deserving We Own It should be on the gain that is the truth of life so when we keep is called ove intelligence call instant gratification if you get what youevery second you wanted after a while you can take them for granted got a what happens is that so used to open and shifter so what happens if we get everything we needed a Doberman need something mote stimulated with your feel good hormones like to feel good on this release your brain every time you in under Goa Highway motivation molecule everything I have to find a way to motivate my people to work everyday I am I gonna Run business people have become self motivated people have to do that it's not the job of other people to motivate peoplelook at the new generation dene constance motivation why Indians in gratification any role of that we need to break that day when people don't get what you want a musically categorise themselves is depressed most of the people depressed out there or not the press the label themselves they went to a psychiatrist and psychologist saying and depressed and the psychologist and psychiatrist for depression themselves depression for most people you are a bad relationship you brokersad depressed fine ok that doesn't label you as a depressed human being in is a face in your life which you can you get out there so teenager to get into relationship be ready for the sweet the bear the pain the happy return if you're going and only expecting the best don't in relationship life doesn't work that way and overall no mahoday movie show to you no matter how virtual in one social media shows that you that is not the truth if you look today even the forcesyou can do with the forces are happening is following a pattern that indicated by the movies how the divorce happens in the movie is exactly how it happens in real life but when you look at the actual paper in the lowest possible to be that way people are making everything that a seed in mind a simple example we have to change of mindset if we have to remind ourselves constantly that people do not have to say the things that we want to hear all the time and people do not have to behave the way we werethe moment we change that mindset and we accept that people will do what they want say what they won't be who they want to be if we can accept that then we allow ourselves to accept different behaviour if we don't have a rigid every time someone says something you want to hear or behave the way I would be depressed angry and a person moves on with the life and we are the victims to change your mindset is the first thing but also coming back to clinical depressionwishing clinical depression and yes of course those are serious cases because the victim of a patient is allowed insult spiral To Sach bolo Sach lower in the body is adapted to add no longer produces the right amount of serotonin and dopamine for example I today if I tell a cancer patient that you have three months left live ok and the patient is a weak minded patient will die in 3 months and doesn't have to be because of the cancer that has to be because someone within the polity has planted that on the subconscious mind and we see in this case is happen front of600 stronger Mysore clinical depression it is bad entire system of the mind the body is completely changed and indeed that medication to move the amount of that it's not the end along with medication they have to make Lifestyle changes they have to look see everyone on this planet has a purpose and social media like you said a lot of people their life is meaningless if you feel your life is meaningless it is your job to make a meaningful is your job is your accountability and responsibility responsibilityon everyone else but at the end of the day you are responsible for everything that is happening in your life everyone thinks to you what you are solely responsible for your life you can blame and complained that the drain you most want to pursue more or you can use and easy to move on and change it difficult but we have to do it is it fair to say that everyone who diagnoses themselves with depression is not actually clinically depressed and kind hundred percent like I said most people most people who have diagnosis and Celsiuseffect today there's a lot of scientific study talking about that the more psychologist talk to people apply se kam on going to talk about your problems you going deeper and deeper and deeper into it it ok you once but now I need to move the conversation on how you move forward know how you get deeper and Medical Research even coming up on how counselling has to change it part because the more attention on the problem the more profit and gross make you talk about your for example relationship that is depressed you more and more and deeper and deeper into it and itdistraction in the mind right now your empathizing with you but moving onto a path that can get you are not give you at which is a correct the error and correct exercise plan everything exercise the food that you meet your sleep that you get and the company that you keep today most teenagers are depressed because they are in the wrong company is not used in it is it it's it's a middle aged woman to present the press ok no after come back to this one it to tightencharging the way I look to be address as a duo new anything I write an order prescription change your group HR solutions group at 18 age level we all want to Vuitton you want to fit in with the coolest people will tell you one thing the coolest people are the most insecure people because they need to you know make this false operations in front of people to appear cool because that's where I get attention genuinely good people not that bad people need help you want to be a line with the cool factor Zafar thatAbhi on mind coolness in different aspects in your life you know you need the hang around with some cool to be cool cool cool person doesn't make you cool and anyway when we bring on depression because well written or false life I want to be in that group persons is the coolest group I need to be with them for you with them do drugs with them smoke cigarettes with them it's not adding value to my life and all at how much affected you feel something like binge drinking pot smoking all that is required no in moderation you can get past everydayin the modern day with teenagers missing like this big wave of marijuana take over the country was in a big way of Thinking party de covid-19 that is in this whole mental health issues game I always say the problem is never get alcohol the problem is never will ok drugs are bad effects of the problem is the person doing it people 1995 having two pegs for the last 50 years of every dayexample you take you take a person who goes in search of abusing alcohol drinking alcohol to feel good about themselves a few more confident binge drinking to show of binge drinking to you don't not stress of your life you doing it wrong intention is good harm you why must you can understand 12 vi nice ones on the way everyone have a good time when you doing every week and something is wrong with you what why are you feeling it is not cool and the people who initiated the people who want other people to be likeWe Can't Stop themselves I can't stop something how do I feel better about myself make you perfect I make you part of drinking is its I think it's a very you know it consumer behaviour of insecurity and enjoy a few truly enjoy it is not harm you people smoke joint everyone's done it of course not people when they start over with this so for example you break up with your girlfriend your sad smoking smoking makes you feel good and more and more and morewith the breakup you using a coping mechanism and that every time you go through anything in life that make you feel depressed water you turned to the joint because it made you feel good what is sitting watching the sunset your smoking a joint in your teenager was enjoyed writing tension right intention ok you fine you are possible to find other people were doing it for a lifetime 10 help from the people will be the Messenger of the life but yes if you're going through mental and emotional disorders moving towards a drugalcohol Sonia coping mechanism is going to make you worse not better take a step back observe like the whole kind of ecosystem of your own life and then take everyone everyone everyone is different don't compare my depression if you have you had been doing it doesn't mean the difference of your own beautifulthe basics which is the fuel your padding inside your body and the ways in which you are making a body move so this is a 2 file vertical the wanna talk to you about basics about nutrition not like a diet plan or something but what kind of the golden rules when it comes to food for your body ok so I think the main thing is that people love to problem is not with food gram is how we do it that we too much of its origin is a big problem with the wrong time sweet and go to sleep straight away songonly see you can enjoy so many different foods if you just put the discipline of life style to any right time to eat when your very hungry when a body is asking you fool if you just full and receiving my with sli you need to know that your upsetting the entire dynamics of the body and intelligence of the body and stopping you from meaning this is the right time money to write quantity to overeat you can still have the same food you like today tomorrow and the next week we try to get that into a system right now you know at one go Vikas mindlessly 2I think most people just are respecting food ok forget about the iPhone fact that some work and all were so many people with what they want to have a discipline in our life don't irritate the right time the rule of exercise its people and undefined is not a diet that some and made it is money behind it is all of these things and stuff like that I think when it comes to eating food is well we should eat when a relaxed me to invest rests on working for you something that really work for me even before the big change from feverI started having this I started following this practice of only eating when I'm eating asmr eating that's all I don't watch TV I don't read a book I just focus on the food and also makes the whole process a lot more enjoyable you become very aware of when your body becomes full and uses more grateful for that perfect that brings me to my next point is we need to extract pleasure from food at the mail that we just say that gives pleasure It's not work for your pleasure is human its human emotion newshuman being is hardwired Rafiq pleasure and avoid pain in everything we do to become the CEO of the company why what is the other language and ok to see pleasure pleasure from position the money that you want to avoid pain of failure not achieving so when it comes to food if we don't extract pleasure from my phone and you never can do it is important that we can send it amusing wow I truly enjoyed that it is work for you here even if the meal was a great me near Pipli junk food with giftdid not work for you if it's junk trackgpstrack pleasure from it work for you the basics of the French the European they enjoy food no matter what to do when it doesn't affect them the mental status of different approach I think in India vs a bad relationship before we got the tag chocolate ice cream at work in fact this is bad this does bad you can see you know what extreme died in a country right now the question I need to ask is likewise in simplicity workinghealthy but what is a string that game was why do we need to make it more and more complicated his people are not fit into account when it ketokol done nothing against Kiran all think is ok do it don't do it to my question is when you eating food value of growing up of you are healthy as the same food you should be doing now why you're changing with after you finish breastfeeding from your mum the food that your parents when you grow up from a small infant to a young boy it completed your brainliver your heart your musculoskeletal system that food is information to your dreams in your genetic makeup and if that food in make you sick that make you fat and healthy as the food you should be eating your body resonates with its search for a new things look for superfoods from South America never maybe it's good what

you my friend Sarvesh Shashi is one of India's hottest young entrepreneurs and he claimed he is done this to his practice of celibacy I followed the no sex and nofap rule for 9 years and it genuinely believe that if given I'm kind of a superpower to go achieve his dreams to through the length of a podcast asking all the questions that you are thinking of how did you do it what we feel from inside the field or Neon last at any point during his life and have given some inspirational very deeppromise you watch the entire podcast you will come order different human being at the end of it also keep in mind that in the comment section and link the different sections of this podcast and also keep in mind that the description has the ordering of a podcast enjoy ourselves sarveshwari on the Runway show Ranbir show with talking nofap talking no sex with talking yogawe're talking about the benefits of all these world on the human mind and how to build a multi-million dollar business out of those benefits Sarvesh Shashi and customer service having a short amazing bro it's a pleasure having you on the TV show I am going to dig into your mind and his last nine years of practice celibacy number 4 you have been trained deeply in yoga and how to set up one of India's biggest yoga certificationstartup I think will start a business is a much better way to put it because yes the authentic foundation of what we're doing is yoga but we are trying to build awareness ecosystem and who is invested in the Wallace is a lot of people but I say about a little over 40 birth the specific ones that you are wanting to know Jennifer Lopez Alex Rodriguez fiance and partner Malaika Arora my favourite partnerand we have Shahid Kapoor and Mira Kapoor they were invested and Rajinikanth daughter Aishwarya Dhanush as well amongst many many other people who have who are absolute legends in their specific field Soch amazing I feel like with something like the looking at you think of this is a look at the business model and the purpose of the yoga was also looking at you as a guide that something about this brother who is the sole founder of this organisation I think it largely when peoplethey put in their money to three things they look into one is the Founder second is is is this a purposeful stroke scalable business and then the team and its profitability bottom line all that does come but largely this first two three points are very critical for them and yoga is one which is all women its aspirational and the mother brand is called server and server means all a complete and vision statements as connecting saidbillion breath which is the world and service Unisex it's both men and women is transformational device aspirational straight into what the audience wants to know how has how has your retain semen brought you to this point I think I describe my life into two parts one is a life before 17 and the other is a life after 17 before 17 and describe my life with three is which is arrogance attitude in anger I think as a 6 year old child my only amplay cricket for the country and win the World Cup is 1786 I was super Hai per as a child to my parents thought that putting into a Yoga class will help me balance and focus better both as an individual and in my game and I saw lot of difference in my game for sure so time and on life and by doing a lot of yoga the physical aspects of yoga which is what people think you guys doing Surya Namaskar meditation I am too young to do that and Choli for women extra70 my dad took up the Yoga class which we couldn't complete EPL of money is said service in Vadapalani money just 78 sessions left just take the class and get done within ok fine don't let not waste money and when did the class that this guy was running Academy had long hair long beard Orange clothes and I think you ok a big is another godman going to tell me to follow this feat hi show me a hello lighter on my hair then all thehow is very improved is a child about enlightenment and consciousness as a child as a child as a 17 year old very often called the child auratein but I was always include about intuition like you know I wanted to see the future but very selfish because I qualify open my third I apply for the country faster Greenland is very selfish in nature one but when my when I spoke to a teacher about the first thing he told me was service if you ever think I can enlighten you you are a fool and a bigger food that can help mehonest I really like him I want to kind of you know understand more learn more about what is going to be saying trying to say Exodus went to my dad and I said that really know what I want a continuous process can I use records of the good thing please continue that are my Yoga journey started after about 30-45 days of classes after doing the typical what people think you guys today I started doing a lot of sadness southerners in Sanskrit means disciplineok so I did Lord of 10 11 21 and 40 days address for example you say I am going to go akito for 21 days that you actually following are you say never do this not going to this 40 days aur I am going to do this for 1011 2140 what I was doing a lot of 1011 2140 De Sapna so I am gone silent for 40 days I used to meditate for 9 is a diagram with parts name one is really I am not trust people in namaste Nautiyalbe very very mindful of what I was doing trying to do going to do in my game in in my social life except one and only Sarvesh you doing great and will be given to five precepts in life at great tell me what are the five precepts is Italy firstly follow with I said I will follow in no problem is a remember Sarvesh in Yoga Sankalp ke upar Koi Vikalp Nahin Aise mere ko Hindi nahin aata hai what does that mean he said that which means in Yoga of you commit is a commitment likegoing against your words but what happens if you fulfill that commitment like why would you take up the sky Pizza I before I told him that yes I'll take it up I have done a lot of 10 1121 40 days and every time I didn't and completed I always got one step ahead in my life in different aspects that is professional in my game in the year when I get dropped from possibly the best college teams in the country I became the3D amazing so I said great as a what are the five precepts is the first one was no in toxification U no alcohol no smoking no non veg alcohol and smoking Was Easy because I never done it until then and continuing that was very easy meet a mallu talk much meat Aisa hockey final ok Grade II was non violence nonviolence through actions thoughts and words once the wise man said that a deed is done when the tortoiseI don't remember genuinely the last time I will kill the mosquito that one was no mental and physical stealing physical telling you physically Steel staff mental things over and we have a nice watch I like to have it I can I Aspire to do whatever you want to buy a car by house fly and play in Goa for holiday that's fine but not mentally Steel stuff from people of whatever was no line I can't win white lie if I am late because I overslept am late because I wasnot because I was traffic on the road 51 was by far the most difficult because of two reasons one because my age to because of the accessibility I had it will celibacy AC is asked my teacher what is at Sarvesh no sex so I said ok I am in Ansal API and never had never had sex was easy for me to kind of continue thinking is will be for 40 days returnteacher ki Guruji I calling recording in guruji guruji in Sanskrit Guru means one who brings you from darkness to light so I said Guruji kar denge 40 din ke liye kar denge is it service not 40 days seven years to wait wait I mean 7 Sal meaning 7 years he said that Guruji prime time hai na if not to do all of the five things but clearly a couple of that it is a prime time what to focus on yourselfbuild in inner strength in a growth but it's your choice I say no Gurjar told us they do they do it and then after a couple of days servicing celibacy means no getting physical no and sharing Mainu Rona Jacqueline at the track 17 no masturbation no ejaculation at Jacqueline at all no masturbation at all some like I'm like ok fine Guruji but I promise you what I promise you but anyways so the first one and half yearJolly doing everything to prove him wrong the five things which celebrity no sex after one and a half years after when I was 19 and half I think it became a way of life I am 27 now I have not broken any of the five things crazy so you started when you 1918 18 and you are to stop acne to your back at 25 years ago I became a way of life I started seeing a lot of difference is in me and a lot of things are happeningI think for the better I would like a lot of people think that differentiate between good things and bad things but I believe the concept of when there is there is night so everything happens for a reason the reason is the best that could happen to you so for me it was a life of I am fine I take life as it comes and I am a human and not a light in the anything of that sort so I do have my days where I feel upset I am vulnerable acceptable I think it's all knowing thethis will also change I am doing doing doing people think that you can't be in a modern world you can't run a business how can you not live in an observer why should you live in a running a business like I don't understand the factI mean I think what have largely builds today is because of trust love respect and ethics and values and your honest like Hustle in your world that's probably 5-6 hours maximum day but work is work like coming back to semen retention bro there's a lot of Bros walking is actually who was leaving know the benefits to you said that you know I am surenot just the semen retention and other four Sadhna as well also all together but what difference is actually seen in your own internal world is your stamina higher is your process different largely a mean you are the benefits of stamina in feeling energetic extractors great what is semen retention mean is largely taking that energy to your brain taking it up words instead of having it being released you are takingwhat's your head and which opens up a completely different dimension of Creative thought process right brain activation so on and so you will have read all the I think what happens when when you practice No Papa Open Your ensuring that there is semen retention happening that energy moves to your brain when the energy moves upward towards your brain what happens is there is a lot of creative mind space thatright there is lots of science behind Nakshatra but I think I am more practice what you preach so I am not getting the signs of it but more what I've personally kind of felt is whether it's in your profession that I am playing cricket weather is Huawei watch the ball to Hawaii bole to Hawaii kinda performed because I think semen retention is usually also linked to performance the peak performance level that you get when you consciously and sharing scheme under 10taking that energy up words and that can happen through various Aasan various exercises extra adjust opens up your creative energy so much that whatever you doing specifically when your profession when you are in water by profession you are a diver it's a corporate world weather is a creative world or it can be as simple as being confident in front of people it can really I mean you have to practice experiences I can sayall that I've experienced but you have to practice it not been saying yes right Jude for 21 days and and see how you feel about it and you feel tired after things happen right but I am TV Jacqueline Jacqueline if there is a sense of tiredness in the question that I think all of your should answer but also I feel that I can I keep saying is that there's a whole world of science that the world doesn't have discovered yet I believeas a boy I may be wrong lot of people message what you're saying but what do you what do scientist do what do what do you say scientists what research in the world right now which means that you never say scientists are searching post searchlight what is research mean is already there there researching it so what's there 5000 how many years ago there is searching 100% I will not35 organising a lot of discoveries related hopefully looking forward to some few more days to go but there and we can we can say we go for that also but speaking about nofap give like a quick like exercise that I have learnt from the world of yoga book selling books written by Osho also mention this is basically for you guys were just starting out on nofap it was very simple yoga suppose you are feeling lost your feeling Hona basically it ok to you doAshok blood going to your sex organs The Yoga Institute in one place ok and you take a deep breath and given Mangalore meditation and yoga is a lot of visualisation you just visualise at all that energy is actually flowing about your Spine and your brain so you breathe in and take a report in your brain and and breathe out and imaginary spreading through your brain that all is a very basic yoga and I've seen this possibly help me and my no Papa ne Chalilocation to service your first question is that is located at this yoga on RAW live time in everybody I think it's not one size fits all so as long as you are able to reach what you want to reach I think the process is however it works for you the best as long as it's not having you in anyway and your taking right guidance to do it is perfectly fine here soactually go into one of these advanced meditation schools like the Osho school or Isha Foundation or viruses or Chinmaya Mission School you will find your girls related to controlling your sexual energy and cannot reach analysing it to create absolutely absolute it is this ok and I got the Thumbs Up from the second question I have for you is the obvious one about nofap eventually becomes easy practice this what you see eventually you'll find it easy to beatinitially it is a little bit difficult absolutely seventh take you back to that 18 year old version of yourself who is hormones all over the place what what you're going your head to diffuse all I Can attract and real I mean I am all five precepts in fact because you know it's a It's a it's pretty much reverse psychology right now it's it's natures wish that it was your mind power mental strength that happens to all of your Amisha ussese main diet mein hun get call for 10 weddings you get call for the best birthday parties to get call for best friends this was originally started my died today kyu Aaj chalu karo chalu karo then next to you like ok today morning and good morning you done it after evening I like Ranveer let's go for a party and then because when the moment you tend to take a certain8 stroke gold for yourself then natures first rule is how do we tend to break it would be tested tested stroke break it so whatever you want to call it for the good but can this person he or she will stand the test and tomorrow whether it is something that ok but not lying I know I've lost friendships for a brief moment because they aresay something and I couldn't lioness and listen I can't do it said that after about two years all parents only talk to me they know that they'll know whether son or daughter is the can he or she is in safe hands is no problem at all but it's an really mean the kind of water is lying weather in women who come across it it just another address of things happening when you saywanted it's it's extremely high and the control was very simple we were I was told to a certain exercises physically mindfully extra to kind of take that energy and use it in the right direction which is open opening up a creative thought process extra so I think you are seen as a few hours to do exercise that we were asked to do I was asked to do rather breathing that I was asked to do it allchannelized in the right direction but it was not easy I Milan I am a professional cricketer I was the IPL for three years and traveling with them and at the IPL time zero at games after game that's the kind of the wild side write the accessibility that I had and then following it was the hard part there is an incidence is this been crazy incidences in terms ofAmit will be nice to me the Seth but I've had a bad people change clothes in front of me and I walked out of the room is English in sorry leave me alone I can't do much can I also mention one thing as a brother show when hanging out with you I see that a lot of women are really don't youanything else and I've got this a lot even from mothers birthday daughters from wife from the husband's because I mean I've where they feel safe and I think for me it's about seeing people in the right sense enlightened all I don't have emotions are you don't have feeling but I think I am conscious about them do you think that you know somethingnofap semen retention does make you say for the lack of a better word Lenovo attractive interview magnetic I have been told that that it will happen so semen retention does it does make you more attractive I don't know whether it happens physically or more energy wise and otherwise I think world is energy write the world is particles the world is everybody Alpha particles in different formbut I think it does make you Lil bit more attractive Lil bit more properly and how much limit is coming back to when guys are not on their basic maths meeting everyday with a lot of guys give you the opposite gender in a certain way like you know in terms of attractiveness a lot and boils on to how the person looks for Innovaso does your definition of attraction change when you retain semen for so long you look beyond the physical it is you know because if I have to give you some examples why don't you feel this is attracted to a woman or if you are a Mein Mel aur I attracted to a man if you are a female what are you are attracted to and why is an attraction why is the attractiveness changing from seeing a certain a woman or a man ofage versus certain men or women of a certain age why can't you feel the same both of them have opposite sex and then why are you giving more to know what you are she is wearing one side of the head is certain body parts extract why is it that way to the physical attraction is very very superficial line Amin what are you planning and what are you thinking of it and why is it and if you actually trying to do you meanwhat is Vipassana teach you If people you know if you done with a partner in the passenger auto parts that is under which is focusing on the breath just normal inhalation and exhalation the breath and Bipasha is focusing on body parts actually trying when you see this and other exercise that you know you stroke everybody else can do it the moment you feel attractive attracted Jassi within yourself how is your heartbeat changing what feelings are you coming when is a sensation why is it going tothe sexual organs are not the heart why not feeling compassion and love for that person why not feeling empathy for that person why not feeling that he or she is also my sister cute me my mother why is that not happening and ok now where do I take out tonight or bad by taking out tonight what should I do with that person why is the happening its a question that everybody needs to know and answer then me tell you what happened because if I see what happened people listening to this of seeing this servicemere ko bhi ho raha hai na mera Heartbeat na ho raha hai reaction would be individually but if you start thinking that ok I need to do what I actually feeling not saying having sex is wrong or being physically strong know why why what is it and is it with wood is happening with multiple people what is it that you are feeling good about it what is it that your feeling at the end of the daysomebody doing that it's for that point millisecond of ejaculation time right after your tired and then you are you don't feel like doing it for for some time and then you get back by because the body clock also take some time to assimilate at and bring back that energy or whatever it but for 15 minutes for 10 minutes or whatever it is the mean after having a organism or after ensuring that Jacqueline happens why is why you're not feeling itwhat's the reason you tell me I don't know I think I've ever had sex I don't know what it does but after that what what you open an sex right now I think it's a It's definitely in the one the most beautiful things because what does sex do it creates a new life though I think it is one of the most beautiful things ever butagain why and multiple people is it with one person if you really think I know the birth of a baby birth of a child is so pure admin because even while having sex between a couple at least I've heard this a lot I can't save an experienced it is the thought also of the couple is super important when you having sex when you decide to have a childit's your the child comes up with that thought it's kind of energy gets building with that thought how are you feeling are you compassionate are you lovable are you already know because all of us have two legs two hands of brain and so on so for the right here but why are some people better than us why is why are some people in more materialistic terms more successful in terms of whether it's Fame moneystroke what is the reason I think it it all went sums up with and se Karma which is your past life stroke what you have your parents have had you in that moment all with matter according to be my maybe I mean that said different people have different opinions and I have my own bread yogic theories on this would say that it is a combination of the feeling that the parents having while having sex along with theKarma of a correct soul so if that feeling matches with a level level of comfort insole that's all that attracted into that family that's what the world of us I mean I'm not gonna be fine that subject with respect to my Guruji and my teaching but I touched upon it and I think what you said is pretty much in line with what I've said here in terms of thought process while wanting to have that child because it is one of the most beautiful feeling right I mean you're giving birth to agemother is having the child for over 9 years and under the new being a mean today I think the the feeling of the human being is the most precious feeling on the planet because and that one life that comes out one that comes out of a Mother's Womb that sperm has already a champion but one gets into the womenthat become the child or a living being sorry so I was broke a stray dog question Dua Hona now like do you get like to feel last I mean by all means as if I say I don't I will be breaking what am I process which is lying so I can't lie I do I do I am I am not a light in Dhoni my clothes that I do but the the path is unconscious I know what to do if I get such a feeling and I know how do I turn thatcompassion how do I turn that to love and that gets filled with compassion and love to yourself for the other person for myself and my feeling towards the other person how do I change that into you just said some time back that you see how women are with me why it's not the fact that the diffusive but it's also the fact that I don't feel anything that day when you were theresecond time mile ab while taking a picture i y because there is no internal energy that the thing that I don't have that if the reason for a 85 year old sit on my lap what is the reason what is it is attracting what is it like in a somebody saidwhen you feel that immediately think of would you still be attracted if that person become super old and is not wearing clothes is got wrinkles on the face and then you are mind and your body and your heartbeat changes why it is everything I mean what is everything is am very momentary very very moment I feel we live in a society where people change physical pleasure as a lot like and share the great butgreatest pleasures of mental and spiritual but not AVN discovers Goes by all means as in the kinds of stuff that happened to me in my life by not lying by following the other stuff is just absolutely fabulous it gives a sense of hero of sense of wow I didn't know this also could happen exact every time something happened my work this also could happen this also happened this also happened great could you give us some instances like this like I'll give you one in terms ofwhat happened when I was not lying I don't like it alright so this is told I am I used to believe that the nature kind of after its testing face it also kinds of put together the energy in such a manner where since I've been practicing in for a long time you continue being over it you know it brings power together that ABnice Bande Ko so I don't like that I stop lying extract is one fine day so I am Metro sexual which means I love taking care of myself selfcare I do my pedicure manicure accident I love shopping when I go out with friends in women men take them for shopping shoes cloth them know that there was a really really Day After day mind one day Call Me Up Inside Sarvesh what shouldhan event should I wear black thread so I think you look better in redis weathered wood by Black and she cut the phone studio in Chennai was talking to in the sentences from behind I was talking somebody somebody came from Yemen hit me hard on my back and it was my friend who call me and she is wearing reddo you like why did I read this is 120 because of you what happened black what I do you ask me a question I said where red and the use and never will block you got the phone and you're wearing red in 5 min she said no one will I need my black dress it got burnt it I didn't do it I did everything is a no is because of you using still not that I am not I am not an inventor my teacher good news in factories and studentmat bolo I don't say anything because you've been following this nature will transparent manner that it will happen don't change if so what what happened was in bbsr asking me questions and servicing jo aapko Achcha hona hai vah whatever needs to happen to you that happened to indirectly manifesting I think so I will before this incident the first time ever happened was that he was a in duty we are one of the women of waterpeople collage on my very dear friends crying location to get a visa to London I was like I don't worry you know what you get your visa rejected is 27 and you'll get a visa on December 25th annual leave on December 26 in Godwhat I am what you're saying I got my UK Visa segrate it's good you are crying about it is a service but today 25th ok so you said 2015 I'm going tomorrow how I should I was an accident admin grid is a problem and I didn't really connected to that then when this happened when the that's insulin happens when you when I went to my teacher is Sarvesh don't say anything then whenever people ask me with thisthis happen to me this happen to me I started saying listen whatever needs to happen to you will happen and what will happen will happen for the goodspiritual lives and clean lines and taking care of a body your mind and spiritual body can really increase the power of your intuition for the viewers who haven't heard this one before the common word which people using division is sixth sense knowing things before they happen knowing a waiver of a person knowing the wife of a situation understanding moment before they happen understanding what you should be doing in a particular moment in a particular cross roads in life my question to you brospiritual life style off think everybody not just in a healthy body healthy Gaya fit guide but not just that you are going one step further and following nofap for so long and you know those five pieces to spoke about your taking care of your whole existence on another level how much is a sudden tuition and was a in tuition help your career honestly speaking my intuition yes it's it'srimli and real and I general of incidence is that has been pretty amazing like no no lying next to saying that the happening extra so it's been very very good in terms of what has transpired because of intuition but I think that I have never consciously used it for my career over because yoga by teacher is taught me one thing Guruji is told me that Sarveshquality spirituality in Hindi means adhyatmic which means Apni Taraf Aana which means coming to oneself which means being in the present so if I'm wanting to be in the present and trying to say Achcha cal kya hone wala hai and or wanting to be something being interviewed about it or thinking about it very clearly break in the practice of being in the present northern lights showconsciously right to be included but I think when it automatically happens write like when I met you how great you said let's do this brilliant no problem let's do it but it's very called into two very call it a feeling of goodbye Badi college everybody has it everybody is intuitive in nature everybody gets why visit some realise it because what is what is coincidencewhat is coincident I don't believe in consonance you like ok I met this person coincidently Ne you would have thought something at some point of your life for this to happen Road happened always wanted to meet a guy who's for Road No 5 for like nice if I think two three four years ago when I was in in my school is a schedule of theatre4 plays very very small roles in the place they were all Ramayan Mahabharat related accept so I use it and my eyes to tell my friends and pure group that I will do a movie and I would like to do my first movie with Christopher Nolan everybody was the last hello there I am like Chennai I mean when you done play like what you're talking about Christopher NolanYeh out and they be like what you're saying I said this is why what's wrong you think hi and then started my company wants some really cool yoga people investing in me like you know why Jennifer Lopez or and and name the few other people who probably does yoga and very very serious about it they laughed their Lungs of alag no like like let's think real manwhere is Jennifer Lopez where is your first studio in Chennai Mount Road but I have met Jennifer Lopez now I've flown with her in a private jet to watch your concert reason invest in my company and it happened now some people say coincidence some people say you manifested that I believe I generally manifested I believe that it happened like you know few months back your mister doctor Radhakrishnan said that42 making happened is it also blocked due to thethat intuition and that happens because of various practices energy Pranayama meditation yoga extract next do you have an intensive meditation practice even today but what do you do in USA kirana store for the lack of a better word for simple terms for Vivo S1 and is the anapana of a parcel was focusing on your breath because I believe there are many many forms of meditations available stay in visualisation sound twin heartsdental so on and so forth but I think the meditation of breath which is focusing on your normal and natural breath not inhaling and exhaling deeply inhaling and exhaling deeply you are doing something you are inhaling and exhaling you doing something but how do you bring yourself to the present is to focus on the present which is your breath which is your normal and natural flow and trying to focus on a breath you will get thoughts you your focus will go to different places butit's fine what happened this your focusing shortcomes don't get involved in it be an observer talk will go next order to come will go next we go next will go release in a river Yeh absolutely go because why change is the only constant as it keeps going as your you can increase the time span of your focus on your breath in 2 to 30 seconds and not the focusdifferent John little endian in your waking life it increases your focus level by all means by all means in 1 hour yoga are they will sort your FIR 23 hours of it and you'll be so energetic you don't need exam on the powers of sleep between 4 to 6 hours of sleep is great great great great because at the end the quality is critical and not quantity for regular guy of the bro you had Sumi life experiences you can do toIPL team view almost you play Domestic Cricket you like setup of super successful company now 3 quick life learnings and also you can include yogik learnings in within the 3C I think being through an authentic to what you're doing is very critical weather be true to yourself and as much as it can be difficult Rome wasn't built in a day with easier said than done all these other things can come up as commons when you pulled upbetromas bills things were done so I've always been the first step to 100 metre race is to take that first step right so being authentic introduce yourself for not getting too much pushed or modified modified shop bombarded by environment peer group mein 17 is very very critical second I would say is self care is very important ok I am in self care is Healthcare both physically and mentallyjust take care of yourself is a very thin line between being selfish and selfless you have to take care of yourself you have to love yourself to either take care for others to love others to do good and you can see I can build great business is a billion dollar company but what happens after that I mean if people here Steve Jobs last few lines when he was in no passing away and living is this beautiful world people will come to know what he said so self care is very very importantself care can be different aspects and I would largely se have a mixture of both mental and physical weathering gym and yoga functional training but do some form of breathing stroke mindful practices that can make you believe in yourself make you come to the present and ensure that you become a better version of yourself everyday that number 2 number 3 is water iswhether it's you know whether it's generally anybody being people person is very critical right so I think I always tell people you know what what is it they ask me what is it you need to be a good so the only thing you need to know is people management and if people love you they are your to stay in our employees also employees do not leave companies they leave employers are very importantto be a good employee if your employer and if you are a good employee your immediate team that's reporting into you are working with you exercise very very important so if you're trying to kind of just balance these three things out in your life I think a lot of things can happen when taking care of yourself you are bound to say ok bye have such a mean thing happened to me I want to play this one so why did I start because I saw so many changes in Mysorethe best I could do spread this message that go all out and spread this message that how the yoga company was started and form Nakshatra self-care and 33% things just collectively make your more compassionate person I always say one thing that you know love me like theres no tomorrow and tomorrow comes love again she my brother thank you thank you so much can we thank you for having your show it's a pleasure thank youhumbled listening to you learning from you my brother thank you so much I am getting all of services and down below mix you check my mix former Instagram all social media and I'm sure we'll be back on the podcast have to look anytime about cricket by a journey with cricket journey with IPL three years what I did with the Marine science them but I travel within which is an amazing experience in itself and many more

videos in today's video having some real talk with talking about sex masturbation p*** addiction vegetarian food versus non vegetarian food and a lot more Gyan from the world of spirituality and Ayurved trailer Singh the entire conversation it will bethe time you learn a lot and you basically have fun because you'll realise that even health and fitness youtubers think in the same ways that you think and enjoy the show you guys welcome to another episode of monk-e chat with my personal favourite youtuber in India Vivek Mittal Bhai from fit Tuber the most knowledgeable YouTube come across a brand but he was a lot of knowledge today's podcast is going toabout nofap about vegetarianism about spirituality about your story of by thank you thank you it's my pleasure to be on beerbiceps really and humbled it's crazy that this is your first ever collaboration with that you want to ask you for sleep what is the intention with fit Tuber because you know you doing all these videos which are likebest shampoos in India 10 best soaps in India also talked about the products and I'll tell you a story about how I came to know fit Tuber basically I think is working on with you 17 projects and around the same time one of the brands that you spoke word in your video you actually spoken negatives of work that went with honest like you given on is consumer feedback which is fine I think the wearing their argument but that Brand Factory to believe in action against youwhat happened there like what is this so basically I had made this video in which I had talked about a certain brand and then of course I had given my honest opinion and whatever I had said in that video I very much stand to that even today but then what happened a notice came to me and I did not pay hi to that notice that that was a mistake I believethen they had send me notice that you have to have to remove this content you to do this otherwise you will be taken to the court and and actually that happened I was like summoned by the courts and then there in it was in Bombay High Court used to fly down to Bombay and it was very much new to me I had to arrange a lawyer and when Icalled in the court there I had to speak about what happened but I was shocked to see that they had come will like 20 lawyers they had their own team they had are going Council and in 30 seconds they just blew me up and then it then I buy but Unka products genuine ghatiya I remember the product and even come to us with the brand in this waterwhat is doesn't see about the YouTube old kids very intense working with brand new all the stuff can happen but I am very very choosy and I am very cautious about the fact that what I am promoting on my channel honest with your audience setting that's what the whole audience has been built on by audience is the key for me I cannot like them eat them anyway people in the YouTube game 30 40 50 years from nowpossible still be there and still waiting content and we can enjoy one of those people thank you so much I don't think I am I deserve so much of it but I am humbled really I genuinely the other thing I want to talk to you about is the side of a lot of people don't know about and access something you only have a lot in common with both non vegetarian or nonvegetarian we both follow nofap with more deeply into spirituality it's something we also don't talk about so much you don't likeI want to start off on this whole nofap thing like this is something a lot of teenage guys especially a very young guys at young age what your whole situation with no fat how did you get into it and like you know you are following CSS first of all I did when I came across this that there is something like nofap and all I will require what is the needVicky Donor Degi to Socha Tha ki biological being there are a large is coming up to its not natural but then I was like this happened I was reading a biography about Swami Vivekananda in this here coated this line that if you do not ejaculate for 12 years something else will happen to you may call it enlightenment you may call it you just cannot explain what will happenIPL change that what he had told Anderson treat me like OK then I went deep into this I was like I started reading about it and they were like so many benefits mentioned even in social Summit are there has been it has been talked about like how this keeping this vital fluid in your body can like I have you have you achieve the optimum health benefits Your mental clarity will improve and if you're Awesomemovies on spiritual path your growth will increase like many foods CEO of the even the yoga school I follow they promote Amen did you should retain your semen because it's something called creative energy created so that the other word in the world of yoga for sexual energy creative energy and the long-term aspect of readcreative energies that you can focus much more easily in your meditations so for a beginner meditatively always a Nahin don't try focusing on anything it becomes difficult for that person to start meditation habit of your in your first two years of meditation you should just and get into Harvard meditation for 12 actually into the soul advanced meditation game it does become about focus it becomes and focusing on certain body part of focusing on certain breathing patterns or you know parts of your body somind and if you are able to retain your semen if you don't basically masturbate and if you explain from sites it Really effective meditation heavily in a good way in which is not for everyone also I thinkfor example if you or someone who is sceptical about hope I would just tell them that you tried for like one week 30 days or whenever how much is it possible for you to just right and you will see the benefits coming here you will experience like better Physical health your energy will improve and your mental clarity will improve especially create a professional support help you even more so with nofap I think a lot of people have this thing about ki kaise karengeVijay ke bad Mushkil ho gaya hai yah sach mein main khaunga bahut Mushkil it's really difficult in the beginning I think you should just keep it as a challenge for 7 to 10 days because I think when you keep on masturbating too much less then it's like a compulsion look even if your body is not looking for it your mind is constantly telling you and then then there is no difference between a cocaine addict and master BSNLsolve dopamine release on masturbation if you are 1112 Basil Hira na Sataso one aspect of sticking out that mentality understanding why you are masturbating so much and to understanding triggers link via addiction ki baat ki hai like whether it is cigarettes whether it is alcohol is always something after Engineering Collegekoi ek friend rahata hai to smoking kar raha hota hai main use mein bhi jata hunGoogle Chrome ka Incognito bhi khul Jaega aur Khud Se so I think people basically it again take the phone into the bathroom with them always and I know alot of people then you have successfully basically the stopping the phone into the bathroom they realise that it is going to the bathroom and I also feel that people are unaware they should preservelike why even women is valid for women as well as why they should preserve the so in a way that has been very clearly mentioned that there are certain Fluids in the body which should remain and certain which should go out for example blood cement they should remain in your body you should make the retained and then there are certain products examples tool used in this should go out and specially semeneat some food so it goes through seven stages and after that the last in the final stages semen and each stage takes about 5 days so it's like whatever your eating today after 35 days Seema lot of that will be produced it basically it's very difficult substance for body to produce and that's even if you retain it it moves upwards in the form of Ojas as your rightly said creative energy so that nourishes your cells your maieverything by the concept of semen is ki you can analyse it and create it into a different kind of energy in your body but is the Biology behind this concept that your actual semen liquid does it get absorbed by the cell walls or something like what do you think you have knowledge about this was this research done by three scientist and they had they just wanted to see like what semen constitutes the they found90% of it was water and 10% of it was nutrients and those were the nutrients which included most of the minerals college friend and other minerals which are foods for the brain is basically like getting petrol in your brain it's like moves like according to I am not sure how much forward modern science has gone into it but I was very clear about the fact that it moves upwards and the ratio of yourself brain and the overall body inside22800 breathing exercises through which you can actually change the flow of semen so I have learnt a Pranam magazine on a lot of talk about this kind of Pranayama Republic platform but there are actually techniques in Yoga which allow you to change the direction of Siemens low that actually got into the soul nofap movement because you nice to have to say thatJata ki Yad Nahin to sab log karte hain normal gay watching this is not matter but somethingtalking about things but based on science is not based on science is going to discover 20 million things in the next 20 years about how they are going ahead with this and according to modern Science as well so they say that masturbation is very much normal like we are biological being so its natural Herbs which come due to hormonal changes after a certain age but even they won on excessive masturbation cause you're getting into a loop and you are like your whole life is verymoving around masturbation sometimes I get messages people telling me that we are masturbating 5 to 6 times every day we have to understand like how much time they are wasting on this it's not just that your masterbated that before that you might have watched something so every time like your whole productivity is going on into that only and then there have been certain side effects of modern science talks about certain Side Effects like there is a loss of real sexsensitivity in women especially about this is that if women masturbate of Unlike the area of an everyday is difficult for them the organism in actual celebrate friend that's what the whole sex life of both the sexual partners becomes very difficult because for a lot of guys were having sex sex for fries a lot of fans about pleasure in the whole lot of guys think like that I want to play the girl but if the girl herself is not likethey need it kind of guys sexual life is so badly in saying that it works in the reverse we also where because of masturbating you get very use to your hand on like a penis so when you actually go through sex it feels very different from having that have your penis always so a lot of guys and I know this from Engineering College all my friends we could last for very long in bed like I would like to be havingso when you but they never jaculator so you too much sweating and after having intercourse then they would go and let masturbate which is like a kind of spoiling the Vibe for your mother know actually that's to like when you masturbate excessively too much like almost everyday you doing it 3-4 times then you do not enjoy the real sex actually if you are getting addicted to anything that's that thing is becoming your life is revolving around masturbation during a message100% what's your take on p*** generally like upon something I am run away from for the same reason like that it again it's an addiction at the end of the day it's also one person that is very normalise was always a grown up watching for normal Ekta ki are yaar Sab Log Kahate Hain hamen bhi karna chahie but wrong idea of what is very violent it causes concept I read that ifwhat a lot of p*** you basically start getting excited about success third person thing because you're watching people having sex on your screen and that's what exactly it into your brain ka dopamine release get associated with the third person yuki and seeing two people having sex and that's what I'm enjoying actually end up having sex in real life then you won't believe this is the first person view it like playing se fortnite versus playingCall of Duty web person vs third person example according to me like as you said phone is something which is not real whatever you have been if we see if whatever upon you see if they will just show things just to make it good that's not real and when you are in a teenage you try to grasp all those things and you and when you come into that real kind of scenario maybe you won't get that kind of thing and then you are like thisso for some it's ok if you want to relax for sometime it's fine but if you are making it again if your meeting it a part of your life like everyday you watching that and expecting the same then you are like not going anywhere with watching for knitting most guys who spend a lot of time spent time finding the correct p*** clipsdiamond ki nahin Aaj Main Koi yah type ka clip Aur ghar wale Jattsee this is our opinion at the end of the day I also feel strongly don't listen to people and you yourself so you just explore yourself you just right no you try being away from if you feel that that is benefiting you then I think you are you will know what to do you but don't kind of discount is not experiencing it yourself likeboth of us are extremely scientific people each of our fitness videos I am dead so why does 2-3 days of research team can I do the same to the way we go through detailed studies and that's when we're putting out no 5 videos of vegetarianism videos with water gonna come to next but if you want to learn more about the sinopac angling Vivek bhai video on nofap down below go check it out on the best videos of seen on the topic Vivek bhai The Other big change that we broughtlives is vegetarianism PunjabiItna main main khaya protein is time per ki Ham kaise bhi protein mil jaaye ki Kacche bhi kha lenge Aisi stage a Gai Thi certain things happened in my life I went into a phase and Uske bad it was a little depressing fees and after that I like I went into spirituality and after that I think it just happened to me when I do not have the answer that how it happenadjust it was a calling IAS and but then your body rejected it right like eating too muchby both when we became a dead in which is the whole spirituality game lot of people think that they are you look salary no 5 ke bare mein baat kar rahe hain unke bare mein baat kar rahe hain so how are you happy how are you don't you feel absolutely2 singga new live kind of you don't know that and actually cut off masturbation new cut off lot of excess meet you cut off wrong habits from eating habits and you do that for 12 months that really start seeing the happiness change you so spirituality game I am your meditate also you married so do I won the long-term meditation is that she definitely changed your mind and the study is to back it it changes the structurebrain but uske sath sath one's mind ka structure in biological aspects of your body also change like this whole thing about rejecting food I remember there was a phase in my life I should take chicken breasts boil Karke mixture Mein Dal Ke Garam Pani chicken breast shakeshredded chicken in that and I think just one day when it so that chicken in front of mean I don't miss this feeling too heavy and a very very popped up and that's when I realised that I knew I should try doing without chicken and mutton for my body then I give up chicken then I eat seafood slowlyDulux iulia body rejected road and what was your journey so they said I was too much into which non vegetarian food and one point of time then in that face when I was liquid depressed and I just found spirituality I started watching certain spiritual videos as you may call it so I just feel that I did not know about this time mention of life and when I went more and more and lessthen I feel that I cannot eat non vegetarian food so I felt that it was effortless for me it was like one day I won't be eating it and after that I never interstate so that that just happened and I and I feel that it's amazing now I feel and people think that non vegetarian food if you are not eating non veg food then Vadi Ne Banegi Banegi or maybe you are not getting enough nutrientsI can tell you this very surely that even in vegetarian food you can get each and every nutrient that you want like that I think the argumentvegetarian zone in life then you can never go back because you realise how differently online dating giving example of basically mint kiye koi bhi like chewing gum in teaching field School of a new kind of in love with your brain you feel that their mental state after non vegetarian so Vivek bhai because you are a big rid of Ayurveda because you are also a big rid of Western Sciences I want to ask you what I always says about vegetarianism versus non vegetarianso according to Ayurveda like food is not just nutrition it is also energy it is also why that you are putting and it's also memories it is also memories correct so if you are eating a non vegetarian food you know what kind of wives are putting and there is anger there is here there is violence if you put that kind of why within you basically anything stress during stress and that will come up in the form ofmental education and your life will be more about those kind of wife's so basically I left in the Biology what I understand of it basically when you cutting and animal OK Google can you know living being mounted I like that is a natural Instinct when you're giving me that I don't want I want to save myself and I want to procreate so the reaction of any living without cutting it is that its cells become extremely Acetic Acid levelsall body go up a lot ok so I need even if you do like me to drain the blood even if you are doing ethically it is an acidic substance know your body is alkaline like naturally when your eating like that acidic thing that the conversion process like that hold the meat goes from doing acidic to becoming alkaline in the was obvious in the biological aspect is a lot of heat is released and the heat causes problems in your body is called withto Fir body gets increased heat actually lead to a lot of and that is why you can see people getting a lot of body heating issues pimples and all those like all bad skin quality bad high quality all that the other kind of spiritual aspect of it is that basically if you take off a hair from in humans body of you take off your nails your DNA is in that Nellore that hai and DNA as a form of memory it's like basically all your generatorstored in the strand of DNA your memory is also the actual memory which is your life experiences so and animal has gone through certain experiences in his life and all that gets stored in its mind in his body inflation some possible for me now if you are actually eating animal you also eating all its memory it emotional memory is biological memory and that gets stored inside but also the memory of told that get students schedule that stressthat's what the eating stress means this is something I didn't understand eating non veg to enjoy dinner I love I love butter chicken and you I still say that non vegetarian food is extremely tasty but when you leaving a resident of India seeing the mental benefits of it and then you also see the factory you are not causing any pain to any living being that is even more beneficial than a good tasting foodI believe in even some some people might say that even plants are living in your killing them I would like to refer to this because if you are eating or fruit even if you don't if you don't have to kill the plant at the fruit or it will anyway fall down similarly with a vegetable there are certain vegetables you which you have to pull from the ground so the you have to be little sensible and see theyou can compare the violence it's too less when it comes to vegetarian food also where do you believe this whole thing that forms of life and higher forms of life for example what separates human and animal is that we can think we can be spiritual health and criticize begin question things a dog can do all your dog can be spiritual dog can't like deeply question think of philosophy we are definitely more advanced than dogs a mammal like a dog is much morean insect which doesn't think spiritually similarly an insect is way more advanced than say a plant which doesn't really have thought process if you are eating a lot of our life and not causing pain to the loaf of life is a much more beneficial state to be an absolute don't understand tell you become vegetarian and again putting on weight is not for everyone if you are ready for it don't do it is no life crush on you this is just one week by Daniel experience in our lives that were putting outbirthday of vegetarian model request you from inside Just The Way It Happened washing no 122 Valmiki are vegetarianbringing about how it help in your career and I know it is but can you take a break it down for the audience because these fit Tuber videos with all the researchers and beautifully shot Meadows and all that but all these changes what is it done your mental state like are you able to think motor you more creative kya ho raha hai I think I've become a little more simple person in my life style has become very simple I drive in AltoI sit on the floor and it I love home cooked food bus acchi Nind a Jaati Hai so that's how it is for me land I personally do not feel that I have to AMP up my lifestyle but there are certain aspects to my job for example money frame and all those things and that I feel is for the sustainability of the model that I have created to provide people informationmission which is reliable which is authentic which can actually make their lives change which can actually be acted upon your so that's my goal is that has always been my goal and I think even in the future that will be my goal and money these are outcomes of the value that you are adding to the people and I feel that somehow it will come back to you so maybe 5 yearsline if if I am able to sustain this thing and I have if I am able to maintain the content that I am eating and even if somebody comes to me and tells me that your video has helped me change my lifestyle I am so happy with that I think that he was questioned you is that your doing all this amazing but when you are dying what would you like to be remembered as so when I dieI just want to be remembered as somebody who tried to make Healthy lifestyle easier and because there is so much information people get confused what to do and what not to do so maybe I might be helpful in that otherwise I want them to be so happy even if they don't remember me it's fine with me but they should remain healthy and they should actually understand that health is much more than any other asset that you aredo you think that that is the purpose of your life like to spread information about something like health actually I think so because whatever is happening on fit Tuber I don't think it is happening because of me I think there is some Power which is making which has made me a medium to make this creativity is never your own you are given it and then you are just putting it out therewhat I would strongly believe keep the script we write some lines when I am sure this happens to you also when I'm writing a script to Pata bhi nahin script Mere andar the video it's been like by so many peoplecrazy any Vivek my great having so much fun so much fun to do a lot more hours with you going forward I hope you guys at about this nofap and vegetarian and Vivek bhai Ranveer the whole team

Sex and loving sex I feel like guys don't get spoken to about this topic self and I feel that women will enjoy hearing the male perspective on growing up this is my story from the age of 11 when I witness my body changing in certain ways after the age of 27 how has my perspective on love and sex changed over the years can be very very Candid conversation to the mediumMy Life OK begin at 811 when your school and suddenly the girls in your class who just your colleagues till that point suddenly they become objects of attraction 2005-2006 in the worldattractive Sunny Discover phone easily Discover your own body your own feelings physical feelings emotional feeling not happening there was a young guy and suddenly along with all your male friends you begin to put sex on a pedestal you understand that this thing called sexy talk about sex a lot in your bus rides in your lunch breaks when you are alone with your friends in the middle of class 6 becomes the scent of your life then I'll tell you why it havebecause of the First Primary character of the story not me First Primary character is what I call the dopamine void second primary characteristic all the love boy but will get the latter let's talk about the dopamine wide first as a human being a constantly looking for moments that make you happy moments and give you a rush throughout your life later in life garage through other aspects of your existence but early on in lifedopamine Raj through your marks some people probably the most of us don't argue that the dopamine rush dopamine is the feel good hormones of your body is associated with feel good experiences pleasure It's get the dopamine every time they do drugs don't do drugs as an 11 year old sex kind of becomes that drug to the idea of sex from the age of 11 to the age of about AP inventionbegins and in India special in Indian metros a lot of us begin serious relationships in senior college over new young adult in what happened that point you actually end up having sex and also end up having a lot of other experiences so you compile all those experiences together sex along with all things are going on your life you realise that it was just this muchthis was all that sex was felt nice is only the other things are going on in your life and found a beautiful relationship at that point when I was in college we had a deep emotional connect with your friends we shared many growing up experiences together we spoke about Carriers with each other we spoke about the intellectual topic we discovered partying together with a lot of life experiences discoveredSunny sex is it on the kind of pedestal that it was you can you tell a guy Friend to grow from experience that our Feels Like The feel and realise this one of many other things that happens when you end up entering senior college is suddenly told especially in Indian society are you gotta do something with your career you are told that you need amount to something that added pressurelife it's kind of the from the 11th and 12th grade to get a good Senior College Badaun Senior College pressure really kind of compiles in front of you realise O my God man I'm going from being a child becoming an adult didn't know that this is coming my way if you are fortunate enough to have a great relationship at that point in your life you tend to lean on that person you're going through that growing up face together usesvaluing the concept of romantic relationships a lot if you're lucky enough to find the great partner in your early twenties new lead teams coming back to the concept of sex only Romance is definitely change your perspective son sex after 27 years old when I look back at the college relationship I don't think of the first time we had sex I think of the times at right to have to feel in my exams I think of the times after graduating from college when Ian internship in engineering factory and I was told that you entrepreneurship is not easy in this country and Jagan happy struggler Laut I went home I went right in front of that the memory at it back in the relationship that I had that person to take care of me I had the real human connect sex was just one part of it now at exactly why I tied up with okcupid for this particular podcast if partnered upwomen big realisation of my life has been that when you can your entire life some of your ki dopamine releases don't come from sex men become from real meaningful relationships in a culture with dating apps promote casual encounter is all about compatibility and long-term partnership and the app laterget back to the story what happened at age 22 things change for the kind of breaking out of that eggshell called college life and your breaking into the real world suddenly you are not just the people your age your meeting below 10 years old and new 24 then your meeting possible mentalism meeting people avoid hot and Hasil the same way you are you suddenly meet people from your industry as well not happen to me at that stageI was fortunate enough to find the perfect carrier for myself all my personal strengths were kind of aligning themselves and go in the process of creating a YouTube based business is great and marketing and communication skills that in the day was great at fitness workout fitness YouTube channel grow out his business over the years that exactly were added but at age 22 I was fortunate enough to fill up my dopamine voidI knew that what I had found matches my strengths exactly short wake up every single day with the intention of creating something of going that one for the step in my own career and every single night at sleep with satisfaction that's called feeling of the dopamine void I was also single at this point but that didn't matter because I was kind of hell bent on just killing it with my own Kariyo my dopaminegetting failed every single night sweats to perspectives write your own dopamine why the your feelings through your career and then there's a lot of other people you meet is a lot of other people who also found that trypsin life is a lot of the people who haven't found the exact trip in life is strange don't align according to the carrier The Chosen for themselves for example I met a lot of entrepreneursdidn't really enjoy the process of entrepreneurship the world built to do business I met some youtubers who had just taken up YouTube in order for the business but didn't really enjoyed doing videos for a living didn't enjoy the YouTube game they haven't completely filled up the dopamine void every time I sleep at night after great should a I think message yes we use so good that video I wrote yesterday was recorded beautiful today O my God best sleep of my lifeVivo problem not going to that same emotion emotion they had was at a record 3 videos today ok I love to do this form may be two three years under my business become stable I want enjoying their work that dopamine void was not getting filled and also notice this is just my observation that all of them the same guys with that on field dopamine voidTik Tok a lot about sex the talk about sex the same way I spoke about 6 to my guy friend was 11 years old he bring up a girl in conversation and automatically object by the way I think you know should be great in bad you talk about sex in general and academic and life that's what I observed and I always on the same guy who get really helped about sex in the35 million in the mid twenties the same 2 to had and completely filled up the dopamine wind through the work I genuinely believe that human beings are born for a certain purpose your purpose can't be filling up the dopamine white just through physical pleasures and dopamine void is only feel to your real purpose was the purpose with which you wake up everydayevery time you take that box at night your dopamine wide will be felt that you enjoy feel that white completely not even mine I'm not looking down on people who chases casual sex in a certain place of the life I understand some people want to change those experiences in that perfectly fine I am also cannot drop a big truth bomb I had one casual encounter why because when YouTube started packing of Fame alsobacking up all right and I thought to myself you know what young ones money Goa some fun I didn't really enjoy it mainly because I had experience sex with someone who had loved and I was now trying a casual situation with a person who didn't really love for be physically attracted to a person but that's about it is nothing wrong with this that absence of Love and Honoursex without love feels empty if he was a lot but you don't really understand it until you've experienced sex without love I have some my friends now in long-term relationships we say things like only had one person so sometimes I wonder what it's like having sex with other people I tell you I personally feel assets that one person who you love a lot that's the best kind of sex in the worldthe need to be wise to lot more especially in India don't put text on a pedestal should put relationships meaningful relationships that drink something out and you that would you should be putting on a pedestal until you why to use that second character of the story comes into play when ki character was dopamine void and other ki character in the story is a love void is also something that's not spoken about as much as it should be spoken about after the age of 20love white starts increasing the people you found your career you found that way to make money through something you love your dopamine why it is completely filled up I don't know whether this is biological or whether the outcome of the culture we live in but I have noticed that the love wide increases for people after the age of 22 people are looking for relationships and specificallynotice that men especially in oven metros a lot of them are found that carry your trips in life many of them haven't found their ways to fill the love void is a lot of pressure on all of us in India for young Indian the is going to be carry your pressure on you might be able to sort out your career with no ways that one person at the end of theone person you can call when you completely free my co-founders and Viraj also made to close guy friends in life but this should think I can't tell them which I do end up telling the romantic interest of my life at that point was that person you can fall back on why you're growing so much in your career who you're growing for no you live with this podcast I always try giving you will see itcall to action I don't have an exact call to action with this video but what I do want to address is the importance of acknowledging that it's completely normal to have this love void if you or someone who really feels like you want a relationship they just know that there's a lot of their Lord was around the same age were going to the same things all of us are looking for some kind of partnership especially in the mid twenties nearly 20 years and probably even after that it's very normal to create a relayonly City that I will give you in this case is one Idli and sure that your dopamine why it is completely filled up try finding happiness in your work and procedures in of job options are that find that job that you really enjoying completely fill up the dopamine void I feel you shouldn't get into relationships and you are completely fulfilled as a person and to make Eastidea of a love void is very normal 10 ways to tackle it is based on the top you definitely need a relationship in your life loving partner in your life to make everything complete of a someone who thinks that relationships with the correct kind of partner will take away from your career a very old school mentality only can be young ones and to find the correct kind of partner it feeds into yourHD more creativity I'll give you more perspective the most beautiful aspect of all my relationships till date I don't mean by to speed up my lovely was filled up I always grow in the relationship even if it was the wrong kind of person you grow you understand what you don't want from someone you understand yourself much more if you truly truly loved that person you drive matching up to the class the level requirement of that you will be declaredfood zone and grow in some way or the other the best relationships always provide growth to you as an individual so even if you are looking at relationship from that selfish perspective it ok if my movie not dying won't remember sex you won't remember how much money is your bank account you cannot remember that person who built his memories with that person whose head to head back and they were throwing up who helped by your haven't you were throwing up thatwho tried to the person who tried to you getting converted by that person comforting that person with all your strength and might at what you'll take away and that's why I think it's a beautiful idea to change relationships for young how do you do it I strongly believe you should work on developing interest and hobbies that is very easy way to connect with all the people it expands certain avenuesmind it makes you a more interesting person but the other thing I really suggest that make use of the internet and had relationships where I found someone of dating apps and that's why partnered up with okcupid remember many many relationships and marriages that pregnancy of the next 10 years ago in the arise out of good dating apps in an age when most dating apps a very surface level is aboutcompatible based on looks okcupid focuses on overall compatibility with the help you find the people who could be ideal for you we ask you foundational questions about a political views about your choices and poor about your worldview and help you find those other people would probably match well with you remember I genuinely feel that the heading into a world that people find the life partners from the internet fromdating apps like ok cupid okcupid dating app I recommend to you keep in mind as a lot of women out there who wants serious table relationships from its uses a lot of guys out there who won serious table relationships as well people just don't know where to start with think dating apps all about hookups in never consider the fact that you know what they might be a dating app that about the next step in someone's life next long term relationship with correct kind of partnerrelationship is what you take with you to Your Grave the person that you make all your memories with a person who you picture when you have slow romantic songs that person out that a person's coming when you take one step in the direction of what you want the universe will take 10 steps in the direction of you in order to give you what you want take that first step go on an app like ok cupid and find that purselove is the most beautiful thing in the world duper meanwhile get filled

media industry this was a lot of value to your life and you know it doesn't add values in entertain you are not got Sippy session with renil Abraham this for girls intelligentonly and the theme of this episode is Bollywood Gossip with mum and I love how you put intelligent conversations and Bollywood together you are a visionary people put these two and two together will tell you why delay Braham 125 you been in Bombay for like to three years will be for your four years in September and you've listened to a place in your career where people like dream of being a newyes I feel that is because of the big brain divide rule the world that you have told you that I feel like you're the kind of person who shows one version of themselves to Bollywood and the world will crazy until you like you are creepy that accurate and then does yoga version of you that you keep yourself but you are not bad was not using that liketo progress on which is fine in this process of progressing talking to people heavy networking your loved one of the most crazy networked people that I want my life you built like a massive Bollywood network you are a lot of group is it valid on Bollywood dialogue as if I do without name in saying that with the gossip Divas learnings Shiva Shiva near me a lot of insight on how the Bollywood business words of Bollywood industry worth of wives are the drugthe sleeping around High Court what is this you have no chill out into the blood culture the party and the people around us for as well as my first question to you is that is this drug culture party in sleeping around a real thing Bollywood doesn't happen Si I mean you know how see when I came to the industry where busy liveAmi to I think I am a part of industry now because of lack the people that I am associated with otherwise for the job that I do I should I did not be a part of Bollywood is much and I should be a part of the media fortitude and writing when I came to Bombay the always these notions of like like he is saying like this drugs everywhere there is every within its like it sounds like a massive Audi that happening its it's not that but it's cool though I meanit's not just because it's Bollywood I think happens everywhere right I feel like in Bollywood see ourselves to a lot of people I feel like you will understand I'm sure because I things entertainment creative I think people are a lot more liberal and a lot more children come to trying out things accepting now welcome to trying out things it could mean like it could be alcohol or drugs or like even sleep in around you could say that in every derogatory way within you could also meanlike like like everything and everything that comes to the pH of being creative meddling with art in order that I think it's a very chillspace everyone very like accepting a good word God what is the cheating spouses and all that yeah ok nowthere's a lot of it and I know people like neighbours had done this from the industry and I have I might be even guilty of luck increasing at all like making of you happen but like I am very chalo like this again judgements that I feel like there are people were married and yet have open relationship industry there are people who are cheating on their spouses with another person but like I remember having a conversation with this womanwho is an actor and also like a supermodel she is she is one of the few that she told me she is married to this guy who doesn't believe in love in Bombay and he lives in Delhi is a businessman giving way to much but she told me that like emotional infidelity is the problem like physically if you are like it because because if you know in Biology we learnt food sex in whatever other three basic needs and now if I'm telling you that you can only dreamone pot water bottle but when you're thirsty you have to go back all the way home and then think it is a basic need no so if you just about can I swear if you just got out that might as well but you going by the same person for your emotional needs that because I feel like a lot of people of couples in the industry have that proper distinction so they sleeping around but emotionally the coming back here are the top actors in industries that happeningand I think it's very progressive do ok it's like to imagine that they might be having problems in this together for the sake of it there are people that also the biggest but like but there are also people were baby shall come from the young generation got married and observation about it do you know any of these people personemotional in a good place that peace yoga and meditation with physical physical infertility know because that happened but I don't judge anyoneRoyal yeah but if I ever did somebody who is ok with being open I'd probably be not ok with the beginning but maybe at camera new 2020 human beings are always learning and evolving Yeh Bheem I get there one day I I get Bombay a grown up in the city to understand the mentality that go on the city and its to his own at the end of the day I feel like if you have a strong setup ethics and brought a way that you believe in the following that you are happy for himpeace that matters just for me it's like a broader very old school way like an old school ka 11 an old-school Wi-Fi love someone I love them like everything everything I do so that you are telling you are being brought a family is my life in KeralaDeepika and Shakun Batra and Ranbir in automobile with an iron used as the only people and they were these come in a video and they were probably drinking all I ever wanted to send the admin of the country but it is looking like they will I get glow on drugs kar raha hai and other and some MLA Aslam them on Twitter sayingsdrug related Bollywood in all that stuff I get very concerned when like when you Slam industry because this is the perception that it's like a massive oggi on mdma or something like that what is not and like I am ok with these people are doing a couple of things to relax because they have like 20 hour shifts sometimes and it's like to be accomplished people who like what they are software today I was so I want to add one more thingking of Definitely Biplab is negative so from the industry to reach the top of the top 20 top 30 people in Bollywood you need to be asked in life you need to be in a positive way and opportunities here you need to be a great network a great communication skills you can't satellite just one hit moviethat's why not AVN Nitin Bollywood you can be good looking great dancer 1 hour sexy body that X Factor that everybody has a good body and good looks exactly that I like these days a lot of things are coming to place in casting is a big thing has become like a lot more channel Din systematic and all of that but then even if you domovie where you been casted it's not like people are sitting there wanting to Karti again and again unless you're so good and that's been such a big launch and even for like you will know the launch happens to the launch venue launch happening they have Black 3 movie planned it take one movie because it's very important that you have this one movie and in the next your in like 7 months you should have you next movie announcement because otherwise you will forget you so it's very important to be like out there where did you sleep workingdoes fasting help you get caste does fasting help you grow your network in Bollywood it will help you be seen right ok because your teeth it's all about as they really want to believe that this industry based on merits and although it's not an industry that that life working with people they like and so party is not seeing the you go party children so I could not get drunk and sleep with someone with its just about being visible and you feel like youimagine you are inactive casting directors at a party we are conversation and I feel like you're like me and tomorrow I am casting something like that I think it's not likeGuddu machine my next question durandal is just me three wheeler controversial spicy stories from the world of valued at once you like give me three stories with with or without taking name that you can you give me like a context this give me like ok let's do 111 and the give me like contacts or something like something on the show some other partiesgive me like one Give Me Like The Wild story you can recall that the first one I can't see again like it's not this is not a while for me because I am very simple casual sex right I mean so obviously like private parties are seen and like parties in a club for that matterjust taken for that party at night so pure there are people like very close friends of mine who would like more from one person to another in the same night sex with one person to the other hand like its own right Ameen may be like that I likenot this is what it is a lot of Coke generally Mayur cocaine but like the one on the living room and that one in the dining room and bedroom that on the scene I feel that also have been party is a like that every room VII noting that happened butmore like those who like Bollywood politics like thatshe is come down to his party and she is met a centimetre Mira the store has an actor who remained uniform School by God to Amimale actor in the same room as soon as me Amyra and the other male actor who is going really well right now on the web and all that stuff and she goes music would you do you look so pretty your lovely looking would you do don't tell me and I was situated but why so easy is an actor and this this but that is different for him and ensure that you could do so much better why would you why would be an actorI am like you are educated women who lives in the US you can't Amit illiteracy is not complete your it blew my mind you know I like this is a Modern Contemporary like and you just like and being a woman you like how can you be an actorabe like physical fights in Bollywood first flight between dies it is almost at the brink of becoming physical says in the sense of BC like with social media and phones in cameras and suffered that don't do anything public not fighting fighting not having a problem because you never know whatbut I'll tell you like all of my friends are people are becoming actors are people who are part of our renowned households in the Industry that also kids and their so there is clock or truth that we go to very often and he got 15 summit on the centre table withtop that one table which is like in the middle and I was at what the hell are you doing that one person takes out of phone this is like a lot because the older ones like the old ones still on the Angry group drink too much and then to very like it's very beautiful there are many fightsthe to be valve Sanjay Dutt fighting Audi A4 had got somebody slapped in the house party active Yeh big like proper ok butriding at yeah I mean I mean she would talk about the cells and I am very proud of this one person I am glad you asked me this I mean I would take this opportunity to congratulate Nora I think she is still fabulous and she went through one of the darkest times are anybody could go through in this industry at in the beginning and the relationship that she was in was not good at all she spoke about the forces acting on thebut like but I think the way she just like change did she went through a lot with carrier and your personal life but I think she is like a woman of strength that she motivates me major Lene I am all for people who are not from this place in Lake has no backing no kind of support and come to this place and Like Mike on their own I mean that's one reason really look up to you bro thank you thank you ever been but like covid-19a bit of that but cannot be close to what she has achieved but I mean she really motivate me like before coming you are the reason why is my mind is like watching to use a gift and I was saying you have no idea how much you've grown and become mature and like you have like you know the things you see now is because you're going to those emotional tone metal traumatic event through and like somewhere like she's also glad that you went through because the problem made her the person that yesterday but it's fantastic gravycreamy talented extremely hard working I mean 24 hours left for her to work as much as I love this conversation is still need a third h******* story episode with Richa Chaddaleg while I'm really love Kangana as an actor and not a fan of the way she can't access self in terms of the common that she makes in like the way she is this is people in the industry and like justice nasty things about other contemporary is another I am not an especially her sister who is this just like that I don't know what is it was like if it was a dark place is the black hole that that Rangoli Chandel Twitter need to be banned the kind of shit that she is on thatis just 3D you can't think about people soap I want because each and every openly local people I wanted to get an opinion on this because I feel like if you are strong actor a strong woman does it doesn't mean you have to like step on other people industry you can be a great actor opinion on a lot of things but that doesn't mean you stand on like other people's industry to prove that I am stronger but I ask them how is it because you are openall that you are strong enough to what you think of her and said something I wouldn't have all worked on a public platform I'd rather do it one on one I think to weekly XX ering design of causes PR around it so that people who watch the show now I think Malika spoke about fathersaccused on me too and I spoke about that and so she got back to me saying of the two weeks she told me that angle if I put it out there will be a big challenge motivation again they told me on Twitter and I don't want it can you take it out on a PR blizzard to get them absolutely so taking one piece of thing out with a big thing but I did I do all the time now Reacher never go back to your manager was on that we are reasons that there is no problem now obviously she has spoken about Kangana this was in the episodesaw this becoming a thing it blew up it blew up Rangoli was waiting against her she was which I think she probably got scared because he was doing a movie with Kangana and miss Ada not is very famous for cutting out people out of their movies in the end it's because she is usually closely associated with the editing of the movie and UTC directing also so you never know so she I woke up to this happened the night because Rangoli usually to is sometimes with the night have a sleepingcustomer mis call Samrat job and I called a back and then she was acquired by just woke up and then she said you know what happened in this and that he said something on the lines of you use my friendship to do this and I was like I was very polite and the good condition can offer better than 25 minutes she spoke about how I am I will use my friendship with others in the industry to get together we are to get controversial things on my showand to get headline and that wearing them and I are supplied as I could be I will all of that and that called where I was very polite he told her that you have the equation with me when you could just message me and tell me to take this out your Pyar was on that you said nothing your marriage was on that had said nothing your whole team was that you never got by which of these two weeks ago and then she say something on the line to a measly because she knew the best when she said and what elsethat you can use of friendship to your advantage and like me something fun to watch your table and that like this is the first column is doing the morning as my bed in home I almost your order and then I call a me and I spoke to the above and then this woman started sending me links of like articles online so I called up and this went on left to the day this like she was I know this is completely covered you mean what you me and explain everything to the other in the end I called up imagine as a listenthis is too much your talent like is attacking me so then the better than you know she might be like doing the dishes for the moment I will call you deposit I said I don't want any apology just let this go like I just what it would no communication with this version so because for me I was like because sometimes they want to see things we want to be opinionated opinionated whatever but then sometimes it goes Lewis thenSurendra any one thing bro does the success in the acting world in Bollywood get people's heads ya so I mean but I know that I remember meeting this person whenthe Rise and like he had like movie Run never work like to three of them in the one movie which like blew up not the best movie in terms of content that likely success for something sorry I was very hardlike like I know stories where anyway that's why I like that you like so I will actually going for like stupid silly cheap things and you done at party is unlike very like a very stupid things and and like he was known for that you know and study like he's become like this Oregon thing like who would like look through people at places like I mean if you cannot but I do not like some actors that is working withwho said like we have no idea what would happen to him and these actors who achieve the lot more than he has to understand that the Bollywood hero is the important thing in a movie but there is some of the actors who have been in the industry for a while now and is much better work the year but if changes people also people who are very cool I mean I drink Kaushal Vikas infant I think I would put my money and Vicky Kaushal to becomeI want to see the next Akshay Kumar but I think in the first Vicky Kaushal height increasing and I also feel like when I meet like a Shahrukh I feel like I mean he does his Shahrukh Khan he doesn't that make you feel comfortable you does not give us time even if is giving you like 35 minutes for your show he doesn't have to give us best he can just sit there and not talk to the five minutes and I Would Still Be Happy I'm like Shahrukh sat your 435 unhappy inbut he humble grounded give you his best every time I would have never seen a bad mood in the camera or like you know if he walks into his make sure that they have to come into my crew and ask them if they had dinner why would he care right so I feel like when you completely secure there is no like it against the like being Bichhiya like this you like this one attitude by like where you know that they're gone too far ahead if I think itthis piece where you just suddenly grown and you have no idea what to do with that happens a lot and then there are people who like some of these there is one from a variant I will travel in Bollywood which and a couple of them are doing fine but like one is there who is so entitled and he is he is the black people on BM like including bloggers model sees the sunmodels like bloggers 3 kg is the sun and he is the one who is like doing this I don't know how many kids are there is a certain peopleurgent chilli plant Ocean but like some time and he want to see all of them and actors also were like in their initial stages in the industry or whatever and you really feels like because he is from there they must leave them got this from multiple people and if it's like him and he gets upset if you will be how canwith me I have you seen your people would have standard thing coming back to the positives of Shahrukh Khan man suicide how is humble decide how you know he carries himself with positivity everywhere it was me a lot that certain people why study in my life one of them Virat Kohli another one summer night Siddharth Roy Kapoor and Shahrukh KhaniPhone Screen like I completely get what you are saying in terms of his magnetic and also you understand why life is allowed them to grow to the atmosphere flops in every of the movie after this people will still remember him as superhit hero about life people who actually who are doing well continuously at 10 years when an entire generation looks back at like 20002015 ok 2000 Shahrukh yours and no one else is there but what is what are the most interesting thing for you when you said that you buy black quality from different people write so what did you take from Shahrukh was the most interesting is that he is not too many people know what is needed big late in life relatively late ok and in terms of what I take from him what I classRavindra something called new money on something old money in the world new money is why you Sandeep complete overnight and you don't know what to do which is what you are saying about that young doctor who's had one headphone and what happened to a lot of people old one is when your family have money for tooth regeneration and your brought up in well They brought up among smelly urine show you don't you go out hunting for things you are very comfortable and secure app in Vivo Sharukhan old money is new and old Mayaand speaking of Bollywood of this is not something I know for sure but there is this whole controversy theory that apparently success 12 Govinda ahead and also someone who the whole generation reminder generation is looked up to go in the new one thing right before we get married because you mention I will be the talk about like I did it ok bye like a few people in the industry like that stupid things in the things but I'll tell you when you talk about these people who am Isatellite do these things available for me they wouldn't be enough for me like for me while there are like negative things it's also industry of luck Shahrukh crichton Amit 20 are people who make the stationary Deepika who is doing new metal work but like who changed the like the way this industry functions right to the first one to be on a poster of use budget movie line Padmavat so this is what makes industry for me like mother like this other like little to do with people like you meaningAmeen Ameen Ameen unfortunately we just like the negative part of it gets a lot more but that doesn't Army for me these are not even like the parts industry was like I know it be killed but what do you know that into you that he wasconsulted with them about the movie and apparently he said no to the project because he didn't want to put colour on his body and body pain there this is the stupidest thing that you get at I feel like if you are if you start of that capacity that like you are saying that you've looked up to him know your childhood because I grew up in Kerala and like the first time I was introduced to Bollywood with like DDLJ and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham that I watchdownload from Torrent in itself but Govinda was not like a part of my childhood but like I know the kind of creature that is and how to look up to Govinda and he is we try to embed qualities of human performance sometimes in all that stuff and I get that but I think if you are that structure I think you need to conduct yourself in a very respectful way you can't do a movie like Friday that he did O my God I went for the screenBack movie it was just like I know it I left in the interval said like I had to go down to get something and I just left because this I mean you can't be like in that statue you can't be this like livi I mean you can be playing what are the character but in a movie like that why you're feeling sleepy character trying to hook up with like under is looking girl I mean it's stupid decisions to makeI wonder why people big musicians you know East zone Govinda I don't I don't get what happened growing up and seeing him your doorala Govinda right I meanwhat happened Yeh into Bollywood in the movies that much but you like someone would do I liketrolley collaborating with on something but this so I am contact when you are from the same school which is me and Ananya school has a certain culture and when you meet another person from my school which is the Dhirubhai Ambani international you have a deep why but that wasn't immediately so I've always had a spin the wheel and of collaborating in saying that I do find very cute and very intelligent and I think she want to sleep music of Amber something goodwill I look after you spoke about her activity I think sobut other than Ananya which two other girls would you put in the bracket with tour guide you and you would want people who are already in the industry who made the debut ok so can I can any one person who is just coming in November for so there is God alaia furniturewala who is Pooja Bedi daughter incredible talent I am like wow I miss you are my close friends I am also I mean really good place in my life right now because a lotactor Rai like like they did not now this your next year or so I've seen this of Allah and his incredible so I would definitely something movie call Jawani Janeman with safe the father daughter movie without plugging this movie but but I think she is fantastic eklauta Saif Ali Khan Saif Ali KhanHam to exactly that the person who is this YogiRasiya new party with like are called black casual sex that you think happens in Party All Night of the party with my Yoga told me to cure food with that your 4 pics come back to the contentgive you like to to write I think Biki unity and Ayushmann ok I think are the body when selected as you like that debutRaaz reboot movie to be made I told have told close friends told her that but I thought Anil good good after you know the reason is also made Union service Sara Ali Khan in touch with that all I didn't like no one else could actually had like a few tips in cute boy tips and was movie centreLord Prasad member at excited movie list aadami party and he said To Aisa Laga full movie tomorrow day after acid attack killed it is it so I am like a movie but I thought he was quite good but I think the debut this I think it's very like thunderand Sarah attitude and good and like I want to ask you specifically what I am using a camera what is mean you are a fan of attorneys in story with family friends and I really like your parents and grandparentsthat 2012 tutorial so my family history with names and like my father's name on my birth certificate will be ajitabh like it available nowRanbir so why do we need Biscuit after let ho to Sun that Ranveer or not we Ranveer Singh Bhavnani this review to not be myself baby that is damn cool what you should like follow your mother feed every day can you imagine being called ajitabh I am going to school and college and I think a lot of the girls when updating apps that give my kind of half day today for your name is not do anything can be used to relieve meansfree on the battlefield wow whatever the battlefield me and that's something I I kind of it as a deep thought my head on the battlefield you like be brief do what you wouldn't do usually in Ranveer Singh why has his career taken over desi done correct other than you know the office in the people know likho is selected the right movies Harry has the right place right time thing for them the hardworking Gai Thi Amit offcourseBajrangi again is not a personal friend their Mutual Funds their cost but from what I heard it here I don't admits this all I could ever from the story that I've heard that there was like an involvement of money in like launching himself in all that stuff and how this is like we're think that this situation by like you are like involved in industry through money as a factor in the view that like the 2013what made him the use of course like there is like money playing a part in leg launcher yourself but in this case that no problem when there is so much tiler drive but I just feel like it's this Crazy energy and like no inhibition and lack of very like metrosexual purchased more like a guy's guy but is also very like moderntemporary and like like college it's not like approachable and like he's just like he's a boys boy is also like this sweetheart right is also the he is not like you are Salman Khan who would be scared of he is like he is like a guy who guys look up to and like likelike is used with Strategies and like you are just putting this out and like it dancing on Linking Road that like where will I know youMr productions you talking about to big organisation right I think people I think it it's select few people in these Karan Johar and other Tere and which is this is very cool I have no problem with that because I think in so many years that they have been the industry them on the right to and they have the power and kudos to them yaar I mean this is like I'd never be the same thing but like it's insanepower per like you if like I am sorry current tax office call recording somebody please I want to do this to do it and I am sure that seem to use Aditya Chopra Yash Raj and of course is true that they have some of the biggest talent in the country have been otherwise smart Businessman as well but has like other has Varun and Alia and Vickygreat decision rhymes only had like the commercially viable like the stars now also acquired Vicky at the Talent with given how is Dharma talentnow is managed by Matrix usually managers that there's Wiki was that deserve Akshay there is Varun Alia there is at Tara Tara Sharmaand Anushka Parineeti Ayushman Arjun all the people or so but like Down vs Raw WWE I don't know but I don't think it's too big Agencies organisation but there are also again there are also other things like Dinesh vijanwho has a medic is making some really good movies that also like but it's probably the biggest zamak zamak that can only be age India store brandbut you know the difference basis well here we Bros you like I want to know how did people different from Bollywood people that they be unique beerbiceps menu for the centre for children and simple project Abu one year how is the five different from lecturer Malik Bollywood person and psychology major it down to like the pageI do it to his own like it's person as I can tell you like an advocate of Bollywood actors and because there are people who do that other people who don't you know I am sure it like this page also they might be people who come with like and every Vibe to them and like you I like to think about it but thankfully I have met 4 you guys have interacted with BBPrajakta and unique I've just had like the best time we had fun and I really like the fact that I will now I don't know if once like this big boom in like like if you will change and like the way you want Rajan all that but like of course with Bollywood like it take to walk around with 15 people there is no need for that there are people who walk around with bodyguards who know what is taking a picture with like there is no need but like it I think you need one manager Uni Bunty are you need your makeupstyled assistant to the difference between the children Bollywood in Bollywood adding peoples chase on trousers in digital you don't don't don't forget create yeah yeah school but I feel like it and it might change your life once it becomes like I still feel like we are on the growing like the graph but once it like it's that level now I don't feel change things ever but I really like the right nowapproachable very chilled out many fun real question is can not related Bollywood versus conversation we had once thought to be applied look up to the professional browse KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya air after the whole Karan Johar controversy that was appropriate but in saying that could elaborate a little bit how these Brothers in real life in terms of cricket fan cricket when they are always in some books considered the next Rahul DravidHardik pandya's Kapil Dev success and his brother andshe is beautiful single by the wayRahul KL Shubh you all went to this place in Bandra for coffee that when I met him for the first time and then he when we went on a visit to get Bollywood to is like in this country is like the biggest two poles and they got everyone but back then the next day they were like ok now this is a relationship after Virat and Anushka Di Queen find anybody this nothing no conversation there is no like nothing is going to win friends from Bangalorebut like Hardik through Rahul at one of the parties and but they are very chill people into a life and I am the only place that I disagree with you will be because you said it was likely inappropriate for everything that but I don't think it was inappropriate at all I will tell you why because she because I had personal conversations with Hardik I feel like lucky talks like this right writing is brothers we all talk Lagathings that we would see now my only problem for me is usually careful about where you are saying I don't think it with an appropriate use of the word like how many girls are you slept with horrible I got that you go to a party or that you support this this this I mean that I mean you're not seeing that only guys can a girl also on the show like many girls talk about all these things that doesn't exist that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that the meaning user may not think anything bad about women are saying thatpeople or like having as you like it like that because people have that dissected and people in the country in the world have a lot of time especially with cricket being the Gentleman's game in order that you have to be extra careful so that's the only thingbut still got to trouble but like but I think it was Richard yaar hi talks like this and I'm glad that he was his real self but like just use like to give you with differentyoung kids right ok so that were the ticket Man ke man and God of thunder because it was a Gods so any other cricketers as it become the part of a kid mindset so they might decide it in a casual fun way Masti Mein ok butJanu talking about sex and women so casually fabric that casual and then it becomes a Chinese whispers of thoughts battery something new in the entertainment industry actors of directors or like writers for above and in cricket sports what about now when I am sending a movie contract reconciling the Indian cricket team contact what do I Sign I sign that I will put in all my hard work for it to beto win in the spot in the contract to be the role model for the country and not right I mean I am in the Indian cricket team we can live cricket am I like are we put this thing as of now it's about people who would take it properlyNivea nine year old child might not get it then we restrict the contrary because I feel like you can't make somebody of present perfect you can be certain way but like because I am in this industry because I am cricketer admin actor I have to be perfect I can't be a personal pleasure It's my it's my personal life and talking about it and suddenly like oh you can talk aboutadding old model ine in saying all this the outcome has been that as a cricket scene care and how are you are affected by it personally know because I think I have my own my own mental how to process information that can be argued thatgood boys as well on and in terms of being a cricket fan both kaolin Hardik really stepped up after that both really serious about the game you see even more determination and hard exercise when is going to remove a better bolo I am so happy with the turns the careers of taken god bless those mistakes I remember I send this whole thing went down they were being penalized for what did I know that there is a very close friend and I know him better than HardikI know this is a step back but after that you come back like a lion tell me nothing better what was their mentality and this is going on Obesity took in the side of the things in order that they were the admin of causes order is not playing a few matches in all that stuff is not happening got suspended for a while so I said I like when you get it was so cool thing I like you get out of like pull down a little bit and then you canlike a lion then that's like really this is what should we do if I have a sweet message to thank you enough so I think I did that and I think you doing really well and you know if it continueswhat happened between Virat and Rohit Sharma Rohit Sharma cricket very intense and I was a lot of media Hype Rohit Sharma and Virat for to get a friend we see them on the which they might offend some small tiff with having among any professional microphone the gradual love more than own family we have tips ok but it was that when your playing spot at that kind of a level your teammates are your family you see that when you watch cricketers of other cricket analysing and I VUnder test match mein Rohit and Virat talk to each other is the Play Along the argument on the run out many times but you see the love between the Blood Brothers so it was a lot of you read the media articles you realise that is returned from a very fight fight fight is thatRavindra Jadeja and Rohit Sharma playing a game about guess the cricketer Jadeja imitates Kohli and Rohit Sharma so this is my boy Virat Virat last in the corner and releases next define of thatso anyway man that was like the interview today one last like super quick question I have this is of more personal question do you are like a crazy network in like Bollywood and like cricket and you've reached out like the biggest of the biggest people now I want to ask you because you are really smart guy your street Machale 3 how much we use your psychology major degree to get ahead in lifecommunication skills I think it's more communication skills than reading people were not really I will be very honest I'm in the added to the psychology in Christ at Bangalore and there is a way that the happiest thing because they will give some kind of doctor who will become their parents they want that they wanted but I think I was always good with people and you know sometimes people ask me is it just like so difficult because you have to be a party you it's like you're always working you knowIndian you have to talk to everybody and for me that's not the case and like this anyway I am always talking to people I have no inhibition and going up to a person in starting conversation and never like I will wait for this person will come talk to me know why I am I would add other people's person have always been a people person I talk to everybody unless I don't want to that if I don't want to like I don't like that the different thing with people using a people person pays off the most in your careerin my career but ok I am working like you know Black working in a group work with people all that always the important here is very important that I never studied journalism I never wanted to be a journalist are not qualified to be one I didn't want to be called one because it sometimes it comes with a negative connotation because then you sound like this person who is always looking for a story not my wife I host Talk Show withfriendly Vibe whatever you call it a version of Koffee with Karan what you say that I'm not owned by a people actually go into the details of it this is fine but but life of me I want that when he Vibe and so because thankfully I am a peoplesgood with communication and the language and ok with you always have always been very good people people like most fans and media industry in the first place I made them through the show that a lot of the actress who came on the show and your children and like to be doing this because we got log I think it's always been that but like now a lot of other friends and I made that now they become very good nowlike I've seen all with you know I've seen them struggle life seen them like get a first movie of drop them to the airport with a living so now that that way but like yeah you want I want to believe that have a lot of influence but like I don't know men like it I thinkcome from a genuine place also thank you for this beautiful brobeautiful episode bro thank you I had fun to get cup

August so 49 I don't know I will sometimes you feel you know that you leave more more than half your life so I wake up sometimes in the morning thinking what exactly do I want her to leave the rest of my existence is it to I want to be on a film set all the time don't be on holiday more how do I you know I want to spend this time and I am in the answers are come up with thefamily and friends base but another nice mixer what is everything confronting mortality and thinking about thinking but pretty serious things like reading your reading is is everything everything also gives me great great happiness are you good manners website of yes I am coming I am quite satisfied in and released taken happy with I'm happy with Ameen Ameen you know I am not read it but I'm always looking to doslightly better working on a slow learner and I'm still learning and still end up getting better at at acting and life so you know the better you get it at these things the the kind of more you enjoy it so I am enjoying it is sleeping like stuff like this scene your kind of content get slightly darker slightly 800 I don't know I think I'd probably should be a bit more commercial but but we will love this but I don't know I can't look itthe stuff that's really commercial and I feel like I really don't want to watch it so I don't know I don't mean to be judged on that but I think it is a middle ground it like to be a little more commercial ad like I don't want to do films that that people don't watch you know but but I think this is a common ground terminal of the 2 film like you know I think that gully boys own Kind of Place intellectual as well as not to intellectual even be justly Logistic and nice lookingand you know what a good films that moves you yet but that isn't kind of demented hopefully if someone studies your kar you did notice that you will be patient with like picking your nose like all your holes have like this little bit of in the available it is especially in the face review growing up your kind of consciously remodeling yourself in every face that what I felt I think is balance you know you can you can add depends on your Outlook and what you want in life in ArmyWhere are influences are from what drives us in what we think is beautiful images all constructs that kind of work created in your childhood with your experiences so they feel that I've grown up with a certain things that I've watched and I like like I mean if you asked awkward Lal kaptan am in a wooded underwear and grown up watching 20 students understand the relevance of wearing like a red East India Company jacket for riding a horse in the desert these are things that you know and actor with mylog what kind of give his it to conduct do you know but a someone is my city differently and and and would rather do you know Housefull for example you know which is great man in that that diversity is what makes industry interesting is looking my question to you is how close is this film to your heart is coming after sacred games you know it's really close to mybeen like a passion project it was like so hard white and black embroidered festival is like its Western the kind of Filmi days I mean when I say Western is not like a copy of a guy had Indian stories like Indian superhero like mobeen Indian superhero Naga Sadhu is a great and you know amazing but his kind of like a mix of a lot of Western superheroes where is this guyIleana D'Cruz Indian Army first what is not really Supernatural event the standard looks Dominican jump over buildings and stuff but he's a swordsman and if you've seen the Japanese Japanese kind of influence in terms of Samurai influence in the fighting and stuff like this the fact it is a Sadhu on the fact is this makes the East India Company time that this film is Saturn is a fascinating time is required within the wild Western live without being boring bam in the Mughal Empire is collapsing this will pocketsweather report of everyone all over India flight the badlands you can ride a horse from one account to another without getting attacked by bandits or something and it looked like the Wild West what is India so we drive black for 5 hours to find the most rugged landscape we can find believe it take this really bad as film crew and go out there and make this movie so I mean you need to be a little crazy little thing that I was looking for this beautiful it so very short and considering the budget we had to actually put this thingI what happens to this at the box office I will like the proud forever that you know I was on this film you know your DP in history and I think that's a big reason this film is cannot close to your heart touching to you is like of all the history you've read and agree to a lot was like 3 lessons have stayed with you want change you will be the person 3 lessons history one thing is I think and learn Nothing from history except that Manga learn Nothing from his and harm you know it can repeats itself for sure if youspecific you know where with our lessons history Amit so many things that come in the UNO the life as it usually has a good fat and bad 50 and you know things change with coronavirus in the sense it is important to recognise what the good times are because when you look at a person's history is the seven years with the best years of his life and you can recognise that what is happeningI sincerely believe that the best face of a about to come up so yes I feel tired generation is really looks up to look up your classmates and the kind of content you select this is very tired for like any good please don't see the movie is thatbook Sunny Deol ki picture bhai winners notes on show this all these great people have been lost but we get a chance to meet these people in history you know you can meet like you can like almost have a conversation with you know Plato and Alexander the great by reading the book so I will I feel like I'm at my dad I said to him answered your address is living alone I will put my mum is where something in Delhi and an easily get my books and fine so I understand that now booksyou never alone so I want to ask you how you this class is the electric Humko rules class no look up to be unaware of that sort of thing and and and yellow ki and kind of thing is to do with vcs kids and respect you know Yeh like this country so on the so much on penis in the people that work for the people the driver cause and stuff like that mean I get just constantly Kindermera mobile at least we can do is we can apply to both English to to everyone on and then I think my dad was like in ultimate this from your father if you respect him some people don't the join the taleban but you National and not a joke and I think giving respect to the coreclass Yeh yourself for life can I mean most people have have respect so and what about charm I don't know what I think this is taken as you know I don't know I should really try this I remember being a kid in and Lord girls telling me in Delhi that you like my brother and I should really upset and one summer think it just changed everythingcoronavirus is a bad thing is to be pretentious I think you get if I don't pretend this is filled with a lot of books in the head is better than you know Talking you will be careful who you are talking to daughter in law of it rubs off enough is the real life peoples cliche that you are known by the company you keep it right of the people around you so Aminis better or sometimes reading a book I feel that then you know just hanging out for the sake of but maybe you're lucky have five great nice people around them to get bored in Bollywood sometimes I get a little bit bored in in Bombay because I can't go out much in that nothing to eat celebrities the climate and is the fact that there is no park to feed the Ducks in our lives forever so we suffer on that level and it goes deep you know that means people can addicted motuInnova in social media in Indore things and become insulator anyone can we connect to each other sometimes that's all I've been reached their own but I am saying for me this business of not being able to walk down the road in a quiet there in the pub in the evening is less social so I can I can't get a bit bored and then I might be merely you know self-destructive bhajan couple of drinks in order to conductJa Chuke with you know I just notice that is happening because of boredom is that it didn't podcast maybe I just act in filmsnew kind of feel you know you and some kind of a difficult phase and life live it ok my bad 50 will never really in a friend of mine come in spend my wife's birthday with us in England recently and you is really like so comfortable and looked like he was in a lot so and so and his is not really Amin but he looked like he was really flamboyant uncomfortable and Happy Birthday am I've always been a littleeven though I am really privileged compared to a lot of people I feel good OL and you know I have a very strong sensitive and Doom a good good descended any moment so I am really not that comfortable and I haven't really ever been of even when the success was only know even when the success was on your like ok this is a face in a should perhaps it's because of understanding little bit about history that and I am also quite into mythology andmatson the Indian meals and all this construct a way that the Gods are watching you know so you should be too arrogant hubris and all that so so yeah it was tough am in the times but luckily I think I've always had a difference but your sites are you want to be in the greatest most successful act in Bombay than enough for be constantly be disappointed but I am constantly working and consider working so hard that balance even my wife has that balance is important that but II have always had a fairly steady and an interesting job no matter what will send it including sacred games every year the contents in changing getting better if you ask me are you happy being a night when you still 1995 and Basil making the same kind movies you know maybe not but luckily it's been like a gross V yah what men like the worst moment of your life worst moment of my life I got that it has been some run-ins with the lawyou know my father died that wasn't that wasn't very nice what it did you well that all this is going to end in a hospital room with tubes in you when does a trouble you it doesn't trouble me Bade makes me a where you know and I think about it and I just say ok so that's why I don't understand people who never think about it I think everything is actually driven byby the fact that we going to die another day we understand it or not that's why we like things on or not like things that should it all boils down to earth is great you are cause it's like a you capturing the moment in in filmora in or in not thought or alive in a painting or whatever you like freezing time and saying its kind of define is defining the Oblivion of time rate of deafkya do something that you may be lost if that was driving forces an active no I mean for myself I am I the only thing is to win vision eye twitching is the same is to do to a film that I can sit down at two in the morning and watch myself in all and se yah does regretted that an eye on steering Lal kaptan one of those sacred games one of those I don't know but so many of youslightly more gritty and all that you become slightly more great in your own life definitely I've also grown up in a roll like this I mean attached to the sound record is told me you are not sounding like the guy on day two at to go and work on it and I had bought a time in Rajasthan alone and I spent a lot of time alone just thinking thinking that this guys like like so they would like or dislike 20 stood by directors and Lesson No 9 is more likely it is to this is like a wolf in a country is very cool and lead magnetOutback pharrell and more wild lettuce things he's got that in all that how do you find that can get into that is what this means is also the films if I become like that people are writing more interesting stuff you know what is taught you I think is taught me humility and also procession of so many things are you slow down a little bit and the less I didn't like I was saying and you in a little moresending off of things around us to the thing you said about being slightly stressed all the time but you don't know when success Vilas menu bad there will start at reduced with it that happens to all of us men will I know if you're lucky you can do winner decent place with friends and family and I actually am I will on the kind of life I had an area where did you know you don't need so much money I mean after point c guys just being silly win in a with moneyis no end money.com I think in terms of education in terms of the many things that make you feel privileged on money like in education can make is a great privilege which I didn't think was a privilege when I was happening but it is like a many field if you like my driver had gone to that school maybeGalaxy of Britannia Dono so that that can sing is like crazy to think about Education Academy Dhol in your friend choices right now it's something like everything and everything you do your coloured by that kind of thing your value systematically you know some of these schools can really teach you about the important things in life also as you become more work to the great education so what is like to become a veryAnu videos and of Fame I don't think is Run Android no I don't think is useful at all I think it's in fact quite a hindrance and it's quite quite annoying unfortunately in India sometimes we have to be someone special in order to get things done normally if you just want to get things done normally it helps to tell somebody which is you sad but also love me let me tell you that you will find a lot of guys who like around my area will just be classy becoming be resilient well so thatok I mean if you do something and you spread the word then that's nice I mean to me personally I'd rather you know go to Goa and walk around without being nationally recognised I love being an address that you know this place is I can go was fine I just you know your Hangouts change but I think money can give you a lot of things that you think they may be done no I mean you know you likeanandashram let se missed Ambani something I am in you don't need to be famous mean you have the world at your feet Somani can also do that Fame is in fact A hindrance to to getting things done take away from your peace and show a little bit but it gives you is wave will weigh more I mean it's not this is the most important thing doesn't take away your please Hamen what you are why you should look for peace on Chaupati pure famoustomorrow's with Sarah Sarah you like coming of radon is becoming super famous advice to Ho like both in terms of a man in terms of career after point admin things change in Outlook exchange admin it is not so much advice really I had stood on pretty straight so I mean I just say the last time we are a chat about this was to be as he as original and just to be herself a known andenjoy the work in injoy acting and to think like a actor rather than then be too focused on want to be a star wars competition have a big part of your life like a big part of your mind and is especially early 2008 handover Zameen competition was important and I was in a big part of my life I realise once when you know when they rode Sanjay that went to jail meeting help me muchis the wishing ill on your own your enough doesn't help you the only thing that can really help you is is you doing better improving yourself competing with competing with yourself really sounds a bit boring but that's the best competition is the cal stars right vehicle stars meaning is a galaxy of stars is not called something that there's only one of a subject that means that everyone is appreciated by having their own way of doing things like as an actor you like thisthis is the same seen can be done so differently by different guys that difference is what makes it interesting sorry sir you know when I talked to the Sony layers of intellect I want you to give your top three book recommendations and then your top three learning at the top three books would be I think the fountainhead by Ayn Rand arey like PG Wodehouse and the jeeves and wooster storyvery funny and any collection of Ghost stories by Mr James what is at your mind with is it amazing atmosphere and reading if you're reading something you're interested in this is a whole process that happens is a connection to the words that are used the mental images that I worked in your mind this kind of like interaction between the brain and the page that is just I think it's the brain really interesting engaged in kitchen imaginationsimaginative and I mean in a cheaper than making a movie you can get an insight into a different world and and great writers and good writers with language then just create a certain within a certain kind of Style yeah you know like Mr Aman Henry James for example in an old is the great writers Dekho am in the classics these guys are unbelievable in terms of the atmosphereDeccan Jis create Charles Dickens example lemon and outstanding click today like at an almost 50 so how do you stimulators and mentally now there's so many things I'm in the used to being of a really interesting rolls films in and work is the main part of it like I know planning that can also in Planning a nice holiday with friends in and celebrating life in the right way with family in leg in a great PatluI'm looking for true I think balancing like a patch of hard work followed by a kind of celebration with kind of usually food and drink of some sort so you your really good and you deny yourself in the new and old doing something like it's like heavy and there is kind of like an animal that and you have to find that somewhere and once you find it I think to change diaperyeah in a sense and cracking back from the outdoor slightly different person people looking at me like you look different because you know you can change if you doing thing like this someone new movies with you forever I don't know I guess partially but you know they were always there is just another then your blood so you just have to magnify certain but something stay defence along it do it you know why should a young personit's cool Revenge drama that why at that we should go and see any film is because it's entertaining to watch as in you know it's like a really nice story but this is a unique film this Binu film that can a captures on its its lack of proper cinematic experience it on big screen today everyone's making CG movies and every weekend battle sequence looks the same with this in a crowd crowd multiplication techniques and it will also working history and I don't know what's going oninteresting movies Somewhere But this is like lekin Indian superhero got a set in a very real time with William Dalrymple just in the book The Anarchy synchronous call it like it was set in the Badland during during the Anarchy the on the cost of earth like judge Dredddirector to go to the spots in these locations in India where another been dead for hundreds of years to come alive on screen again is quite fascinating and my last segment of this podcast for you is something I can only ask you can have a conversation with you at this level what factors do the money do you make money so film over and then what do you invested I do it is a good question I don't know actors do I know a lot of people you don't ok tell you have a nice suspendedAmit always thought that in all and tomorrow Leke told you you think about money and losing money in Airtel something that guy just fell over you are right I mean that frightens me and where is me but doesn't completely surprised me with writing that can happen to anyone at any time so I spend more than half with and in case I don't fall over tomorrow I keep someone within I invested in a look after it oncan you keep things going and and money cannot be enjoyed without a certain Mara culture that much I can tell you what do you mean you everywhere like if you got cash admin how do you say how to convert that into enjoyment that conduit is is is culture because weather is listening to music whether it's like in a living in a nice drink or something good on you not going some interesting more watching something engaged in the sensor somehowwhat is no good in the bank basically if you need to give your sense of security and some people make the mistake because of the environmental even the most fun thing that they find to do is to make the money than a feeling of making it is what they live on which is not what I do so I really enjoy converting it into fun into experiences yes ok but in terms of your personal finances to invest in business is it right time in Udaipur it all in the Punjab National Bank will be in troubleprice in India cross between property and in certain there is safe stocks and shares in kind of banks that boring on the interest of solid things like that not I would get to adventurous with with the markets either so I will one hopes the economy will do well you know win over no diversity in investment beautiful and you learn that over timeexam one basket is what your talk with your care in reading this is not as and could you give if youyou know I think you find your location to find would really is called Location is from latin so it's like a voice that speaks to the tells you this is why you should be allowed people in

that morning is the kind of content that goes up on my Instagram on YouTube new thing as a content creator or an actress and actor first always because that's where I began everything that's what I absolutely love doingwhat do you think the event is one thing is that everyone and anyonehan compare yourself to anyone not in a larger picture to be honest dekh liya I will Lekar yaar Achcha

project your good read of vibes in function on why I think and that's foolproof method of you know being comfortable in life making our life goes in the right directionso Ok Love Me Love Me Say That This your very dedicated about your Instagram like you had an alarm on your phone Rang it is 6:30 alarm that you also like to study and you have to study Everything I Do I Do Itlike being prepared for

I like you read my visa leave I like howthey use it like you can spot honesty and someone smile or even sportlife Ek Nazar you can tell so my question to you is that do you agree that in the whole world is really happy that usually Babli rose in your acting eggs and all that I believe I am happy inside because again you need to find happiness from within you can't like based on an external factor ki aadami ko film Mil Gai I'll be happyAgar Main Koi Mil Gaya I'll be happy you need to be happy and that was going to attract good things to you to people were listening to this and don't even know the meaning of the word Vibes can you explain in your own words what is this wife kya hoti hai hoti hai aapka aura jo aap energy is you give out everyone roams around with these energies that are constantly like around you right to Jab do log Milte Hain they have an exchange of energy and that's what the Biblelike the the energy you give out and the energy you are capable of receiving a persevering is a Vibe just a moment of your life of my life is actually I passed away with my brother and a lot of people make fun of dog owners calling their pets their family but like what I have tattoo in his name but I think losing himRobin the most possible thing in my life which we had adopted because he had been checked out of his previous house because he was that kamina so they were just like what is this is why do you thinkunderstand what gets into a human being when they do any form of cruelty and this is not like this is such like everyday phenomenon that phenomenon that like people don't think like Diwali ke time per to is the worst for any animal in the City 2 kilo pagal ho jata hai I don't know like to answer your question I don't know what gets into people what triggers the main thing is that on happiness and that toxicity within your cellthat comes out in ways and it comes out on people and things that can't really fight back on your own size than capable of taking someone their own size and that's why they take it out on animals who can't really say anything they just have to suffer about relationships also that in the first two years will be the honeymoon failures very good 3rd 4th year if you have any unresolved issue inside you in terms of these projections on the other personwhat you won't leave you there with you now they are granted wala granted by projecting on them matlab if anything going wrong in your life your boss about it you can go into relationship news out of them for something stupid can be avoided this place Tango and always do you think people like so insecure boyfriends adjust project chalo insecure girlfriends I just projecting the in security on the partner for boyfriends and insecure girla result of bad parenting so not bad pending but like you know ignorant parents like to hear more about this so if you have daddy issues as a girl growing up and all your life you not been that lost your dad you been close your mood is not been close your dad like that comes from office but isn't always like working on it doesn't want to talk too muchwithout that you've always kind of Subway wanted some kind of father figure in your life when you get that boyfriend who is your love he loves you he does a lot for you somewhere you start feeling of that avoid that he knew that that boyfriend energy and then once that energy is yours because you never experience it in your life is like the of the first time we were eating like chocolate cake in your life you ever had the taste of chocolate name of the firstchocolaty cake become so nice and then sometimes it sometimes it might become a relationship that these are some issues or it could be in the case of you have a lot of Indian guys want comfortable with things that their girlfriends main going out to how many weather of some kind of childhood experience that may be that guy is father has told his mother thatsocialization basically growing up to grow up seeing it becomes a part of your personality and very importantly the way you react to situations the way you behave in a relationship the way you treat the opposite sex it's usually a lesson you learn from the way you seen your parents and track your order talk in their interaction you think whatever they are doing is the rule of the world absolutelythat number 71 Baleshwar accept I am give Gyan ok I want to ask you how ambitious are you as a person have noticed whenever I have tried being ambitious if not worked out for me whenever I have just you know it's as stereotypical as it sounds but Karm karo fal Ki Chinta mat karo vah aap karte ho naactually like things work in your favour I wouldn't say I am very impressed you work toward some long-term vision and long term goals so it's always just you know I am doing it might be achievable short term goals that come again it need not be a quarterly goal or monthly Gola soul won gold can be like in the next week I need to achieve this goal or it can be over for example so before I started doing all this troublethen started travelling a lot and you know as a profession as my work I worked really hard for that so that was my longest term goal of probably had to have a something I've been wanting to do ever since I was in school you wanted to make money of travel blogging living like a sustainable comfortable living of travelling now this need not be travel blogging so when I was in school again when someone asks what's your dream project as an actorAshoka host not India typing international travel that was always so like that would I always works towards and that's what happened like it you became that in a form and I didn't realise was now when I meet my friends and maybe some people I meet after a long time they do your finally doing what you want itthat vocal about the goal clearly on most everyone I had told ya Mujhe travel karna yaar mujhe travel karna ideas for a travel the world I just want to travel the world and without realising it said it to so many people know that when it's actually happening its become a reality when I meet people later and their tell me your to the happen that this yes manifest everything happenwe too small for Universe to give a damn about every single thing individually unless you don't actively what is this formula for success what your own personal formula what have you done right and I know that knowing you a very organised personAnita this this thing these 5 things are not be fine I think promptness what do you mean just don't procrastinate execution and being from an execution don't think ki Maya call karungi karungi mere pass abhi do Ghanta free time in my schedule for something new to come my schedules not blocked by somethingyou know you know what they say about how to spot a potentially successful kid you see what all the kids plate when he's eating food how he give give give cake at the end of it and also give

this while ensuring that only to yourself when it comes to thethat's what is not just for this for everything that the formula for saying happy that the formula for being successful that the formula of having X Factor that that the formula of having a good relationship a good marriage good anything what your definition of a good relationshipboth sides respect what the other person said I feel there is no respect now like a one person feel that the person is better than the other that's an issue but if both respect each other and with that person on a very very very minute level as well explained that I don't knowexplain with Spark on the spark is true it happens and in conversation for you look for in a relationship you should be able to talk about anything something as frivolous are the shape of your Poop do something as deep as what is this thing that keep my feeling like this today and like I should just be able to go with my partner that he should know menot well that ok bye I am I feeling this and I think also when both side help each other grow like it's not like ki and benefit from your can benefit from me know it should just be a very natural process where you just every single day making Each Other a better person and collectively becoming better people and I feel if you are not becoming a better person like if being with a person in a relationship does not make you a better personmain kyu worst person that the toxic relationship you had any in your life romantic relationships actually have it installed into Bulshit so I had like boyfriend in the past it started Kiya don't talk to this boy don't that shoesthank you but in terms of relationship and your Kariyo when you know one of the partners careers flying so much do things possible for the other partners curiosity fly at the same Pace and them to Bounce office of that both if you're lucky you and your partner will have a similar cycle but if you are unlucky on unlucky minutes it life it happenPeene similar cycle and that suggested that in that respect coming comes into being that if my Carriers flying of my partner's Carriers flying that position of said disrespecting the other person thinking Loli of the other person as sorry but it's also very important ki the person was graphviz abhi going on a lake having a downward slope that person should be strong enough to accept appreciate support and encourage the person who is on a height of a graphsecure yes 27 and it will save your 1920 so how is your opinion on relationships change now compared to then what is the difference in relationshipsok I might not be the best person to answer this is my boyfriend have been together for 6 years so you kind of ok I mean I was 2122 this is that if you know sound for 7 years agooh ho best ok I'm traveling still has a lot of money and most of that money has gone into a property kutte Billi also be able to chill there and I should have a room where like the lots of puppies were growing up because enquire se bahar nikal in APgo inside that puppy room and you can trust that might be absolutely absolutely save value savings when you can save not the cause of being confused meeting a lot of people around them and your younger than youand as many people not saving the money not taking care of the money do you see this happening happening its not being able to be prepared for it kind of wrong parenting wrong friends over 2,000 people think things so I am from so and so community we don't save anyway so light like that the magnetic that's limitinggive us 937 my dad he believes in investment so he told me from a very young age like it's been or dinner table conversation since we were alike and 4th 5th standard could be karlo always a 50% of their income always say 50% of their income and the remaining 50% Ghar chalo jo bhi kharche karo karo I don't don't everfun but at the same time don't suffer the Stewart and always know that only know the value of money as much money comes but know the value of 100 rupees and another thing that I learnt again and this is actually from my boyfriend for my partner that money has different values for different people and we all know this but we never felt so stop bargaining withWindows aur Diwali Mein lanterns taxiwala again because thankfully the value of A Hundred rupee note for you and we will be different than the taxiwala holds values that hundred Rupees note so you just like be mindful of the value of money also even now I'm sure you follow that 50% rule somewhere safe more than 50% of given numberlive with my parents mera kharcha kya hai like you understand like a personal finances and you absolutely give and I am asking the questions you can put the information out too young 26 just don't get them what is a good start money if you hadn't mentioned that families who don't get them is take your parents advicewhen it comes to money because maybe in other things you might be you might think you smarter than you know because every generation is no so many more things because of exposure but things like money at issue trust your parents and their better judgement as opposed to because if especially if at a young age you have been lucky enough to make some money for yourself up 21 year ki age me your never gonna be able to value that money on know what to do with that moneyif your family is actually guiding you definitely papaya mummy Jo Bhi Karte Hain baat suno you might not like it then ki you can't buy a car that you like oh you can't buy the designer bag that you like but you can leave that money and you cannot Thank your dad or mum letter which is my case personally but if your family does not like get into this so whatever you know I think it's always good to professionally find someone who can advise you on how to invest your money and I thinkshort term and long term safe and high risk investments are a very very smart idea of how you divide your own money can you give out your investments are spread of save around 60% I personally use viral money but the devices organisation is all the more you can I invest through the devices organisation for 60% is always a 40% is running the show and alsoif I'm buying likes your t-shirt or something it can my Costume for what I wear online at put a big chunk of it in a Portfolio management company same like it's easy and creative people you don't want to be in the middle of a final no problem if you do but it is easier to put all your good trusted Portfolio Management Service allows you do it yourself but so I put a big chunk of money in the portfolio managerShubh and and the ruler Portfolio Management services that one is too many of them to don't just semester money easily do a lot of reasons behind that one is a trusted by your family has worked with something then it can even better case and kind of keep tabs on what they are doing with your money also don't just leave it and forget this just had an idea of what happening deep into it and then I divide sum of the recipient in the usual fixed deposits and mutual funds and I have a chunk of itkeep on the side and I give to some of my friends who are just starting out their own versions of Portfolio Management Services so they are also many hours a very small person to something I didn't like easily afford to lose that my high risk high return but how would you like what you do something very similar never put all your eggs in one basket never put all your eggs in one basket sorry I forgot to mention this because of business of the amount of moneythe DSR Dhoni always gone back my businesses always like this and I office is everything is bootstrap like we did not taken any blown from anyone we were taken 1 Rupee to an appearance is always any virus coming in the first mentality is how much money do you need to throw back into the business to make things grow and also going forward I am I have a huge business plan was next to the told you what Vijayakanth awkward on camera in the night they are very capital intensive require a lot Manisha almost any money reviewfirst hun just that way it got to go back in in saying that like this YouTube world and all is very nice why is rewarding like you get to travel a lot you get to know a great experience is nothing nothing lacking in my life but that's because I'm very careful with how the money is divided not coming but you honestly it's what you do is a very safe and a wise way of using your moneyenormously apart from investing in other people's portfolio manager electro smaller ones that were a little percentage that you do apart from that it's almost the same manner as our Singh never put your eggs in one basket and hear that that's kind of what I do like that nothing new or anything you didn't study finance right no no I didn't study final papa Kisi Ko do you learn from your dad your dad guide you please I'm still learning god is still teaching me like I am stillin fact she encourages me to sit with him at least once a month and he takes me through what is invested where and why this is invested your and why it was not invested their at this particular time and all of that so you take me through another thing I wanted to mention when you brought up saying that keep a tab on your long-term investments don't just forget them so I had an experience with that again office in any names but it was one of those long termmain things and I realise that I'm obviously in the long term investment value depreciates and then goes up on a regular basis but would appreciate it was no effort it was not going up only and when you ask for the statements and everything the first statement that were being printed and given to me and like and it was the singer was a certain amount of money going every you're into that you know that scheme the policy and had not seen it I don't know what would have been the thing at the end of this methodyeah so and very honest I didn't get my dad so it but that's why I am saying I'm still learning that happened and mindful of it and that again I I mention this because it completely ties in with what you said that Dal ke bhul mat Jao Tum thoda kam hai but yaar you work so hard for that your present what other financial learning that we had just like this this is all I knowdivide your eggs in one basket just ask your elders learn about from the you don't need a study study personal finance or something to start start somewhere at how little you are absolutely save as much as you canI want to invest in mutual fund of fixed deposit how do you go about that process I personally ask my Gujarati friends why my co-founder sitting down stairsbut you also keeps track of the financial Markets and what happening what new things are coming what new policies are there what new schemes are there are others that is that so he is the one I asked have you ever thought of investing in startups going forward I actually wanted to I had but like it was in convincing enough to nahin kiya maine to yourself into just need to be very convinced that the CIDan investor like a again if not God like the right kind of like the product has appealed to me so much for visiting the message of their influences in this country are ready to invest in startups it's a good idea my way of investing in a certain we have around 40 people working in both organisations so any kind of startup idea that any of the kids have always made sure that just bring it up and will build togetherkind of investing your time money is required by a very open investing money but definitely willingness a time of leadership solutely also the world of YouTube the world of influences the world of everything with a lot of life lessons business because we meet so many people and like so many different kinds of people from different places and everything so I think just like your brain activeI have this tradition of when we have a way back to coming on the borders between only as till now or continuous operation we always talk about romance and attraction is a big part of the cast actors have to think about romance and always more than the average person know your dating someone to activate that modekind of you forget we don't actually love this person that you love them so actor actively think a lot more about love romance attraction the right that so I know you been a success but say tomorrow would become single at this stage of your life what would you look for in a potential guy as a potential buttonlet you know someone is capable of having a conversation like you and I just had so like someone who is like what I do I can't think of any but like someone who just at the same space in life that I am who I can have those conversations with and who helps me feel like I am of work now you can switch off into that person to keep the very important thing is soimportant that your partner should be social ok I am very social I am very social so for me I need my partner also be social like I do want to go to a party and have to babysit my partner ki baat kar raha hai people are talking to him by social you mean good like social skills not like sorry rephrase that someone was good social skills need not necessarily be like a influenzahumour and just generally had doesn't tell me use ladke se baat mat karbecause even I am not toxic one month and Vitamin D3 and half yours like so bad question thanks thanks a lot but this is aboutcal mujhse baat aur let's let's call him Pinku Pinku Pinku Pinku Pinku so what what a big toners for you like would you describe Pinku a Lil bit more in detail like one of the deal breaker this very insecure and likes me having toreset your not respecting someone like I think respect is so important to someone does not respect me I can not respect that person back to you when I have the remotest meaning of affection for that person read out one very deep learning I had yesterday from one mentors and that it's not easy to understand I was reading the 34 time at a very simple statement unko Samjha Dena ok reader of its very happy for this podcast also so this from Manish Pandey who is like basically be done podcast with anyonelearn it guys I come across in my life ok I found a review on Twitter at join to Manish beautiful statement without trust communication breaks his why in any human interaction the required amount of communication is inversely proportional to the level of Trust which means if there's very little trust you require talking a lot more attention more listen call meparty ok but it does a lot of Trust when you require less communication you require less listen any to see you very often and in order for us to be there a person is to love themselves a lot for sale of themselves will trust you even talking about throughout this podcast that it's all what's inside that you project that so beautiful that so beautiful thing is also those little unsaid things in a relationshipso special and that's what differentiate that your partner from your closest friends in one of the breakup se had I was feeling bad about it and a friend of mine came up to me he said that to you know remember that when you break up is difficult to get over the person who is good looking very smart but because of the little things like the way the person laughed the weather was reacted with an extract the head is like you but life is long and9 people out there and I think there is a double soulmates I think that there are Soulmate in the world and also gana yoga school I go to whole chapter about soul mates and all that good feel good chapter should be used only when you have money then you can actGod help other people in of comfort to give a lot of your energy to the spiritual growth as well but coming back to romance some other than like so you spoke about really I think about what you look for in a guy is it true that most girls don't really look at the looks of a person and look forward Deepa definitely on the same most guys a very low Korean it is a very visual it just how many many brains hardwarecommenting in YouTube at least a certain level of ok but that's not true for girls like Asin especially Indian go look for depth look for the mine look for conversation would you agree that the answer to what you ask me some time but you arewhat's the difference What are difference would be between a 21 year when between relationship and if anyone has any 28 years I think is this because when you ask that young and when you Stayed Out of college it might be more for the looks but as you Metro run as if she were actually matters in life that does that takes a backseat that's not the priority anymore so I think it just comes from a place of maturity and assessee was never grow up so that yousomewhere is wrong but I feel all guys kind of look for mum in a relationship allnow what you like romantic advice for the world like what one you think you done correct romantically very honestly it again just being true to myself on being true to how I felt about this person not showing up on the always always in life everyone Learns from trial and error so when Pinku happened I was with Pinku for a good to yours and I didn't want to be with Pinku but I just didn't have the balls to go and tell Pinku the listen broso I think I'm just being true to yourself and I think have been true to myself and not put up with it and that's what I think as and being respectful again like I can't say enough how important respect is 12th 51 respectful in a relation to an honest helier screw everything else honest that your ground rules for earlier and write in a relationship in everypossible level High Court and I think in every possible way possible only like a mistake you communication also like to communicate adornis absolutely why do people cheat I think this was not meant to be due believer I believe that men and women are supposed to be polyamorouspoly poly poly Andreas polyamorous body what you think of that thing of that they do that biologically I don't know if humans like there or didn't do that but in my opinion it is something that was made like a hard and fast rule onlytrue society Answer all the you know social checks and the norms and values and the Ideal Idea systems and all of that but yeah I don't think we were supposed to be like humans are supposed to be free and let you know create stuff because they had that mental capability of creating stuff but things are the future there is too much freedom is sometimes detrimental so I think that's why society imposed having you know partner'sMera sochna but it is because of this it's probably in your DNA and lack of spine to be honest you are not like strong enough to believe in you know your relationship or to control yourself at least it's the worst when addressing a lot of cheating happening around me is the worst when one person really strong and believes a lot and it and one weak person likeBataye Bina line line line about it hiding everything in hiding is a lie uniform let's let's reference Sankat Pinky in my lino Pinky Pinky Pinky Pinky right now now that happened but you know what the worst possible breakupif it doesn't kill you makes you stronger and stronger thank you for being on the subscribe to the YouTube channel andare you right now thank you so much for having me this was such so much fun and it was so nice to be able to have this conversation and know that there are more people in your Universe like in your work universe and any work space around your age and to know more and more people believe things that you believe in and at the end of the day is this one principle that we are allabout in our own ways and different ways and meditation yoga by religion is a one principle and I like it just makes me so happy that more and more people are connecting to that one friend and you are so like strongly connected to the principal of the world is heading and as influences its kind of duty to put it out there is a big reason is that this Potter put out positivity so if you're listening to this on your way to the office I hope you have a super positive dayinfluencers it's kind of duty to print out there is a big reason is that the spot on for about positivity so if you're listening to this on your way to the office I hope you have a super positive day so from the two most positive social media feeds in the business of you later"

special of the Ranveer show actually got my cousin to record this one because the entire team is spread all over the city going about the remote work culture super today's episode of thought everyone that home every one's looking for content recommendations and also you I believe that when it comes to content should only invest your time in content is it good to stay with you after may be sure to of watching of consuming that kind of content just like the Ranbir show at they were talking about my topmind king movies that right mind in movies and if you watch one should probably stay with the rest of your life and the reason I want include these on the Ranveer show is because I feel that if you listen of this podcast you are deep thinker you analyse everything that you consume keeping that in mind these are my quick 10 recommendations at number 10 a very common mind and Recommendation its Shutter Island starring Leonardo DiCaprio Shutter Island is amovie about a mental Asylum about a detective who reaches the mental Asylum in order to solve a mystery and figures even more mysteries about the island that the mental Asylum is located on one full movies that will keep you grip throughout that scare you and at the end of the movie was a twist involved and the twist will kind of measure your head even more than one of those Leonardo DiCaprio movies that I will scandal underrated that more people need to what ok numberKeeping It much lighter Inside Out animated Pixar movie it basically about a girl and your usual Priti and problems but from the perspective of your soul your spirit your mood your ego your emotions you know usually animated movies of characters with a problem and meet an insect or a bird or you know living being like that sure the animated objects are all theemotions for angle is shown as one of the characters what love is shown as one of the characters embarrassment shown as 1 characters ego soon as one of the characters in the movie is added to analyse yourself a lot and the some stories and some concepts that can only be explained through animation to other than the movie up by Pixar which impacted me on a deep romantic level this is that one movie with animated with recommend to all my friends and spalist of the Ranveer show with all of your love deep thinkers ok next movie recommendation we got the shining starring Jack Nicholson it is a horror movie but is not horror movie just goes so much does it not just got jump scares the shining as a classical when it comes to film making it also analyse human spirit and especially during this phase of warrant and this one will talk to you what I recommend that you don't know what is movie if someone is staying alone but some on staying with your family watch it is one of those forumthat would definitely should what especially enjoys film in general the lord be glued don't watch horror movies because I don't want it to stay with them at night this isn't one of those horror movies this doesn't have really scary scene doesn't like a few it has mind bending seems some of the scene the Soviet some of the things that happen the story of so beard at the weirdness of the movie stays with you and is a Cult classic square as a human being at your responsibility to watch the shining ok next one you havesad breakup part number 7 we have Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind if you drifted away from a close friend from a close family member of course from someone you loved a lot at some point in your life the Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind starting Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet will help you will help you analyse yourself will help you think about love from a third-person perspective from macro perspective we look at the whole concept of love from a top view it will really make you understandbreakup better understand the Dynamics of a baby breakup better if you just had a break up this movie might hurt you little bit but if you only in the process of healing and you just want someone to help in the healing process I do believe that this movie will help you a bit of the director has kind of short analyst range with a dive into Jim Carrey is mined in this movie where he's had a break up with someone and it's time to erase the memories of that person so it moviemess with how you perceive your memories about that person who you love the person who you were close to at one point in your life definitely should watch it especially if you enjoy a slightly different filmmaking ok my next recommendation at Number 6 very good movie called get out again it's slightly horror movie slightly horror movie it not an alarm horror movie Darna goes the Monsters but it is one full movies that stays with youSBT head I don't wanna talk much about it because it's one of those movies where you should just let the movie speak for itself will tell you this is directed by Jordan Peele he used to run a comedy show it still runs one called Key and Peele you find fantastic Key and Peele videos on YouTube Sofia I will just for you know fooling around with just one great comedy Kaun and short and beautiful look for Key and Peele videos in YouTube the same guy has gone and directed this movie so it is a scary moviemind bending movie but it will also make you laugh a lot and will stay with you and it was movies you can watch like 56 times and never get bored of a highly highly recommended that you want to get out at number 57 all horror movie and open recommending a lot of horror movies bridal you what the reason I recommend horror movies because they stay with you good horror movies are usually built on very mind bending concepts that make you look at society in a different way that can expose the evilspeople feel about ghost Monsters and evils rather than being afraid of the ones on the outside should be afraid of the ones on the inside is very nice Dadaji line for you guys but even when it comes to the devil is about 5 people stuck in an elevator and one of them is the devil The Devil's Satan movies about how they figure out who's the devil inside the elevator and how each of them slowly start dying to the process of figuring thatabout it will teach you about life I don't think this movie did to help those under 88 lasix it will scare you in some parts do not watch it if you don't enjoy horror movies what get out and the shining instead of the three get it is really scary next shining than this one devil next 4th this was kind of common but I do feel as one knows movies and if you walk again and again it teach you something new it make you understand movie Deepa I will start making you questionyour mind works and the way your dreams work movies called Inception according to any one of Christopher Nolan best movies of Christopher Nolan is possibly the best director award time I know that we got arguments like you know Scorsese is a better director or you know Quentin Tarantino better director I genuinely feel like Christopher Nolan and is an abscessed directive and this is the piece of work of his by his foot the most of himself into itkind of constructed this elaborate story is called Inception for a reason it's about dreams about the world of dream that about lucid dreaming being in control of your dreams entering other people's dreams very complicated movie you have to watch this with subtitles on if you or someone who really enjoys investing time in a movie in order to exercise your mind watch this movie if you haven't watched it already very entertaining area was movie 1020 xusually I am dating anyone I am sure that this is the movie and show them if they haven't seen it already because I know that deep conversation and you like deep conversation he probably like superdeep movies is one of the entire listed in this movie is the deepest one again next one another Christopher Nolan classic which will mess with your head which is probably as difficult to understand as Inception it interstellar It's About Time Travel is about space travel with about Blackand it is about the dimension beyond hours by that I mean that human beings live in a 3D dimension where there is length that is breath that is height ok so if there's an object and purpose of phones it has a length that has breath it has thickness of height now human beings the way our minds are built we are not capable of understanding a dimension beyond the three dimensionsinterstellar talks about the dimension beyond the three dimensions and the dimension is called time is one of the things that retain from interstellar of the talk about time as a linear kaun sa that means you can go backwards in time you can go forward in time so the year 1999 is happening at the same time that 2020 is happening bridges different perspective because our minds and developed in a week and only perceive 2020 as a moment of time that happening right now but right now 1999 is happysame time did you get it no don't worry about it watch interstellar and then listen to the podcast again so I get one Melissa no one move you on this podcast and you understand this statement matter trust me will start receiving the world in a different way and a lot of the logic used in interstellar is also spoken about in the world of yoga as a way to understand and start perceive in the fourth dimension as a dimension beyond the three that we knownow where at the top of a list number 2 and number one of the two movies that had a very deep impact on at least struggle to place the I didn't know which one I should keep a number to which one should keep at number one number to another underrated movie it become a TV classic Disney shows a lot on television sets all over the world it called the curious case of benjamin button starring Brad Pitt it is a slightlymovie about a guy who is born old when he was born you had the physical appearance on the physical features of a really old man and throughout the entire life he ages backwards is an incredible concept when you think about it honestly it's one of those movies where you you start living Brad Pitt's life is playing benjamin button in the movie and the way they were directed the way that shown the way his life and you start putting yourselfin his mind within the movie it is backwards ok but the end of his life we actually become thin in front and throughout the length of his life he actually falls in love with this lady who is normal she is born as a normal person and she grows old why she is growing old he is growing young and that dynamic really message with your head at the very few Historical events in the movie really message with you at the vedic show that society treats him really message with your head at the end of the movie some of the scenesstay with you for life at the end of his life when is remembering all the amazing characters edema throughout his life that something that is tailored to the coming at state with me that movie I do that moment you and the final movie unlike most of the night in movies abhi spoken about in this list the final movie is a commercially very successful movie stars Jim Carrey squad Bruce Almighty about a guy who meets God one day god is played by Morgan Freeman and got S brusali in WhatsApptime you get to be God you have all my power Socha regular guy who is kind of fallen out of love with his own life and get all of God's powers and therefore gets a lot of perspective on the world and realises how small is in the big bad word that we know it the movie that solves a 10 year old and honestly I felt like I was 18 years before that I didn't understand the concept of God but I'd genuinely feel it doesn't believe in god that fine this movie willquestion that concept of a higher power is there something beyond humans but I strongly believe there is by the way you would have guessed that by watching the pot prastav this point but highly recommended if you haven't seen the movie it also extremely funny and those are the best kind mind movies Everything does not be serious it can measure your head and at the same time it can entertain you like crazy so that was the short episode

you cannot let your mind control that side of you there is no stopping you for any think a lot of scientific studies have also started saying that holding back your semen ritek retaining the semen is actually good for health and Molecular give it a shot what's the worst that could happen + more than anything I wanted to practice myvilpowerok Viraj Sheth how is your 200 day nofap challenge to yourself BinI think your lockdown is pretty much been about you and your own body parts that I am asking you how has your 200 days nofap challenge women power started before something else 40 days intoPM Modi in the balance as it know we will stay at home so so that actually you know it was two sides of right it should either have made it difficult for me to continue the nofap because you know how it is right with the moment we started our homes and we have 24 hours to ourselves Pizza touching certain body parts which is happening toa lot of the kids in office actually yes this is an active conversation the sum of the boys in office have with each other for those who don't know or no Fab is by this point is basically abstinence staying away from masturbation stay away from sex you got any stay away from sex during lockdown what is basically staying away from masturbating which village has done very successfully for 2:00 p.m. todaythe form of nofap following is that the many forms but basically the one I am for what do you mean many forms I mean certain people look at nofap as ok no Pon no masturbation and Europe sexual intercourses is alright my version of it is clearly because I don't have the relationship right now it is no sex no masturbation anddo intercourse basically collation of your you know vital fluid of 1 mm of your sperm ok nice happens that we are running jogin office where I always to everyone that Viraj the name Viraj actually mean semen and varieties retailing is Viraj no it's notshort detail podcast with Mr Sarvesh Shashi who has actually been on nofap journey fighting 9 years or something now and it's possible benefits and helps increase your focus it helps kind of your sleep pattern that help to overall Physical health as well it helps Your mental health and mental fitness levels as well but I feel when people watch a podcast of someone who is under 19 years the kind of thing that state ofking is out of reach that I wanted to do this conversation with you you are an engineering bro Aisi new growing up I am seeing you know your body part becoming wider and bigger through the years to Virajpet at this stage of life why did you choose to take up nofap is it because of the entrepreneurial pressure you have in your life ok I wanna wanna Baje neural bit people think that I am a co-founder of Monkey which I ambirthday shows primarily run by this guy by Jhalak Raval a lot of the pressures on these two people have seen them grows on the nose and a big part of your growth as an entrepreneur are the personal challenges you put on yourself in your personal life outside of business Yeshu the study business better if the study finances better but you also really have to level up in certain personal aspects of your life to form habits thatif you maximize your potential so do like did you take up nofap keeping that maximizing your potential Vibe in mind because I've got my own tension that beerbiceps and you know to create all these videos and kind of balance out the bit of work have a monkey I try kind of solid define all my habits why did you select no Papa as your way to gotwo of these experimental in nature right and approval is especially after starting the startup that at as a person I want to experiment with a bunch of things and a low-fat has always been the sword of a cult of you know movement that have been started by a lot of people in the West it Trickle down your as well as European top 5 podcasts on this fit Tuber spoken awarded Sarvesh spoken about it and I was a newbenefits to it up forever practice state as always all good things to talk about it whoever goes against it is University of is to provide science and black my personal belief is that an ammeter to Pro science Honours at extreme Pro like you know aukat spirituality like they should always be like a balance between the two there are certain things that science yes has proven right and there are many things that has not evenEurope which many of those have been shot of the explain by the Hindu box original of the religious books in the happened to discover that and it both ways now a lot of scientific studies have also started saying that Europe Europe holding back your semen ritek retaining the semen is actually good for health and give it a shot what's the worst that could happen + more than anything I've wanted to practice myvilpowerbecause I wanted to challenge my own self and understand what is the limit I can go to how much can I control my own emotions my own words is my own brain and more than anything that will help me it doesn't matter by pics energy tomorrow because of nofap or not he doesn't matter if I am you know doing better off because of nofap my manifestation is better because of nofap for not what matters I could practice myaur and put it into implementation because this is one of the strongest causes that humans have you know sex is one of the biggest urges that people have and if you can not let your mind control that side of you there is no stopping you for anything you know for a fact that is of major reason why I went to it went into it and I mean it was difficult to start with honestly I have had faces where200 days right from the beginning right I had many faces where after 10 days a week after 15 days move to a month before 60 days proconnect think like that to my like to send you that would be don't push directly for a 200 a girl for 15 days from today I will stop it though it may not be entirely possible take take a step towards it and you build your willpower toit's like you instead of directly going into a final championship match play with the rookies first europractice yourself go Lego 11 level of and then go for the fines yeah I feel that a lot of people in all these meet and greet we do always ask me that dude how do you create the discipline within you how do you get yourself actually form a habit and this is what people don't understandall these personal battleship to select with yourself for example I feel even like starting to go through to the gym and sticking to that process really kind of work so will power an entire area which is 5 years long almost all the key moments in that carry on the ki habits are formed in order to forward my career I have originated from the world of physical fitness and the gym where he was tired I would actually push myself to go to the gym finishedabout come back home and then relax Aisa prioritise that physical exercise even if I was tired so when you push your will against what your body is requesting to you to do I will actually strengthens overlord character yeah it's exactly what you that I feel like you're just kind of stop your bodily just right pushing your will to a certain degree and all this translates to a stronger will power your career so you on those days wheremaybe you have to work on a Saturday on a Sunday may be used to work with a longer than the rest of your team may be used to push extra hard compared to what you already pushed in your career you are able to do that with is that all people don't understand pic pic your personal battles and very often when you train your body and your mind in all the internal functions that physical fitness something internal your muscles are inside your body or as Viraj Viraj journey is about female fitnesskind of his strength and his whole female fitness journey and it gives him a lot of willpower said that his one was relentless guys when it comes to work ethic is on the best work ethics officer in it that when Virat Yudh entered my life your life changedI feel you are you the right influence on my life in in many aspects in terms of like work at it did rub off on me like I started working little longer live it harder you got worse than you know I love basketball so there is this guy who won the MVP last is name is gyan Insan today compoone day it's a big part of the Ranveer show Bible jhagada basketball episode 1 the best episodes be done but was said when he won in MBP that every year I think that my career zone is good get easier but not trained to the extent very tall automatic and in every year is no wait after at this killer swell after that skill level and it keeps getting tougher to that founders leaders of groups youtubersneed to challenge themselves every oh and if you feel like you're done with this personal life challenges like how Virajpet challenges on private parts to your level up why not let let let let letmy life my best recommendation again for anything like this like meditation in a right lekin meditation you don't block you thought you let all your thoughts come to you and you defend them so that's what I did with these things right I I up I let these thoughts pass through and every time I knew him defend them you don't block these thoughts like you just let them through that ok cool if I am getting asexual urge of whatever I will I will hold that and I will not consider just try to like this track my survival hold that and I will breathe in breathe out I will accept it and I will who won I will not act upon it so that that what I did initially of during the times when it got too difficult what I just did this because whenever you're feeling a sexual urge there is a source in your testosterone right I don't know that scientifically correct but neithersuperdry dude I just instead pickup double or to just 15 pushups right there and that gives me a different sort of kick that say you're an orgasim would also provide some using that search in testis around to diverted to a useful action I don't the surgeon testosterone as much as its origin just your physical energy like other something actually that Vivek Bindra and me discussed on thatvisited every time you are feeling it is an excess amount of energy in your mind mental energy so ideally you should chalate Idea into something creative like yeah like writing for you know creating YouTube videos of whatever but also you should or you can but also you can find the channel is it into physical activity that how you kind of drain yourself in this habit in my lifewas I was reading this book atomic habits ok and the very interesting thing that the authors as their that you truly want to change habits of the book is basically all about creating a new habits in your life and how good habits can really transform your life in exponential manner and bad habits can really take you down the slippery slope he said that if you really want to change your habits and you develop good habits like reading or working out of things like that don'tcredit from an outcome perspective but look at it from an identity perspective what that means when you are looking at outcome tried to set out habits you are thinking about a I want to be the luckiest guy that I want to Europe win the Championship I want to lose weight I want to read like 500 books in the year for example but you are putting an outcome in a goal to that because of that the because the last task is so difficult your consistently towardshabit does not see you know you start out with all your energy that gyanguru read final books on the 1st of January you place that when you don't in the following that instead what you need to do is unit of making a part of your identity say that I am a rider I am a fit person see that I am an achiever and when that happens you will do action or you would take actions which stood your personality and aligned with your personalitywhere of if you are to people who were both smokers and a boat in the process of quitting smoking one of the guys you offer such that no thanks I am trying to quit and the other guy are you officers that no thanks I am not a smoker now that that's both are trying to quit but the second person has made that a part of his identity that I don't smoke at all that face of my life has is beyondis thinking that you are I am trying to quit when you put that thought in mind there is a chance that you will sleep sometime that you will actually you know take that one driver to drive thinking that you would find it just to track so that is very important aspect of this is guided ocelot through our start of life and she actually focuses on the habit of selecting your words very carefullymovies you describe yourself to be you introduce yourself that you choose to have in conversation that can really create a certain amount of self identity and that is something that's one habits I am trying to absorb into my right now where I am talking even more positively for example in the lockdown situation when we are addressing someone you know how to start off with I hope you are well I hope is kind of an Empty word and she taught me to start saying I trust you are wellyeah it's more of a metre and you actually know it sounds very stupid but when you start applying these concerns you really see your perception of the world becoming more positive so instead of an Hero I feel I am a very positive dude even saying I hope you are well is positive but is your take it to the highly positive degree that puts into perspective the people who constantly it's a negative thinking out loud about life is meaninglessyou know God I think we're so I don't know what's what we went through what's even though I am not sure why do we even exist and you can ask questions I will you feel that you know try having the launches eventually because it's like what the purpose of life is to keep yourself happy and to keep others happy I just think it's not complicate things at the end it is to spread smile to enjoy it while you're at it is actually feel life is awonderful gift man I don't right I don't want to be one of those toxic positivity guys that over such a happy day today and you know it I wonder who are stated that every secondthat's not going to be an issue but know that eventually each problem that you face with there will always be a solution or at least three miles down the line you will be in a position that you will laughing at that problem that way to write your thoughts on towards a new words and actions and we define that is what we call by manifestation that when you see that ok I am an achiever or I will win the trophy you are putting your thoughts out in the right direction so that your action can follow with thatit is man I want to bring the conversation back to nofap in a bit and just generally habits and how the kind of affected the outcome of situations but was I just wanna remind you of that one vacation that I think you me Rajas and Neel coronavirus had in Punjab like outside Chandigarh is a place called Moksha which honestly is a pretty expensivefancy Resort that we had visited and maybe we had actually haven't spent our own money it was a gift to give a gift from our sponsors who also kind of actors mentors in alive a particular group of guys who just like in a young Businessman this is our way of paying out for this slightly older than other duda remember that one week and we spent there we had a great male we went out to theof the hotel and the four of us were just staring at the city of Chandigarh we were looking at the sky full of stars we were sitting next to the heated swimming pool on those like swimming pool chairs and he was like wow do this is what we work for life like thank god we didn't go down that regular bath and body to cut the father of entrepreneurship and no matter how difficult and challenging it is for a moment like this it all was that I remember youshutting up their completely new and used if this is what we will receive from the word I am Rider work that hard all my dear comrade challenge myself all my life so that the outcome of the Habit chual life space where through my life have been from a middle class family right and I don't mean to go down that pretty Road initially we were quite well to do as a family and that theysome issues and we face as a family during the 2008 crisis and from there on so up it was very difficult as a family for us to you know even spend on for me to go to field trips and things like that and this level of your luxury that we saw in Parwanoo it was out spellbound Manav like thank god for this and we I know we worked really we would like to use of whatever and this is the level of luxury villa receiving I made a promise toyou know I will not let people down who are in my team of the clients that I have this because what the bigger the gift that we receive in mind that is crazy I was to grateful that day and I am hold that promise to the state myself and I will do so in the future as well but I will always ensure that the people around us are you know Belfort will treat the clients are well serviced and that's why only like that my return gift to the worldthat's why you're able to put pressure on yourself to change your personal life of so easy to maximize your potential I want to ask you do like most media entrepreneurs also Hui meet epadi into like pot really into like alcohol honestly I was well before you came into my life and then I think you come in my life and clean that up for me as well so how have you been able to stay away from party I know you party Din College I know you consumedused in college but now in your life dual Italy don't have a Nasha your life and I cannot hear a straight edge Galaxy M Punk am also kind of reach that stayed in my own life because your influence rubbing off on me so how what is going on in your head how are you enjoy your life yes I think againfriends who are into it or just into drinks and things like that and at media parties you just cannot miss it like that part of the tradition that no matter what the biggest platforms used in the some sort of like app called what is a mixture you know that how things work in the adult life and I realise that I made that part of Identity I don't need alcohol or Europe Eid or any of these intoxicants in my life because I don't necessarily enjoy themyou do they do it in your college life to experiment and I honestly feel that in life you should always experiment things once so that you know what is exactly that you want to do and what is exactly what you don't want to do when you that is not my calling at all and I come from a traditional Gujarati family as well and this has never been passed down into are you know family time I am glad that I am following that pass and you know I've come to realisethings some some to my own experiences some through the teaching that having passed on through my family and I'm glad that I don't need any of these intoxicants in life I don't judge or you know Splendor anyone who does experience that all who does go through it and if that works for them that alright but personally my KYC is always when that one invoice hit same event that one shot of Concept closes oven at oncebusiness women's open or when the higher like one more person and Europe he gets to feed your tickets to feed the family and again I don't mean to sound very well you can now but the kick that these things give you right and European given a specific award and I know that you shouldn't you be looking for external validation and things like that but think like this really of you know validate your choices you made to three years back you know when when I quit that job to join in on your own you likeyou are also like taking a shot in the open right School let's let's join hands and legs figure out how this can work out those are what are the memories that we collect in front of you and I am so glad we do this and that we are able to enjoy at 3 p.m. on Wednesday I am not doing some job that I don't like I am instead recording some content to be with you without actually reaching out to millions of peopleand I hope it doesn't good to use true that so that that's probably the life I wanted to live at the store is it LED me to a life that I have always wished for so that is the my yeah that's The Power Of Habits men and women both sides of that battle have been from a family that enjoys it partying so I have ever really party hard in my life like thrown up in find my parents multiple times because of drinking too muchhappened and I switched over to this side of the game which is a very Monk kind of life while it is slightly weird for them to accept what I will tell young people watching this worked right now listening to this watching design thinking that should I be telling myself I will you totally should be challenging yourself in terms of quitting certain habits that you know it Aliabad I'll tell you why it makes your mental willpower like really haialso extremely sharp and focused if you are a metadata in mixer meditations go live a deeper and through those deep meditations that's why you're actually gained the benefits are more easily so for example if you meditate for three years with all these habits in your life you will gain benefits of meditation but when you start looking at those bad habits from your life you see that each of the meditation is deeper and in be performed in addition isactually see of the real benefit you read of like a coma state of mind higher levels of mental focus less sleep quota will you be able to your Getaway with 5-6 hours of sleep it takes some time I get the select a few small habits that you are not adding up your long-term happiness and try cutting name of gradually which also brings me to the next aspect of this nofap themed conversation with the dude 200 days of nofap like what is it donepoem mind you explain the how you got to know that you challenge yourself in many situations you've failed but I'm still attempted the challenge again to now you're gone on for 200 days without letting go of your Viraj your so how has your semen contributed to your mind or your daily life as an entrepreneur things start with I just seem to have a lot more time in and you usually have you always have that answeryou want to work out why don't you start looking at phone I just don't have the time to do it is usually not the time it's also the energy due to water the boat your energy to a hard Court physical activity like that now that I am not Europe super Temple watchingporn all your Spending My Time with tissue papers and my phone and some lotion I know that I can use that time to just wake up and get go get a boost of get some I installed a pull up bar at outside myjump into the urine flow state of working out should become part of Identity that you usually we wake up and a lot of people they engage in this activity is there before going to sleep or right after your waking up or taking a shower and things like that so I have eliminated those possibilities at the root itself that if I am going to have a shower or whatever I will not take my phone with me for example it is the first step of youtrying to inculcate that activity right of the moment I wake up I will not check my phone I will just Euro drink a glass of water water bottles and get get working out for example an especially in the lockdown to have the time to do that you don't have to rush to work you can wake up a few useful at the liberty of waking up at the time you want to in some cases so why I just use that to my advantage and you are I keep going and going up with one thing thatwitnesses really gonna I also posted a photo on my Instagram which a reason and pointing out that is ok my my biceps what about seem like a little grown out becoming a teacher and a flexible but enough in it but more than that a lot of people are noticing that all my life I've been very skinny and suddenly when I put post the popular photo like that people start thinking wait what the hell happened why does it seem to be like a swordtransformation was your face looking a lot more to load up things like that but that's another thing right women really notice think like this you are the hole theory about how many practice nofap and things like that women are attracted to you all of that stuff right it's any it is which like in AXE effect of thing like this that is to be showing no papa zola is it snacks during the moment you start applying it to get attracted to let you know that would happen is women reallyillicit intuition of this sense of observation that have we can truly spot these things your dark circles release top Europe coming through this and going away because you seem less tired you doing more things that help in your body to your face this natural starts growing up a lot to do the things that they notice one of my friends are your one of these days when I was practicing this during the before all of them said to me that what happening do you use it seems less tired and youare you doing something in specific and I think like let it out of this out so that another thing thatyou have a few articles that writing a bunch of LinkedIn post we think like that and that has resulted in a one my following sort of growing on social media me having a distinct voice people resonating with things like that we building no contact so that we all know it's helping in my career growth and also with the company itself and more people are recognising what Monk entertainment us because we putting out content on the beachbefore I wasn't in the sort of right capabilities to do that I don't know what reason is exactly devoted to it but I believe that what are the reason is because I was just so tired like so exhausted all the time and I would recommend practicing no but for that very reason this go and I do I do want to quote about any of the scientific spiritual benefits toward this do it to see it for yourself that you will actually see experience this is one of those things like of Europe debate between vegetarianism or non vegwrite about your person police are you stick to that you can always convince people to do it to practice it yourself and see the changes for yourself and then you will realise this probably the way to go for me what do you think is next in terms of habit formation like what after nauvin keep going on nofap for life what you're thinkingViraj all over the wall you should join the is the most inspiring and funny community where is because usually order the story is this is one story ad of a guy who is like it was so movieI am doing this movement for my future wife so that I can laser I am not Europe on a date things like that so I can Europe put satisfied and you know things like that how to do because of that now right left are you think thatdo not write to you should follow that page edges of you know jacking off a word about that page only motivates you through means and personal stories of why you should not like masturbate so the goal is not to admin go on forever Si I did this experiment so I am not going to I don't know have planned for future what I do know as from my purseI have taken that beat out that ok I don't consciously think about phone I don't want you think about jacking off Euro in saying that this is a practice for people who are at a bit of an advanced stage in life if you are a very Primus page your thinking about sex like every second of your life and you know if you don't let your heart is out you make it some thought he was crime do not like practices I would knowit's ok let one out Thoda Karke Bahadur kodipetta ok and you are you staying at them and shit like that to that should definitely not be an outcome of this journey is not you should read on this path only if you want to feel a lot more groundyou know I feel more focused so that down my outcome of this if you are feeling like Roli wrestlers of all time it's ok just let out you don't have to be on this journey from the get go if you know if you are breast-feeding feet and the day move on to make new Ones I want to then you know once in 3 days taken as a gradual step which is also where I want to add somedon't from the Vivek Bindra podcast I asked about ok nofap is grade syllabus is great but what happens after marriage when you are suppose to have sex are you supposed to not ejaculate the and he said that as long as your ejaculation and the process of sex is fuelled by love it automatically kind of has its own spiritual impact on your existence that whole process so sex where it's just for the physical aspect for pleasure is xis negative but sex within the realms of marriage within the realms of infinite love that exist within marriage it actually makes you closer to your partner make both of you spiritually grow and also there is this concept in Yoga of I don't know what is called which basically divided life into four stages so your initial stages wale loading that before the age of 25 way of preparing for the world the state after that is where you or a familyhouseholder householder CEO in the house holder says the rules kind of change when it comes to see when it comes to spiritual growth to grow through providing for your family but if you are under the age of 25 no semen retention holding your Viraj in as much as you can all that isyou are in that pretty 25 year old face of a life holden Yuvaraj sonyou have you Baat to your family to friend for so there are certain duties that are required of you and any reproduction is I don't think is mandatory anymore but it is one of the things that people look at this building the role Legacy your you know having a family and do you know Cup fee for breathing in feeding the family is on the duties at people look forward to serving you ate them there are we have to give a few friends who do plan to0 bachelor life and not in a good sense light not go out this you like hunting and fit like that but living in a very light Sadhu lifestyle not getting married or staying focused 2 weeks ago that they might have you know doing better for the planet doing better for the communities around them and it's like you have to pick your battles me personally I definitely feel like I'm one of those who want to get married who wants to build a familyI don't think that to happen I can't read a my Viraj Viraj I will have to let it out nice we believe one of the people get pregnant just because God wants them to benice and the final question of this podcast is a dude like today now do you feel any kind of earth still like what happened that day 200 versus day 7 because I just want to put things into perspective for the audiencenot let the kind of distractions you have in life to get towards that over Europe any and all of social media is in today's time super like hypersexual we live in Subah and hyposexual X write the kind of content that there is out there there are so many like inclinations for people to this go out and joke of heroine just to satisfy them meet because we live in really fast times we live in times ofgratification to easily accessible man so up so once you're constantly you don't let that thought out of your mind that ok to go is always do you know just a joke of I have one day I will use it now stop thinking of it as a part of you you will not hear those what is very internet you will end up hurting you will suppress them you will just not feel them you will automatically be second nature poemthat was to something else to start writing creative you will then you will automatically pickup the pen of pick up your laptop and start writing if you are a writer or if you are in a content space for pickup the temple move move your energies to something that is more productive to you as well as other person so that is not happening at 800 you don't consciously think ki School update will have to let one out of the bathroomthat is the major difference it it makes you wake up even up I will only speak for myself here but alot of my wouldn't it possible lot of my Europe was that I was facing unable to take on the world over head on Hero cause a because I just Europe had that will power build that will power within myself lyricsto control my most Primal Earth and your diverted to more productive things I can take on anything in this world more than that that's very indirect effect that you face as a person to for that again I would recommend this is this be the reason why I would recommend beyond what spiritually and scientifically the talked about and just to clarify your not in that position when a girl touches you you like let out all your where are the right to livenot in that mental right nowof the process and I just don't feel less go to be like a storm of love dried at the objects in fat word comes to of the interacting with women as well as I had a lot of people say that it makes them more confident when they speaking to be made via tell you is because the kind of society we grow up a number of times you've grown up in it's a It's a way in which like women have always been sexual ise okaap you know win even when you are growing up the rate of content that you know were fed the kind of times we live in with the surroundings will never think like that it's always that you used to treat the other sex the opposite sex as you like and I want to meet with each one of them for why I have to look at them sexually you start looking at them as a human more where you will not sexual eyes everything you see in the opposite wordyou will your brain was Tatya Tope me have a conversation speak and rabbit connect to that person for centre of Thinking properties than that that would stop happening and honestly I'm not saying that you know you will completely become a sexual organ of that or you will not want to engage in sexual Koi this would happen if you will connect tomorrow on a deeper and human level with the opposite person and I think is the namefirst man we need to be kind of we need to be more non-sexual in this hyper sexual environment when interacting with people that have noticed when I'm with Sarvesh Shashi OU Om myself also when I'm on my long nofap streaks which is that that exactly what you said that what happens and ladies as well as justaround you picks up on that this person has a different Vibe about the outside would receive initiate have the State Bank you for being on the Ranveer show that call him ok keep fighting your internal battlecounter in built on the forum so what happens is the moment they have a username system on Reddit right so if you are on the nofap community next to your username

21,5 BIG Love Lessons From My Past 5 Relationships | The Ranveer Show 43,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV9APlaH78g&list=PLfNW_1ECVaThQynVe4QDlBM5S6Kzy8CeJ&index=22,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CV9APlaH78g/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCdc_yAB9_leo04G_o8OBOFamx30Q,talk about on the Ranveer show to the listeners of this podcast living in some great times it's difficult time so the world and that I thought let's kind of product positivity in the world through this podcast keep in mind that is what causes all about stories I am going out of my own personal life without taking any names that ok but everything a loan from all my break ups all the relationships that had in the past given my name friends with all of them everyone updatehave you are a wonderful love and still close to those people have taken the permission to create this episode so let's begin at the age of 14 the about 7 girls in my class and there is one person who I really enjoyed with all of you is my best friend in school and what do you know you end up liking that person but you think your definition of love as a kid is movies is Anjali and RahulKuch Hota Hai things like that so you think that person who you feel for completely at that point is gonna be your ultimate person without understanding what you really need in life what you really need for relationship without even completely understand yourself you give all of yourself to that other person and that pretty much what we did intense relationship we were seen the music video Love The Way You Lie with Eminem and Rihanna was kind of like that very intense fiery relationship it was a relationship from mychildhood and a look back at it be fondly I feel like Rosary in a sample of the first time you ever feel something for anyone else very very beautiful When It Ends it feels as intense it feels like a whole world is come tumbling down the lesson again from that one was that never letting go something good for something that could potentially be great as you grow up in life as you age you end up discusslot of things about yourself you also possibly ground to different people value in a relationship that person might grow into something else you might grow into something else and eventually you my device in your head that tells you that might be someone else out there for me who I am more suited to and this is where a second person came into my life plus call her Disha again we were too young back then I think you are bored 19 or 20 years old and honestly this was also the middlestudying I was in the middle of my starting process I feel like both was made mistakes in that phase with a heavily for those mistakes honestly this is also the face that began Engineering College where I got into alcohol DPS spoken about it on the channel in the past three dealt with a deep form of depression back pain because of the Cocktail of things happening around me and relationship happened at the wrong time infected push me deeper into that dark pet that created for myself thata lot of teenagers especially in the late teens or early twenties deal with this kind of situation and the reason is a teenagers in the early twenties because I feel you really mature at 22 but before the age of 22 you still have an element of that appeal love left inside you at the only way I know how to love is with all 100% of my intensity that the second lesson do not get emotionally dependent on other people do not make them the centre of your worldrelationship should be a part of your life not your entire life your entire mood all your emotions the way you perceive the world the we perceive your day should MI centre on one person because if at all it comes down crashing is good attitude really really hard to put you down any deeper pit that you already sliding down was already in a very weak mental stated that point taught me a lot about life for shock when you be turned down by lifebiggest teacher in life that's also why we created the mental fitness series on beerbiceps eventually mental fitness is the ability to back allowed difficult situations in the world in what covid-19 is a very good example of a difficult situation for the world by peoples mental fitness levels are coming to the forefront you again this is the most real version of people what's the underlying emotion behind everything they do is it positivity is it ambition is it hopeis it cynicism is it anger what happening all that coming out but I feel if your mentally fit you'll always perceive a situation like covid-19 positively or at least practically that's why your work on your mental fitness and sometimes your relationships are your greatest teachers when it comes to mental fitness to toughening you up their greatest lessons in life whether you're alone positive things from them or negative things from them they will make youvault being and this is where the third relationship of my life begin at about 21 I began of very beautiful relationship with a very beautiful person does call on Natasha and this person had the purest heart everything I felt I had felt for my previous to relationships I felt this person was the first person who reciprocated those feeling this person was the first person who could love back with the same intensityovertime once again that same problem of growing up you grow into two different individuals with different priorities but is the one relationship I look back at and say that you know what that's the relationship that kept me Sane it probably got me or that deep pit of Darkness another beautiful aspect of relationships definitely help you grow but more importantly at certain stages of your life they pull you out of the pit that you wish to be pulled out of the almost rescue you now is not healthy but that's just the nature of being human beingsometimes you want someone to get the lifeboat and come get you if you're not mentally fit if you don't have perspective of this world if you are not a mature person exactly like a 21 year old Ranveer allahbadia sometimes you take people for granted sometimes you project all the pain that you've been through on to them that use lesson I learnt from that particular one don't project your pain don't project in securities on someone elseTamil love you with an open heart problem projected more negativity on this person than my previous two relationship people because I felt like you know what no matter what happens this person won't leave me that's why you can see that my ugly decide which is not correct and that something you'll learn as you grow up you cannot project your shortcoming on the someone as for those of you don't understand projection me the given example if you see your parents having a bad relationship your parents ruleset youwatching them looking at the behavioral patterns to say if you grow up and service to Lord was a lot was growing up in broken families in India especially we grew up with parents having tips with family members having tips with each other we think it's ok and that part of all relationships are you grown up holding onto that little negative idea which eventually you throughout the person your dating you through the person who loves you be start taking that person for grantednever do that are you want understand the depth of this situation until it happens due until someone does the same to you if you ever had a relationship that even when marginally toxic the toxicity the poison of the relationship comes from the other person's past their experience is growing up there are bringing their insecurities are projected onto you so next time if you're dating someone also currently dating someone and you want to say something nasty to them you want to lash out at themyou want to take out your frustration and throat on them 1 minut take a step back and understand the consequences of your anger understand the consequences of your toxicity that were understood from that relationship this person had the most beautiful heart in the world and I honestly feel at home every relationship you take away a positive from that person your dating from that person at took away the possibility of thethat nice and life how can someone be so nice we definitely grow into different people we parted ways and eventually the next person came into my life at this stage of my life was in my early twenties and early twenties especially in a country like as which is this Kari or driven the all about growth in this world sometimes even your partner's you have a quest for growth through them you tell yourself that you know what am I go again this relationshipGrand the relationship of butterflies in your stomach because of someone then he even better does that little base layer of ambition and growth and positivity and on top of that the cherry on the cake is used butterflies in your stomach if you like your school kid even after college is done out in the real world sometimes you hold onto innocent love that way but you need to understand that thing I keep sayingpeople growing into different individuals that no jump like the jump that you experience from the age of 20 to 25 you be an extremely different person 822 compared to the person you are at 25 because the real world starts hurting you you get access to older people who aren't just for teachers you get access to people who have Mentos you get access to new experiences your earning money for the first time and adult for the first time it so wave of newnessonly grow into different people not also understand that your early twenties special in India is a tester period for your married life people especially society appearance is generation expects us to get married in a late twenties possibly early thirties to any relationship you have early twenties is a test drive for that your changing so much from the age of 20 to 25 the changing spiritually your changing financially to understanding your owncapabilities in this world and therefore your ambitions are changing rapidly just imagine the depth of change that taking place in your own mind may be the reason that person loved you in the first place not exist within you anymore at how much you changed and the big lesson I learnt from this one is that no matter how perfect relationship seems today always take it a little slowly and communicate a lot underperspective especially in your twenties understand the stage of life that there at and if you feel that you are taking away from that person happens in any aspect that slow down a bit don't get ahead of yourself life is extremely long and the best relationships are sometimes the ones that progress really slowly until your married to someone you can't give 100% of yourself to that person please understand that and that's another mistake that sometimeBollywood mix 2 Crazy intense love with you gone to school you made those mistakes but you repeat those mistakes in your mid twenties because they earn money for an adult you have your own personality maybe this time you are so sure of your have the same I was so show your career your sure that this was available and it may not because destiny me not be in your hands destiny not be in your favour maybe you aren't meant to be together you need toprocess that fact that until you actually married to someone help and you married to someone for at least five years I feel you should go Story 1 One Day At A Time especially in a mid twenties way growing so fast that reason the so many devices in the modern day Lord people Russian marriage a lot of people ration marriage for the wrong reasons dating someonegoing out then hang out of them is very different from living with them you'll understand what it's like to live with the person you travel with them or when you will live in relationship and good luck trying to create a live-in relationship in India not the easiest place have one that the true test for marriage you need to experience what is like being that same person for more than just a week and understand that persons like to breed with unit of comfortable silence is you need to bethe person all the time or your activities your conversations your ambitions your goals need to match it slow with the learning process find the only goal with the almost 27 year old version of Ranbir at this stage of my life is my five rules for successful relationships Rule 1 as much as bad breakups have taught me against proclaiming this rule I still believe in true love endDil believe that butterflies in your stomach are a necessity unit have that days level of attraction you need to be the physically attracted to a person Unity intellectually attractive person and prosperity Reward Plus you need to be spiritually attracted to the person that days of attraction has to be there when you meet the person the first time you have to get some butterflies in your stomach going you know what even 3-4 years into a good relationship sometimes you need the butterflies in your stomach and keep in mind this does happen to human beings maybe it's thatvoice maybe that persons Ada in Hindi The Woodcutter Ada with basically translates to will started movements in the things they do the way they put the head back to the flies and mosquitoes with angry these little things will break up with someone those are the things we miss all the things I've got you charmed in the first place that person spoke with a person smile not just looks much just brings it all UP package deal that kind of two ends of the butterflies in your stomach second aspect of thisfriendship friendship is way more important than relationships romance and love you begin very intense love you begin romantic is a chance that all that file might burn out at some point but if your relationship is built on the basis of friendship at the to test the relationship of great life hack is to be able to see how well you gel with that person's friends if you get along with the friends you'll probably andlong term relationship that person BKC when you are attracted to someone it's a combination of lust love and friendship eventually lost fades sometimes even love fades but you're left with the friendships and relationships turn into a partnerships according to me that's why you need to be able to have that partnership that person Under test for partnership is that if you remove the element of attractionwho is this person that you love you be able to know who that person is by knowing my friends because people Vibe with others like themselves if you like the friends company is very likely that your in a good long term relationship right now if you don't take a step back and get the situation season the golden rule is applied everyone but most cases you need a CPU in gel with reference point don't go outperfection in relationship don't go looking for the 100% perfect partner notebook on a perfect cube from another be perfect and the most will get an array antenna and nylon 10% look gorgeous but might have some major flaws se in conversation this person might be extremely intelligent but may not be able to dress well and that might be an important factor view this person may be smart and loving towards you but doesn'tI want to talk to your family you ask yourself that those two points are missing in this person can eat on 10 those two points that I am missing a day that crucial for you ok new bridge that gap through good communication this is my friendship comes another factor 1 second talk a lot to each other relationships are about accepting people who they are but it's also about bridging gaps through a bit of compromise Bira compromise because you are not returnno problem it on 10 number 4 if you are in a serious relationship or you want to develop a serious relationship with someone exchange ideas about your long term goals where do you see yourself and your 50 years old not professionally where do you see yourself as a big house in your up in some Orchard is it a small flat in Mumbai aur Delhi where you just want your coziness we just won't give your dog may be a kid is it summary of beachGoa that person this question is why do they see themselves if you really love them ask yourself if you can put yourself within their dreams discuss your long-term visions because that need to match and win that does at what rate magic in the most symbiotic relationships and did show Bill Gates and Melinda Gates spoke about this at some point exchange ideas and that Shobana covid-19 Michelle Obama exchange ideas about the long-term vision divisionsambitions after match what you want from life in terms of kids pets the way you want you like to be your daily cycles what time you wake up things that living like that matter in the long term and the fifth and final rule have a life outside of them have repeated this point through the course of this podcast but at the one take learning of my life till this point it cannot be thebuild your own family your own parents your pets eventually your children are part of your world none of these aspects the entire world a new relationship also fits into a world in the same way the best relationship help you grow bring out the best in youth EP help you learn a lot about life support you in your dark times but they still just a part of your life remember that love is the biggest motorin the world was recently listened to podcast by Tim ferriss he was interviewing the former surgeon general of USA who is dealt with a lot of patients who were on the death of his one learning of life was that when people are dying don't talk about the career the don't talk about the Instagram following they don't even talk about the amount of money in the bank the talk about the relationship that were the highlights of the life of the people whobook a feeling of love inside them at what you remember when you're dying love is the biggest motivation behind everything we do we want to become rich to give to the ones around us not just to feel a sense of power ourselves it's not human nature is built human it was all about socializing giving the others and that's why I strongly believe that relationships are definitely just the part of your life but don't stop believing in love at the same time when you loving loveopen heart but love with all these learnings as a part of your subconscious mind I hope you enjoy this podcast was like an intense Hata Do Loreal request for this episode we run we should interview Ranbir and think this is the

a journey from Gangotri from the start of Ganga write up to Calcutta in a speedboat in a large pin code so when you reach Banaras they told me the story I didn't witnessed this was one of these queries Who said this is nothing in these boats have no power to decide what do you mean should I cant stop it with my erection ok so it's not that on the bankboat was in the water in the tie a rope to the boat and it added to his erection imagine that is holding the direction for that long started the mood and he held for at least 3-4 minutes and it will be slightly darkBernard very wise episode of the Ranveer show with the personal unit of my life in many ways nice meeting you are always about talking about career change things up and just a sceptic switches for class of Goa today episodelisten to The Other episodes of this time we're talking about the most well read humans have come across in my life The Legend of the world of branding and Advertising in India but we will be talking about the darker experiences of your life will be talking about the darker books that you've read you also spent a lot of time in Banaras with young yes so I am dead sure you are some crazy stories from back then as wellso in this podcast with an aim to stimulate The auditor's Mind going on the Ranveer show Wesley thank you getting here again my first question is about a Gora like how people call it a Go release the ovary culture so for a complete Rookie for complete Noob could you what are the right one of the things we should begin by saying to askif you are born in India if you have an enormous opportunity because as a Civilization very old as a nation we are very I'm right but as a Civilization we are very old and therefore you have millions of ways of experiencing reality is beyond the normal millions of in the normal way we know is yoga and yoga this is that it is stronger which means it has itYam Niyam Sadhna Samadhi all of 2020 of yoga not only do I have to do to have to practice the yogasan which is the physical part of it you are to practice control and all of the whole life style has to be about it but it isn't a stronger part which means it has 88 things that must be in place so that is called the right hand of God the left hand of God is called a Gora Gorais like the short sharp quick way and you guys this long when did we would you guys safer this if it goes wrong if a Gora goes wrong you could and I'm dead or you could end up as a mad person and I read a lot about a Gora from in English there will be millions of books in Hindi and Sanskrit and all of that which I havebut the books that have made accessible in English is a gentleman can't Robert svoboda so his ratnakara 123 which has mind blowing stories so he came to India and study in Ayurveda and from there he got attracted or always perhaps she always attracted in 2 hour and found a group on Vimal Anand and then you have only stories about time traveltravelling into other people's bodies and all of the mystical powers that agrees can have some rewinder LLB 2 side right hand of God left hand of God and is a parts at the end of the path and both get you do that same and that this is just two parts that could be many more for instance there is a there is a path pant or a sectNath Panth and the Guru at the top of it is that and you have machindranath Gorakhnath all of that diesel practitioners of Kundalini yoga ok so Kundalini yoga the belief is that there is a Serpent called price at the base of your spine make a pool of energy it's so it's the female energy then when you practice youshe Rises through the 6 chakras that you have and when it merges with the top Chakra which were the male and female meet then you have enlightenment deliberation got so anyone who's got an item and exactly reason that Kundalini inside that is if you're in you believe in that notion of that path ok so I lived with a customer care of A Walk to Rememberhe won't mention any of this was his entire thing was if you are aware if you are fully aware you are mad in India where you will be free of the entire habit of thinking and conditioning and all of that should it which is wanting the most interesting part of our civilization is that you could be encountering hundreds of parts god all tried tested workedexperimented with parts to Liberation fast Liberation what happens at Liberation at Liberation one idea of Liberation is to do with rebirth that you are no longer Reborn this eternal cycle of being Reborn its retracted and suffering and suffering the other idea is off if you do not believe in live birth or anything like that that you are free of everythat causes suffering to mankind you are free of anger your free of fear you are free of any negative emotions and you become what is called as a stithpragya the person who has total economy it means he whose mind is completely study irrespective what happened outside andyou also get what they call Siddhi is a superpower is meant to be it's this you can become very heavy very light therefore can walk you can fly with its famous in this so I think Hanuman had the it's so basically there is no real translation for the day in English by means that when you on the path of yoga very evolution is a right end of life kind of powers that you canget if you are very serious about your your park is a very if you really look at the person who is realised all of them are Gonda se don't pursue that because that will actually shorten your path because you will get ill get hypnotized by having the city and the drink in that power and therefore your lost the rest of the path got so again if youto learn how to actually beginner meditation session again to listen to this podcast with David after is not an instruction for V about those topics with doctor Radhakrishnan play this is about the stories that you had come back to talking about ahora so so my knowledge about these is that accident on ripley's believe it or not on X and where they basically consume half burnt human flesh so you find the whole community ofplease in Banaras and one of the rituals when to eat human meat so do I familiar with this whole thing is just one direction is there are many OK so the what is the idea that there is you will go beyond your notion of what is good or what is bad by doing things which are completely outside human society you are also meant to have sex with youngdied and was buried like necrophilia necrophilia nodes necrophilia yes these are things men to push beyond the idea of good bad ugly not ugly this is right this is wrong that's the whole which is why it's called the short path which is just throws you into the deep end of these experiences and then you come out the other sidecompletely rid of all these normal notions of good bad ugly beautiful all of that what is your opinion on the concept of Ghosts of everything that you read there is a simple classification in our philosophy there is a classification Devgn manushya Gan and Rakshas Gan ok so if you belong to Rakshas Gan you areyou have a greater tendency to experience the operate on earth so gun is like a personality trait and a genetic disposition genetic disposition of the person who is born with the Devgn is unlikely to ever encounter any aukat experiences ok and the person with manushya Gan is likely to have both little bit of beautiful but coming back to ghostwhat is your favourite things I think because I am in Banaras Banaras is the in it is the scent of all these things to say to the centre Wakad there is also lets see some amount of IT in Bengal some amount of IT in Assam but the pyramid the epicenter is in Banaras is a Gora also the same thing as kala jadu youmistake in father ok because kala jadu would be practiced by somebody who has got those powers through some method but a Gaura in its purest form is not about doing tricks for how many human beings is not about how many human beings are only money by doing medical what is actually a genuine parts to enlightenment to our glorious have no intention of light onto your dreams aremaking many Hindu but what about this is movie koutuk by Ram Gopal Varma on black magic and you haveif you have learnt to control the tools can you become a tantrik so in Banaras for instance I was there in 79 think 7778 Hillary climb Mount Everest he undertook a journey from the Gangotri from the start of Ganga write up to Calcutta in a speedlarge pincode reach Banaras told me the story I didn't witness it was one of these Aghori is Who said this is nothing in these boats have no power to decide what do you mean should I can stop it with my erection ok short sat on the bank and the boat was in the water in the tie a rope to the boat and that I added to his erection imagine that is holding the direction for that longHindi started the moon and he held for at least 3-4 minutes and negative but there are people who are very advanced the yogic paath who genuinely deserve the respect to don't do the shade is it that the general you expect from governmentaudio have any stories about beautiful question I have had the privilege of meeting adjustment call Gudur marriage ok my father tried to get Deeksha long distance Greece Gurus give you Grace by giving Grace meaning they facilitate your journey on that part 3 help you advance yes or no particularaunty images Guru Purnima didi my father sad feeling a particular direction having Bade having something and he was to get Grace from coronavirus the amazing thing was nothing happened to him but my sister was just eight or nine she went into totally different zone she started doing yoga asanas she had never done your voice change in all of them like voice became heavyto my mum and me does a bit scary but then we came to understand what the whole thing was and we went and took her to him in Pune explain that obviously she is born with this Kundalini excitation sold but she'll have to decide what to do with it because it is a dangerous path ok but it's also possible that it was ready to some extent but in some extent it was Natural stone she had toconsciously Katil it then she met a Guru several years later and therefore our path was simpler thank you very much thank you for having me again I just give some quick book recommendations for people who want to get deeper into the aukat old and the others who want to get deeper maybe into the right handed clean your so soagravan Agra to ratri my current favourite on the right hand side in mindfulness is a book called mindfulness in Plain English by Bunty gunaratne truly beautiful that every page has a quotable court and the simplest non technical jargon language about what is this whole notion of a persongifted to god knows how many youngsters beautiful and thank you for being on the and lifetime probably the next I will do a conversation on business and branding this is a 360 degree

the listenersI also want to talk about the whole spiritual aspect of what you do you really respected media on the 9 today and I know you kind of your core is spiritual and your kind of growing your business is out of that spiritual place Pro cut to my 10th standard on 9th standard I remember reading your name at a newspaper or Facebook and that young Soundararajan Karya starts foxymoron you have a company called foxymoron which are not part of right nowI want to talk what is sorry bro you begin at Jai Hind College and how did you start foxymoron wanted foxymoron do what was the thought process that I was one of India's first social media based companies so that was a bit of by chance if I am a you know she will go back LLB Tu to school and 11th standard and I came back came out of the 10th standard and here I am in the 11th standard so this great School that thewhat is built up what was so amazing about it was the first time I felt pushing myself to think it forced me to think it was me to read it was in one summer that the giver Singh before you come to school every 12 books you know if it starts the process of of of questioning and what happened really is that you take that through college and I was taking the Truecaller so happened with colleges that I didn't I didn't choose to go like some ofpure Sweden choose to go outside India to study visa do you know there's a huge some views lessons to learn here solar Swades through the years from 12 and 12 was doing some sort of an internship in advertisingwhich is the giant in our business right now to go in there is to watch observe how this structure the workplace and I love this business I saw this interesting movie caller tune copy Ansar want to be in this business second year I was in a company so I stopped going to the advertising company for one year second year you are in the business of Hero we were trying to do this Wimax boxes or lower Bombay sweet setting up Wimax boxes or lower Bombay sahi se like advertising or do something with text and Advertising andaudio setup you know this great guy Rajiv Dhingra he was he runs a company called wat consult right now used to run a block call what block that I am web advertising Technology so in that was the birth of the Tech Ranjan mashable movement and Roses this was a 2007 and we were going to conferences like protal.in underground where you are interviewing Myntra just sort of Kamala you know Somani Flipkart just come alive when you're interviewing the founders I was basically a podcaster thengetting podcasts in writing blogs for one year there so those were really interesting times and I said you know the three years of this so then I said you know I will study the advertising do this internships and a God of college and all of these experiences in college I am like you know now I gotta put this altogether and very honestly the thing is that starting salary at the time was some fifteen sixteen thousand bucks it was my opportunity cost do I know if even if I take the risk and even for try to do something on my ownyou know I'm not going to be losing too much fortunately I was not in a position where losing that 56001 should mean the world to me I said ok let me give the risk and that's when you know we got together for office friends to set up this company foxymoron what was the invention that you always do social media marketing for brands so when I joined as I was the last guy to join in and also they were doing some experiments with doing some branding work for people T shirt printing business and thenI was watching the staff at what blog and I said to them that you bring me in I will bring in the social media marketing element element with that approach and then we then she decided to stay and said let's make social media mainstay and that time the big lessons at the time you know we were trying to build business for over a century trying to be what we didn't know at the time he was an sheet and better services business right and what we needed to do was you knowforum market which was unknown people didn't know social media marketing for still remember that we used to go in and take the train from VT and go on the Central Line or take the train from Churchgate and go in the western line train to meet company of a company and used to do this hundred slide presentation on what is social media marketing services just try to educate companies on that and then you are small companies to medium sized companies to then we got our first big break Cadbury somebody decided and said that come and meet I don't mindso we did 400 side presentation with him he said OK looks like this guy has some you know he's worth working with knows what he's talking about you know sorry maybe it was working with so we got the contract samet Instagram cadburys and first other contract was with cosmetics company Maybelline New York and they were both working with large Legacy agencies in Maybelline New York the time working with lodestar Universal part of the ipg groupAmerican company and will be was working with Cadbury so good chances to make you know those little chance that you are make the most out so on Maybelline we did a great job at 66 of what they previously he was giving that were in terms of absolute output if you look at the impact on the money spent and the output on and the impact on sales of 6a what they were getting all us this way to find a good now send you an annual contract and same thing happen with cadburysthese two groups then your automated is automatic because the other guys are talking to sing that ok now you are good let me talk to you about my brand dasvin cadburys after a purse brand was Bournville chocolate dark chocolate and then they came in and he said it had talked about Bournvita this is a nice nice I'm working on that staff and then of course with Loreal we got a lot of work with Anne boleyn is owned by the L'Oreal group so that we got L'Oreal Paris and because I got all they've got about 30 brands at 30birthday with a lot of France was this also like partly first mover advantage and sure you have felt like this no question about that but I remember you guys do that no one else that I remember like a guy you know some of those guys still now so Rajiv who are used to work with what blog Rajiv brand and what concert at the time ok Rajiv had a very successful exit with what concert Seoul to density and is very rich man now and now moving on to his nextthere is the guys from medium and social wavelength to fantastic sentiment Mehta Sanjay Mathur and Harish tibrewala in the second innings of entrepreneurship so you really get to see that they were like what I called at that time the Grand old man of social media over there and then there was Roopak Saluja with his Jack in the Box Independence and you know we work our industry such that we have a lot of established players also he was doing social mediayou know yes it was a beautiful snow advantage but I would say a lot of it was luck first and then there was also a lot of perseverance in instead of putting them together I think we are a great culture in terms of the kind of talent that we accumulated also coming back to this concept of multiple Agencies being that one thing people don't care about Bombay and just the general business world in India that this room for a lot of different companies to grow in the same absolutely need an exact sameand you'll also be having that is used Innova used money earned that is something that you know very interesting is when we crafted the articulation of shebang in a way that we wanted shebang and other sorry bol do with your service schedule bit about that it should Bank when we had we said that you know what we're seeing is while companies want to work with lots of companies they also in some cases want to work with one person who stitches it all together services will be the whole showright we bring the whole shebang and shebang in a sense it means completeness you know so that's that so this idea of completeness is what we are trying to bring and also very interesting interesting is that you know there is Logon se Asha #fusion with an exclamation which is in UNIX language it's when you have a hashtag fuse with an acceleration is actually called as she Bank it spend as a s h e a n g but we keep silence as SCH bng because another she Bank this soundsit again coincidence that also means read what follows innocent it so that was like this take heart that we want along with this idea of completeness but I realise that as we went along you know this whole we will bring the whole shebang to your point that this space for everybody what we realise is that look you know we may not be everything for everybody but we will help our customers on the company that we serve become more complete so then we say you are withimplement the company where it needs so this IDFC Bank from being the whole shebang to helping companies deliver completeness is Vienna in the journey of evolving to tailor-made solutions for both across the spectrum so you know we're at for some companies were doing process reengineering we will listening to the Employees and try to understand you know where the process gaps and bidding process reengineering were doing television commercial were doing corporate AV with just made a 45-minute feature film all so sowhere are you see the area for completeness to coming because that's that we had then bring him but want to go back to foxymoron you exit the company after years of being finished Its and half a personal level what happened like why did you feel that way I need to stop need to start somewhere else so for me what happen I didn't expect about this fall out over the last few years you know something first thing I didn't have a very clearis it you I am not so close with my friends who has to run it with then so I think that I would say first isliye messed up ok I am no I don't have regrets about what I did what I do I did look back and I said I have some regrets about how I didn't give you are running the company together essentially from my standpoint the way I saw it was that we want seeing the future together in the same way as a different versiondefinition that's that you know through our conversations that what that's what came out to me very clearly and so I said you know and I need to move on I was feeling a little kind of God so impressed choked so I said that's you know I need to get out of this would also happened is that the time we were you know it's written about in the press very very good acquisition of a by one of the Giants of an industry that acquisition of alsoUniversity for a timeline which was fairly long so I said that he know I am not seeing the Future the same way with these guys over the told you that ok bill by the company would use to serve in the company for us and USA pocketed like a huge amount of money at the end of those you through every junction ok to get money on they were not assigning a night like you know we have on your to your Oppo a5s 1/2 waiter salary or something so you are your call inindustry recorded on out more service sector Industries if you manage to sell your company then you are the guy who is buying your company will essentially want to lock UN within and outside got really want is that you know the service company once because of you and culture same like you guys have with monkey and then you know you are you got this one kind of your specialist at this one thing what is the people who make the service in the service business when they aredevil want you to stay at least for a certain period of time in the great companies which require other companies which are able to retain talent even after the acquisition period is over but they wanted us to do that now my thought process at the time was that I am not necessarily aligned with the four of us are not aligned I don't CSS focus aligned I am not seeing a value system the same so let me get out of the day we got the offer the next day as I was very clear the next day I resign after BComyou know what you call the the the the the first offer so so I said I am not you're not going to be a part of this became a little you know I die I think what I could have done better is that may be done a transition of 6-8 months was also running a lot of the operations so I said that you know I am I want to switch on as easily as possible and as quickly as possible so I think that's where I you know it got a little Messy I think of course from the standpoint they alsoin a similar line of business now in the early days hidden compete for the same customers but now we would compete for the same customers we have the same line of business although I am happy that you know we are from by all you are outside measure I think I should be getting better now and still on my in a 25% in foxymoron but but you know that that that is what I did I wish I could have done better and so from my point of view the answer is simply alignment with thoughtfulan alignment on values is what blood me to in every think continuing to work at mindset of yours when you adjust Centre your resignation you are sitting at home you don't know what to do next alike were done partly I want to build something big partly was happening so I was married at that time I was was got married I was but gone so I'll tell you enough to be honest I just be fully on its ok so I'll tell you whynot I was not in my right senses also I think I think where are you know we are we are just for should have you done reasonably well now we got here by by a third party with God in ranked as one of the fastest growing companies for the last three years so am I not to like not is not a big deal is a long way to go but you are some where you come you done something right but at the time I think I was so I left I was also I havebad habit that I'm in a habit of smoking hash V valve in the pretty bad habits at the time I was just putting out there was only for the past also add bad habit of vegetables like marijuana least it was so I think that a bunch of entrepreneur then it's not just you and me now I am out of it completely and juvia spoken about this and as one of the things we connect it was ok but at the time I rememberI think god damn lucky because I was out I was having a good night fat salary I was you know somebody is willing to buy a company I decided to get out I think somewhere the fact that I am saying that I messed up the exit is also that I didn't really think it through it wasn't necessarily thinking it through folding I was tired of seeing the consequences the ramifications I was in your Singh protecting myself also falifrom that time point where I was there is an another sim yes I was seeing a very I was very excited about what we could build for the so I think that you are one of the reasons that I can say what worked out is was there was a very clear vision on what we want to achieve as bag and you know what gaps we could fail and what kind of people we want to hear what kind of culture we want to set so you have to have some kind of a setup to show the largest customers in the countrythat look you know you can trust me with your mind it because I mean essential to clients worldwide to large companies hiring Agencies because they think they can do a particular job better and why do Agencies survivors succeed or exist in the in the world of business is because if they can actually do it better and and if if my clients business wins then I will just make sure that you know one of those catalyst to make sure that their company grows and as they go to keep doingPuja for hire that you are a very well put it is very well put out what the agency is due to the point when we put in a floor plan of 10000 square feet first office with 40 people hide on day one with not a single customer to back me so I put in my Savings and put that into putting this business together so I was the first six months shitting bricks because you can putbusiness plan you can write that you know in the first year you will have a working capital loss of one crore rupees you can put that on paper but when it actually happens when is your own money and bleeding out then you then You Ain't nobody can explain that feeling to you because then things start going crazy so I then in my first your and half I was We Were We Were bleeding money as per the business plan for gaining customers also your stamina are gap was falling but you are wewe want initial outlay because we want the customers to trust us and we want the biggest customers to trust us directly to customers trust at the first time you no one was Finolex Industries and was Godrej consumer products is a conservative Sindhi company Godrej the conservative party companies that is great because you know when you have to joint companies which are conservative backing a new house in IT sends a good great signal to the market the old Legacy Gai se ok this guy is OK to work soOBC of living money so that was really difficult difficult in the sense that to be honest I also went and found by 2 by my business and I said that you know you can take me 51% of a give me all my recovery of my original money back he said ok but been a negotiated that contract with him for one and a half years and I put a law firm for 300000 rupees on a law firm while negotiating that contract this guy who wanted to buy me was another again one of the legends in our industrybest 300000 rupees and spent my life because we were given a half years I really got inside the mind of a legend things like because the way he was negotiating the contract to understand what is going on in his mind and you know that that's very sad alone because let me Loan by observing what my opposite party is nothing that most of us know how we learn and as he walked closer and closer quarters with people you get to understand them better and then use this thing back and reflexive ke 5 ways to do this your how I do it for me approachthe first one and half is very scary very difficult mentally you are owning up in approximately you may be yawning 526 like a month to the new process for salary of 20000 does a lot of things to you what does it forces you to get discipline it forces you to University of rethink what are the important things you should be putting priority on you become more disciplined Mor Monk like in a way so that when allHero automatically all of the highest smoking in all of that went to be start going inside because you start becoming how do you bro at the time so this was between 27 and 32 16 phase and 32 now that's crazy so it I think problem that difficult ways can a purified you for the next phase of the life too much needed ya Mushaira right now in your life when you are 32 at the age of 50 are you going for that Billi natakmoney and not for the sake of money but for the sake of say something like Legacy or impact of power sharing that will in a tag someone not the tag but I would like to have enough money to be able to influence a lot of things that I think should be right with the world and I think that's the motivation that drives a lot of entrepreneurs also so that's that's why I want to see myself Li that's why you are growing the business to that level everythingis like a driving factor but not for the sake of se fancy clothes of antique cars its to be more impactful in the world my business is run by 6 gorillas to British to Americans the French a mistake but you will you get the point but it also space for an Indian player out the sitting among all of those of the size of population size of a population to know not just the size of a population in our business we exist to serve customersand we even if our clients business win again I suggest you know that the number one principal business when we when we also have the other principle which is a word is a bond because that guys primary amine you can leave contract suicide people hire people on trust higher soldier on trusting people hire soldier because they are very aspiration so other principals Creed work that people Aspire to write in a Santosh can you think so what are the values that really hold us together But coming back to the fact I thinkDin within the world a lot of the company is it located in Southeast Asia you look at in Africa and the Middle East the top companies in the world the marketing managers in the sea use all India so what happens in India in corporates also is that you go up the corporate ladder and then this corporate Sa then essentially if they don't get the top job in India the top job in Indonesia and Malaysia export of intellect export of intellect soNFC in this Indian wants to work with and Indian outside you may have local talent who is you know the creative talent to understand the culture but the guy who is running the business needs to be India so that's what we are doing essential images building out once upon a time we we keep saying this to our team should join us because we are you are a story is that we are going to be the first network that goes from India to the world God and bring the best of the world to India started doing some of that also now but that's how we takeoutside of India to the businesses that have grown and killed it on a national level how do you get to the next step how you get to the next thing is one is most business is fundamentally run on great leadership so you would I am right now grooming identifying hiring new leaders who can take out to the world God so that's that's fundamentally 1 and second is that you know I mean is Saman allergy the reset your soldier for hire how how good a soulin that market can you be one way to be a good soldiers and Chanakya also talks about this and particularly how he defeated Alexander the story of how defeated Alexander is primarily through observation because he saw that the troops were worn out and weak and not just that not a decadent fight but he saw that the main thing they were missing is away from home for too long was a missing their families and then he sent you know The Story Goes that he sent all of these people into his and women and kidsto that crowd so the soldiers of these women and children with side missing my family is even more than they were decimated so I mean you're not that we can do the same thing but you go and observe what happens in the market you can observe you can speak to customers large customers ask them what they pain points are you go and try to understand your customers are very smart people who run business is to hire Agencies are very smart they know what they want so you know that you keep constantly hearing that and I think that's where the Indian connection is lucky becauseplaces to see around me and Indian in this place in this company is always connected and disconnected to another India from the world like when you say I'm guessing you enter your event America that's the places your research I did I am researching more the Southeast Asian markets for example ok so my lessons there are more about you know I think so again what I try to do in the Southeast Asian markets can observe what is what is the limitation of the services they get there are sorelease with what we are doing in India and give me a lot of confidence that we need to basically take what we are doing in India out there but also have enough locate talent so you understand that more than you and your making a new American Indian entity that Indian entity with Global Heart so that's what we are trying to focus on right now and with the Europeans there was some interesting interactions that I had with the swedes ok so I did you know I am at about this journey and meet about 90 entrepreneursgay called Nicholas this Fantastic Group call founders alliance and I was interested with his thought process costing in electricity for semester I don't is grown up seeing that your company is not collaborating as much as they were competing at the end of founders Alliance is very different it's like you know the more collaboration have the stronger the mesh becomes an always helps another and amino group so with them again the you know that the thought process was very different because the Europeanvery clearly hai on technology hai on innovation they they don't get there they are very efficient but they don't get the service kind of focus that we have for in this part of the world less human more technical and and also this is don't have any bodies innocent so the way we look at talent and the way they look a talent is very different so they like every time I think about the fact that I've got a few people to do the same job so let me make it more efficient and let me think of Technologywe think you know people and process together will make it more efficient but you can take a Lil bit from that we were taken away from that so there's a second company that I am running which is the proof analytics which is the Indian arm of this Global company which is based in Phoenix Stockholm and now Bombay and Bangalore to be done with proof what we do if we essentially do a science called a marketing mix modelling in very simple wordstell large companies who spent over between 5200 Rose on marketing we tell them that on every rupees spent on marketing what was your return on television vs print vs digital so 1 Rupee in on TV give you how many Rupees out and 1 Rupee in an external give you how many Rupees out we do that to mathematical Modelling and we got you never do that through a combination of software which is built on a machine learning based platform and you know humandata scientist in the team who saw you do that so that's what I am fine alone from those guys like that a marketing strategies through starting numbers starting data patterns exactly and your running basically a marketing company because this comes back to it I don't serious I am in a series Two entities and I am sure if mark who is you are my Global CEO on roof V if he has thisthere are two different companies only I don't see those two different parts one part of the same Empire very easily on a personal level dude where's the spiritual aspect of you and there is a very strong sweater after marriage date for half an hour every day because a lot for like the average on the average Indian was always there for this happened once the banks are they happen know it he was always I am sometimes things just happenedso you and then you are grateful for the fact that they happened so this is Lady why work with Saloni Suri initiated a couple of workshops at our office at shooting and you know sheep introspector lot of figuring know where your weaknesses are things you can improve generally rethink what your vision needs to be or like clarify crystallize audio Vision is to be initiated yourmeditation with us at the time and I just remember feeling very at home while I was doing and continue doing it like again one was just happened you and not just about what you do with your money and then automatically it says dictating what you dotime so that started happening and then I becoming more and more close more and more inside myself and then as it has become more inside yourself then I'll another was the 40 books which we started with which was in the year that we ride on the IB program and I just realised they looked after that I hadn't really read at all so as to why is that so I am not able to focus and read and learn you know some of the gas you bring on your show you are saying who are you mentorscan also had a few but you know my mentors mainly I was like I got I may not have the greatest people in the world but they are all available on book so why am I not going and getting close to them something in me is already do that I am also you know this and and then also the fact aside realising the fact we spoke about the story of living foxymoron also my mind side telling me that you know you made the rightplease what the way you did it means you need to re question the way you think about your life so if you need to request the way you need to think about life in starts from everything starts with your habits and what you do so then all I mean that that's where all of that kind of came together if you know I am like I am essay does it just came together but all these things can be added to the five lessons you had in this year's building Sahab and what we learnt about life and surebut life don't wanna be alone and also your reading so can I am I am not sold I am just to I am young so I I feel like I don't have lessons I I just want to keep I want to keep improving myself I think maybe that's a lesson if you if you may like I feel like the moment it chase constant growth growth constant excellence constant like you know I could be better Universe you know you never feelwhat I've got is enough not from our point of view of lack of gratitude but from the point of view of look I have so much more to do at any hungry but never be greedy yeah yeah I think as one lesson The Other lesson is what you put in is very important so what you put into your body is very very important I thought I'd say this to you because I have something about dealing with right now which I really want to get rid of it 6 chocolate last night I can't get over myspeaker on this when we might also you know so that one friend deal with what you put in left side you know the kind of food we started putting in a cut of meat from my diet I felt like that make a big difference I cut out the smoking effect of the alcohol has been some time and what are you doing this why you by sacrificing so much I don't see it now as a sacrifice you know I am not seeing what is doing to me and I see myself I see myself waking up early oh I see myselfis is I'm tryna leave my all I feel like I am living a life and only the holiday from right and that's basically you know you somebody told me I see what hit the nail on the head for me for the smoking was a you are trying to get high because your hai na for life and I said no no that's not true if that's not true why I am really have a life I love what I am doing so you know so that's that was important to me and its need a big differenceI feel now so hopefully in the next few years we don't read something where are you know this get back on it but but I thought is important for me to parade also because it is made a big difference to my memory my cognition the speed at which I worked in the clarity with which I think so I think what you put in is very very important is it is important to ensure that you are what you eat that part will die also feel that dude because your metadata when you kind of follow the meditative lifestyle which is no means no alcohol no inimitation become more powerful meditation literally ads information to your mind is a very spiritual concept something that people will listen to those or may not understand this you will understand we meditate for at least half an hour for like a euro to you ok I think in different ways and new thoughts in my head I don't know I don't know what would you have anything to say about that you feel like it adds information to your head clarity you know you are so it I think what I feel when I amin meditation the only thing always go back to it brings you back to your purpose we always feeling of the layers and going back to your purpose in your going back to ok I was I am here for this what your purpose do so right now I mean there is little more but I should not be speaking at a time until I am not cross the first but this India to the world is my purpose right for you know this whole idea of taking is huge Army of supremely talented greatly principled well culture talented creative technologically soundIndian from here to view building a Shipping to all over the world and bringing the best of the world to India that's what my purpose is right now a step 1 and there is something beyond that but let me let me first get past this then I have the then have the licence to be able to even talk about what after that I don't know how far in via in your 5 learnings of life that keep going self-improvement together that ok you put it is important for the next sense of purposeAkbar 210 3rd yeah I think the other big lesson that I had is I think we need to have all of us need to have an alloy in terms of in terms of something else beyond the work that keeps us really fulfilled and a person know analysed in terms of luck I have music I love I love you music and now you know what I am I am learning to play the Sitar and doing my vocalsI love doing that I feel like that energy is me creatively feel like that's another big lesson I was not used to adjust long story short is I was one of those kids who is mum forced him to do music class when he was young and hated every discover that 29 found a Guru who is you got me back into classical music so I feel like that also helps you become more you found it for yourselfso that so this purpose have something beyond the work that forth and outside the other big learning is the really big long as I think you will learn to respect people for the beauty that is in them if you can see the beauty in people and that is what I am you why does a new lesson everyday we can see the beauty inside people and unlock most of that beautyfor service and to know the most important they get the best of people and accept them even with the weaknesses accept I feel she was beautiful and because you don't need to accept anything if they are you will show you was great about them all the time so you know you are really understated guy feel your to in the process so you don't talk about very larger-than-life things to talk about someone who is always in my mind that my legs bigger side in the world as a labourerok I follow him inside out on social media what every single interview like iPhone I am obsessed with the bronze into another degree and #gold strive for greatness lies always put the will power motivation Captain and is it really that guy is price for greatness Manish Pandey a mentor to me and a friend of yours I'm sure is meant to Divas at some point in some ways he was born in a basketball anyone watching Matches and he said that basketball 12 sports where everything aboutcomes out when the playing pretty Kota so small and really tell what they think with teammates were the settings of your position for the things of himself and he has also been watching Lebron is known for assisting like helping his teammates making them rise like a rock making the background and focusing on the beauty and at the same time when need be stepping up and coming at the centre 20 in assisting the scoring and sevika Samiti mails are not able to step up I do it is also very like flamboyant Gai so the way you said thatfind your purpose while you're talking about realise why do my was totally strive for greatness like be that focal point I Wanna Be Your Lover everybody who watches used for greatness that every morning with like the whole body but man from one Level to another level on HCF use Lebron and you so I'd really like to think on the same zone your just not a flamboyant division on YouTube in a sense of self YouTube But main is always a

like that but what was it like growing up as a character you enjoy one of the most so nice ambitious focus human being now thank you so so I were killed when you are an actor what was happening so I'll be honest I'm never seem like a normal childhood that's for sure and I don't know how it is and I've always wondered how it is but all my friends will Ek again not actors so I saw you know what they go through everything but I alwaysI am not is not like that I am like a you regret it was something I love my childhood and I don't think that I can imagine my childhood but do you feel like you got that will childhood even though you've always made sure that I am doing everything that so she always made sure I was workingI will doing TV shows ever so she always make sure made sure that it I'm going going to school regularly so I am not missing out on any school or my education in some that is something she always wanted me to go school go to school and I went to all the classes that are used to Katha class 9 9 your Kathak dancer also and she made me the good skating classes and karate classes in swimming classes sociology in each of them we all of those things so that wewho is that was likely the normal childhood but otherwise like even in school like that little extra attention that I used to get from friends and from teachers and being pampered onset and seeing the LimeLight and everything was I am very lucky to be experiencing all of that you remember working with Shahrukh Khan remember every moment with him because I was really goodso I was very cold chamber use do you know a lot of kids when they were like football scene happening and they were so many kids and used to make like everybody Run in a warm appenzeller we don't feel cold and there was a shot that I gave and heat wrap for meI know that he is very very humble to the position that he's even then he was really humble and nice and very hardworking and very focused this is something that like it was with me all this while so otherwise I don't remember much better than what was it like being directed by the future biggest producer in Bollywood Karan Johar back then very nice everybodyeverybody used to like Roli pamper me and they were like always Bieber in New York for 2 months on the last emperor of Barbie dolls and teddy bears and stuff from Karan Johar show that will surely he is really nice is also very fun to work funny man the god that you are the face of TVF now your literally one of the hottest digital stars in the Indian game right now how far you want to take this career like what you ultimate goalbut what you are doing right now this is something that I never planned and never saw it coming so I didn't know that is going to be rescued and is going to work so well for me I am very satisfied and am really happy where I am right now on the digital level and I would definitely like to continue this but again as I told you that my main goal is to get into Bollywood and become a Bollywood actress but as far is whatever I am doing rightlove to continue doing this because a very safe and it's really fun and interesting space to be a growing growing Roli fast and for an actor especially so huge opportunity to like you know 2 different kinds of also because I like being in TV add on all kinds of different different character given me a lot of chances and a given me a lot of good work good projects so I would definitelycontinued to this even if it for Netflix or Amazon or any other platform not only TVF I mean position right now my question to you is sleep now this so much growth on digital how come your site still looking at things like Bollywood has always been a childhood dream of me thatblack as when I did Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna Vastu Shastra I always had these and I want to become a Bollywood heroine was always there is never left even if I did a lot of TV or digital or anything that's never left and again I would like to do because I've been always you know wanting it and dreaming about it so I would obviously want to try it out I would not want to like give up on it that something you working towards right now that is something totally working towards even though unlike superbdigital I am doing also if it it if it's Instagram or anything but that is something I'm constantly working towards your age of work and time part in a network can be built at parties and it is always going onit make it big in the media world to be you and I really don't like to party is always been a very realistic mother so you still confused now and she wants me back and so she is always the whatever Like even if I am not going to drug level you see a lot of drugs aroundok I'll be ok but we don't talk anymore like you seen the building ko can be said that not that has spread all over the life of the face of the weekrecognising that my heart you want told me that like 10 ultimate ambition in life is to not be around the house that of famous even be working towards that was on it going to happen but right now because your like the face of TVF are you everybody knows you how does it feel getting so much attention like that already like I think people who crowd around using Ocean as entered the room think like that I love it was travelling by auto and I will adjust pass like a random girl and she screamed my namegive me like I really felt amazing about it would come to a point where people actually know my name is like that film I love it I kind of feel that both digital and Bollywood are kind of slowly Goa be at the same levelright now but Cena 2025 2005 fame and I think you are worried that what I call you know just crazy level of Fame eventually am I questioned you right now about like dating let's make this like Koffee with Karan style is there is there any person in your life right nowright now stop looking for it deliberately like making an effort to like find the guy or anything if somebody comes along and create happy if this concept of dating I know for a fact that there's a lot of guys all around you who want a dativ Swan askew breaking away from the astronautwhat does the 2011 National look for in a guy and I can'tfellow arm yourself with that you have a lot of knowledge that knowledge will come to youusing your boyfriend's to basically better yourself hot look for like looks do you think that's why do you think thatI don't know about other girls but I am I the only thing that Fame or stable relationshiphungry for like if I don't get what I want like my Fame over that I had planned by 26 I will not get married or by 30 I will not you consider yourself for failure of that happens if I don't think that I will actually feel I will do something I'll figure out and manage something I am saying that lie for me work is always a private I have to like anything else are doinghard work at your traffic even better acting auditions in the second half with this positivity that you have my next question to you is because we reference Koffee with Karan ask you about Karan Johar right now so with Dharma Productions you know like launching nexo many people and the whole nepotism debate that have you tried reaching out again to him ok okplatform right now he's got a big man that I mean I am sure it's not very easy or it's not possible for him to meet like everybody and I am not it's not him it's the people who work for him lying under him so they will not let you like creature black know that if I meet him at a party tomorrow and if I go meeting I am sure it's such a nice man is such a great man that he will always like be really nice to me for a reminder like to remember I will Arjun from Kabhi Alvida na Kahanalittle difficult if you do if you reached him then is great I am in his definitely would entertain me and be really nice to me because I believe that I've seen him on TV screen is reality shows are seen in judge people on reality shows and I know he's a good person so you know like a bi I get that really good bye from him but just reaching is difficult because he's at such a big platform in his like such a big man right now I can I completely get that it's not that I'm complaining anybody for thatis really difficult to reach such a big man but I really really respect and appreciate him for the work that he is doing and what is become right now if I told you ki you know if you are a transfer model your career based on like someone who is like currently in Bollywood wood model at all like the rules that she doesn't everything but I also really looked up to Radhika Apte because she is not from a Bollywood backgroundis like an unknown celebrity kid and she still come up on some amazing projects and she is truly want her like in terms of a book strategy your Gopal but that and I want to come back to TV app now Saathiya literally the single biggest like Media company in India Today I think they probably the single biggest one my question to you is working at TVFlike because you didn't want TV from the beginning to join TVF now you now you become the crucial part right now you like the face of it the front end of it so what is the work culture like at TVF like you are really really generous to me because they've given me so much work in the back to back sketches and that's how I become a face and that they've given me like really big shows like Kota and Hum Tum and all so thethere is like very like you go to that office you will not feel like an officer will display it like a family everybody is like having so much fun they are all right there is such a in westbury were like playing Cricket in the common area in the something going on there in some people screaming in its start it is now become my second family I go there is so much and even though I am not an employee but I just feel like I'm in love it's alwaysI am reading or Face Unlock test something really nice to work with and the best part about it them is like the when the very open to feedback I think this is the reason that is so great that always open to the employee feedback on everything given me like I am not an act to write a rise but if I have some feedback they will always like you know consideredthink about it and discuss it so I think that is Rolly Rolly open everything and during its like a very fast office to work very fast like the everything and the so many things happening in the something going on this some discussion going on there are about something that you working on something and the next month is actually happening your own it is a very very fast also write andirrespective of whatever controversy happened around them what they like being the same room as him because he's literally getting the biggest modern media on the best part about Ramayana think this is what I really love about him is that he talks to everyone like any even if there is a new employee in the in the company he will text that person and you know ask my OK what issomething going on and on my birthday party the other day and I really nice of you to come so he came and I have developed a lot of TVF people as well so overall like they were also having fun but I saw him going to like everyone and having like a 15 minute conversation with everybody which I really like about them and because he talks to you he wants to know that is why is being Evil has been able to live in such a big company and even with me like I hadn't met himblack before before the party like a couple of times before the party but the the first time we actually spoke Wheels on Instagram and we had like a whole conversation in really appreciate so he also really appreciate and encourages you give your really honest feedback and if it on a sketch of a character that I played so that we he is really like he goes and speak to you and he gives his feedback and we ask for your feetand I think that's probably his founder mentality that gone into like all the layers of TVF that we problem interiors open to all the feedback from people for the content but again let's come back to like the most serious aspect of your life which is your career you know you made it big again on digital and that shows a lot of jealousy around you there is negative emotionsa lot like what is following me for no reason talking and your friends and peoples and follow me anything that I don't know why do and like people other girls are you natok sheethuman beings and communication skills play in a carrier like Bollywood of media effects effects important to be charming charming and I feel that you just need to like talk if you like it used to be a person who wouldn't talk who is quiet and just listen that you set a good listener so I am a good listener but then I realised that it's even work if you just have to put your you have to put your what you thinkand if you don't all people will think every To Matlab she's like just she doesn't talk to you really have to be very active rahata personality very important TVF changes your life your Where are happening in TVM happened over the next three things that you've learnt to apply for the rest of my life on yourself like this is what I really like that there are a lot of people in TVF that have been linked directly to meflex falana saw them with the very open the to set themselves not fake So being fake is something that you know people don't like people don't like like I would like an especially in the industry for fake people really like the cat that is really like this way you just need to be really really natural and you have to be yourself an honest and you also have to be very manipulative you can positive in a positive way butbeing manipulated for something good if you want to give your opinion on something on your feedback on something to be very positive about it like it in your period that could cause the manipulation point in Punjabi velvet locatedlet there be more people who rejected megorgeous birauli natural and just say what you feel and don't know I'd got too because you are from the media industry embroidery mirror and sitting and rapid fire round at the end of this podcast at the annual podcast so a Lego Ranbir Kapoor aur Ranveer Singh Alia Bhatt aur kapdedirector that you like to Anurag Kashyap a dream role that you think you could have done better than someone who direct I could into better but I would love to do geet from Jab We Met you would not do it better but I would like to do it is the guy in the acting digital acting worldsexiest Gai Le Gai will be ok and the hottest will be free for overall package I don't know that I hadscratch on Jeetu OK your ultimate personality trait and other than being well read on this be honest I didn't hear them being honest and well read personality of a funny guy would be finesense of humour for your boyfriend has everything else that I like complete you understand I understand that like understand methat like how I think that I mean that impossible but it's this Lake one thing you never told anyone else in your life that even a review on this podcast for person born in 1928 wash my legs like like like I don't put soap on my life that like you know which is that it's not requiredplay Scrub my life ok next question tubelight biggest insecurity I won't be as good as and also like for getting acting how to act I think both are possible and this is coming as a bro because like do you already read like a second stage of life safety in your career and your to 10 tables your talent as wellso that happened but is there any forget like your career is a new security your personal life and I know that I will at some point but this is that I can't imagine my life I think about it if

black a good actresswill not let you down I will work Roli Roli hard it's always been my dream to work with you please Kashmir Unix film you won't lose anything if you had a genie in a bottle water which three wishes good first is the Bollywood actress Manju like him for Fame for Fame never losing my mother and going back to December 2018white just awesome OK Google some people think that what happened in December 2008 and things better and save a lot of things but I didn'tfloor and I just took a lot of things for granted and that's I lost a lot of what is namequestion just like a closing note on the entire Potash your friend and one thing you keep things you think that your time is like parson you by what you just 20 people's career zone Star Today Live 26 27 you are like even 3-4 hours later you still be super young so I think you should care about that two people applying noticed you right now and you what if the lot more than other people can dream of achieving at Liberia 23 Vada dream life till now ok bye growing apply Dazzlergetting my family I am getting success also making money as a 2011 and good money for ok I want to ask your question actually why do you feel that your time is passing you by is it like its own devices that I tell you that order event only feel at home inside but I also feel that I'm really passes and I just feel that so many days that I've wasted not workingI am also like this role of Lord of time even in December 2018 famous been very insecure about myself for no reason things that I have an 2016 2016 time that it's calledrealise and realise this really late and backlight problem due to the last one I have to use that as you grow up you have these bouts of insecurity and yourself down every three to six months and as you grow up to become more stable from the inside the next time the insecurity creeps up with a light over top of its happening again in my life and then eventually make peace with the do you realise is that time of the year where you know I started out in myself it happened to every woman being included Mukesh Ambani and Narendra Modi every one of them but isthe sooner you learn to live in a look and say that dude you know I am still is this will be chal so the next time your feeling like insecure and that's the sleeping and remember that you are the biggest digital start my country today ok and a lot of people know you are a lot of people are betting on you so just remind yourself that you are a great zone in life this and sometimes you just need outside perspective we need someone to hold a mirror at you and say that listen this is why you are in life to chill out Manana good zoneJodi Lo and bad about myself and black encouragement I just talk to you all have gone on to use things in life so just keep going man like everyone's eyes are honest and one closing no to everyone just like a biggest Life lessonVikhroli work hard like work hard to forget that is keep working hard because you look you will not even know that you are about to lose it and don't take things for granted if it works is relationship or even of friendship and spend time with your parents really spend time and to sit down and talk to see what it really is like recently that there are times that we don't just like that so many things are parents want to tell us and they just want to have like a one-on-one conversation with us if it's not like a specific topicjust want to talk to us to do that because there will be a time when you won't be able to do it and you'll regret it the most gorgeous and its time and I've I am I am lucky that I realised I am 24 people usually realise when the 40 40 years old and I think you are serious is someone who has the mentality of a 25 26 rule at the age of 20 I

there are a few key points you need to know especially for college students especially if you want to build your career on social media firstly understand that Mumbai is a financial capital of the country for the reason the college students your follow the Tiktok vs YouTube fight closely the college students here on Bigg Boss closely the college students your follow the emiway vs Raftaar kind of fights very close ki kya because the board to the lack ambitionI don't know what they're doing the life when you come out of college when you at the age of 22 that when you know I want to do this with my life and mostly used in the most professionals in the city don't give about Tik Tok YouTube about emiway Raftaar fights about Bigg Boss everyone focuses on their own Industries their own careers and that's why Mumbai is the financial capital of this country proud to be a citizen of Mumbai I am very concerned with my own world my own work I don't need drama and my life is in of drama andhead because I want to go to the next level in my life now have a youtuber speaking about carryminati is more than a brother to me you had some intense heart to heart conversations and I really feel bad about his video being taken off from YouTube standpoint understand what is like you when you create something and then it just gets ignored the very painful that happened to me in the past The Fever videos I just hope the best forearm specifically in terms of the Tik Tok versus YouTubeaviation I really feel that it wasn't really a platform was platform situation it was a creative is create a situation that blew out of proportion peoples are and perceiving that has not won the National level fights blown out of proportion but the truth for you is that 500 million Indian to begin using the internet most of them are not going to use YouTube they will Discovereventually in their life right now the only going to discover Tik Tok because the people close to them are using Tik Tok right now open Tik Tok it's primarily small town India that on Tiktok with villages around Tik Tok also that were the money is to be made just so you know that two ways to make very big money in this country one you sell out side the country to outsource your product to sell to yourself or up to you sell to the interiors of India ok it's not that easy to crack the USin fact the whole world is looking at India synthesizer populations in the size of taxim 500 billion population of Guru come on the Internet and think I want to create products of this country braunau am rich and rare Indian coins of focusing on those five hundred million people in focusing on the Tik Tok orders were looking at the audience and calling them names saying things like Osha this order in this old user is using the tall they don't know anything and all educated and well-being all cool about using YouTube listen to YouTubeYouTube audience I also create Tik Tok videos ok Je liya built out an audience that my goal is to change the country yes I am 10 ultimate in the leaders of the country which is the YouTube watching order NSE 50 years from now you guys will be at the top in businesses in industries that my goal is also the spread education to the corners of the country that my only reason for doing Tik Tok numbers but I'm at a stage my Grave I don't give up on numbers I give the growth of my business idea about creating an impact inAndaaz going to happen when you talk to the rest of the country if you or someone social media query it can be as a social media influencer as a video creator as a businessman who has an agency like Monk entertainment you are going to have to be on Tiktok why is honestly YouTube is extremely Saturday right now it take a lot for you to break out and YouTube is a lot of work to be honest ok it's not everyone's cup of tea Sabki bus Ki Baat Nahin Hai remember thatit took me a long time to crack this YouTube gamer seen the youtubers struggle and not an easy gameplay Tik Tok is much easier at this stage of social media training if I am to give seminar to someone if I am to tell someone to take about social media career I will tell them that if you can't do YouTube go for it is a great platform to build an audience will build the most beautiful most loyal most loving audience but if it's numbers that you won't go for Tiktok as well I never sayYouTube only true Tik Tok is not like that YouTube is difficult to crack Tiktok is easy to crack it makes sense as an engineering engineering engineering graduate see the easiest case scenario in all your situation the Royal Challengers extremely easy to crack the Tik Tok given why should you crack the social media given the first place remember that throughout the coronavirus situation to the lockdown to industries that benefited a lot in terms of money and numbers Overseas Healthcaredoctors anyone related to medical professions and the second a social media people y f distribution channels and needs that tomorrow if I start a clothing line because I'm YouTube I will have a distribution channel to this podcast hu Hindi channels Hu Main Tik Tok viral we will tell people hate thank you for loving me for so long by the way up created this Kickass product through which you can consider buying if it appeals to you need distributionespecially in the near future of the next five ten used to be able to sell any product people on Garmi heading out of the houses that much but they are going to be heading out of the house to the mobile phones to Tik Tok through YouTube ok very crucial for everyone to have some social media skills in the modern day that hope you going to sell a product that can become the new form of marketing influences like me social media stars and benefit a lot but their needs to be the next gen of social media stars as well as soonwhich is the superior social media platform that I am not understanding that is not about YouTube vs Tiktok it's about who is the smartest influencer or creative your what's the future of India the future of India's multiple social media platforms it already is the present you got Instagram that almost everyone is all you got YouTube that almost everyone John and you got Tik Tok which a lot of people gravitating towards even the fancy urban South Bombay South Delhi peopleusing Tiktok nowadays YouTube vs Tiktok fight is no clear winner but if you understand the creator of distribution channel and the winner in the Tiktok vs YouTube fight only you both the platforms are growing learn how to build a social media Kari autumn very very simple not under this video if you want me to start a series well-educated guide on how to begin your social media careers it's really really a step-by-step processnow the final point I want to talk about his money Rashid and detailed business analysis of YouTube vs Tiktok on Hindi channel I'll give you a quick summary both the platforms have a lot of money in the future as of now youtubers a way ahead in terms of money compared to people create videos on Tiktok with everyone around for a while because we have a lot of loyalty and depth when it comes to audience Tik Tok mostly has only numbers yes they have a loyal fan following butand are not the people who spend big money when the going shopping chances are that the YouTube audience has a higher spending power that's why the YouTube currently in terms of brand value is more valuable as compared to the Tiktok as of now ok to use three years later some smart Tik Tok exactly build out of very good brand like a Bhuvan Bam like a Prajakta Koli like a be unik then maybe thingdifferent and don't think that the current of youtubers want builder brands for the day I gonna keep taking the games for the as well but what do you supposed to do you want to win this game create a brand be on multiple platforms and also very crucial is what people don't understand LinkedIn and Twitter have the big futures in terms of business in terms of money in terms of growth the influences are able to track those two platforms along with Tiktok in YouTube will be the real one knows if you can do all four do it a lot of workuse one rule for local life is not about striking when the iron is hot it about making the iron hot through your striking work so hard outwork everyone so that you put yourself in the best possible position to kill it in life to Grab the opportunity to be known as the best in what you choose to do the best in your genre and it's not going to happen if you spend time on consuming Dramas that are going on in this world does not happen if you spend timeyou mean the fights are happening All Around The one big boss of these big rap battle that happen online injoy app Android Bigg Boss Wafa don't watch it for the fights enjoy carryminati for the kind of content it makes a don't get consumed by the fights focus on your own growth is a reason Mumbai is the financial

exactly two points and Imagine problems and therefore starts on the get on the apartments at your problem that you will pay for money for that problemcore need is to be curious to know thanks but do I really know it can only be tested by 5 interfaces are friend right so blessed business is the application of knowledge because knowledge for the sake of marriage is not as valuable because you are not tested it write a in India as to the application of Gyan is everything at believe that otherwise not just for youyes we want but most people are so addicted to just listening to Gan motivation staff 100 things in life that to me is the biggest problem of India was a summarising it that way too much knowledge way too much can a very few people trying to apply and improve that completely agree while I do feel the staining was right before the supporters started I give you the Gyan that I give Most Wanted30 which is that A 27 year old and a guy even in his late thirties away more similar in India compared to that 27 year old and the 22 year olds of this country that's because of the impact of the internet or I mean I want I want I want to ask you a very broad question feel freelancer in whatever way you wish to answer what is Indian 2016 look likewhy do we have an extraordinary bright future or a very dark one reason is that what capitalism has done the world has become like a 1-bit superconductor write all of us are connected to each other and the way to understand this is a simple joke becomes popular instantly right that everybody knows about the job saying the joke next day also is not cool because I don't is not the world is connectedthis product very very fast and because of that when innovations come this spread very very fast as well right and sometimes they take away jobs right and then we are not prepared for that change quickly the skills that we have will be relevant very quickly India in this unique cause of terrible education system not having The curiosity myself too lowright fundamentally the world will therefore take away the jobs and automate them but the job losses will happen in India because the world is connected right so and American becoming more efficient is taken away at job in India and we don't even understand this connection right now for exampleto home but now they realise that all the homes are out social cause a given to India but now we cannot format this stuff because people are doing it on your own and Happy covid-19 all the celebrity has not become text sali home builders of jobs at on what they not gone in the US in India right to use the jobs are getting accumulated in poor countries and in 26unless we stuck on models in big black flag North Korea Cardiff imagination when we are only creating and we are only used it can maintain is going to be very very hard now the positive side of this is that we have a very very ignition problem the youngest In All the Nations and if people figure out the delete Loni to depend on education system to become smart and learn skills and just that basic skills taught and habitatmind I think you will learn how to crack things I think creating an entrepreneurial mindset the country's biggest cause is that we all job seekers write a if you can Google top 10 keyword searches every day or two of the top 10 to our government exams and that is the level that I am worried about that everybody just hoping for that one government job the problem with the government does not need songplease understand the largest employer of the world is an efficiency and remove in efficiency of jobs are gone right and the problem is the skills that we had so many jobs in India not required to lift ban on ATM watchman liked the probability that the number millions of people guarding 80Marwadi people stop using cash what happens then right so we are just not ready our education system synopsis there are dependent on agriculture is way too high and one most scary factor which nobody pay attention to the number of women working in labour force is dropping every year ok less than 10% of urban Indian women workIndependence lower than Pakistan this is lower than Bangladesh Bangladesh 68% at 8% China is at 90% right and because I look at how many compartments in Metro for women vs men when you stand Rush Hour94% all credit cards on beiman beiman not fundamentally understood that their of early patriarchal and aggressive Nation because I want to get data and industry partners every year the female participation of levels drop in not increasingwrinkle be the catalyst to change all this has to be your solution and this is where your maybe the entrepreneurial side of people like yourself to take in the blood of socialism and capitalism and socialism really easily for the listener in the basic termscapitalism is very simple you use capital to produce markets are employment people the host it focuses on wealth innovation is awarded disproportionately to one inventor and advancement and affection of 1 Businessman wonder if the do good stuff and therefore the overall the suicide increases right but socialism unfortunately has failed everywhere in the world and India salwar adapted to this is that there anything is governed by the stateshared equally so that if a pattern is made in India you don't get the benefit of it is assumed to be a public covid-19and somebody who is not saying after the rules of inference that but this and that and fundamental concept is not good for youa complete overhaul of education system of government syncing to relieve prove that because the government somehow operates also the socialists and said because the country held in the centre for like the loss of subsidies and and all of that stuff which does not create wealth and other problem is most part tax comparison 30 40 million people were doing their jobs at Ek tax is a lot of businesses who are in capital marketbut the thing is that we have still the minds of their PSU job legitimate subject kam ho jaaye that the Manchester of IT in her life to you what about story about 10100 jobs today live 1 crore applications like that can of Mind set the operating with and the country is fundamentally statistical more than bat CG Indian craft very very popular story story that there is a story is that one guy goes to workcontainers well cars are stored and one container is kept open and the opena well presented and collaborator and understand this because you've never seen a collaborator side stand India is not one country India has 25 countries most become one country and therefore we have no need for neutral that forms list example of neutral platforms on YouTubecricket lot of India and its neutral and English neutral beverage is tea and coffee not fermentum are then I have a party office nutrifood the ordinary the media is not from India biryani.com India in fact I will discover that you want to visit from India reallycall is from the East China Nepal Kaspersky endpoint not realise that the need for this country to come through neutral that forms for example acid blood cultures and you also bad same language a Gujarati Gujarati Punjabi Punjabi fundamentally all the kids are born after that will be Englishbecause the neutral platform that connects a Gujarati to alphabet in Bengali in English write anything we don't realise and accept these days and BF confused between self fighting elections on the old topics are stuck on some old principal at the reason we are like that is that nobody is incident future everybody is happening celebrity past write the fact that we're stilllisted building Statues Of some old people for creating some things to take a lot of money to build some of the stuff about past Glory every time asking Nations super obsess about that past are used to tell you about their future lot of the things you are saying actually Echoes this book am reading victim dead sure you've already read it call to anyone lessons from the 21st Century by yuval NoahFerrari and I know for a fact that you are a very had read and considering everything that you said I have a couple of points to acting at a point 10 question so I was recently hanging out with this Colombian girl we were she was the cinematographer the shoot was at its been in India for 6 months of documents the conductive covid-19 you notice about India that separates it as a society that was different what the people you are beautiful things like spiritual sensibilityand empathy and universe sense of warmth and friendliness but she is like this way too many internal battles people having you are so what do you mean that insecurity is a known in security is like everyone has an ego about themselves and the sense of he was extremely strong you that again because your status driven point that you made by alien fighting for IV should be respected one I should be respected more remember only on one at ko founded 1failed startups with someone that guy had told me specifically the do the one thing I look for in my own Kari always a respected want money I do if I want respect and I told him ok but the thing about the YouTube by that point and automatically getting the Bhav everywhere he went on getting the attention and that's why he cannot drifted even as a co-founder and then we thought we'd over your house ignored wasn't respect it was this ego massage like it because I mean that that that would mask itself wasman and you know this kind of Concept which are very deeply ingrained in our culture and the second thing I want kind of talk about his in that book The spoke about how throughout the last 200 years has been capitalism and socialism and communism and all these different governance systems where every country resort a system is the best and gradually scene all of them fail in one way or another thought that capitalism was the answer that Americanmodel of the answer and optionally brexit happening America elected Donald Trump think the collapsing area so there is no answer any more and you are you are is in tuition is that the whole World Is Gonna Move back to what it was an ancient times in terms of China's go back to his own ancient version of itself when they had one government ruled everything the things that we are the shit not just in China all over the world Russia think that this could be one Za which is gluten India might become a CAKingdom just like it was that Sandy Rakhi written about this in the book to read the bookunless we accept the well we will send out beforeso wonderful notice something about all the people who have played over there will always do thiswhy are you like that what is all the kimberley what is the income growth because that's how many countries income per capita is gone from 2000 to 15 August not accepting that for the nation to your pan by will probably good example 500 years ago the person who entertain you stupid for the personwhat entertained but they found distributionwhat is education you tell me not everybody is running on zoom zoom why should be taught by the best teacher of India to everybody in this country and this one could be a one hard question to answer because if you do that everybody would like to this extraordinary did it nowwhat about all the other millions of teachers group in teaching physics or right hand and suddenly this creates well in the teachers and teaching profession is one thing all the YouTube teachers are really good physicsteacher day had power and respectbehave differently family to behave differently to know if the world needs for many people what things are watching a documentary talks about this before the horse Corporation Bank letters that are came the population is went down in tennisvery scary portable Suman beings are not horses so suddenly we have to keep you in their free income to survive will they be happy with that and entering fairly scary possibility is that we don't even have the mechanism to prevent the Civil unrestwhat if it's not what is coded as 50% of jobs for long tail and what is we are not going to get them like they also take cabs the millions of drivers are not having a job what happens now write something is the moment a country become emotionally charged you do not know what are commit created because it behaves like a mob of that and it to me2064 India kam se kam hot think because they want to go to a lot of pain before we get there and the fun story but in every country that made it big First went through in same amount of crisis it almost looks like it's compulsory after before you come to life 100% of which also a cause a scary thought they read the bookwhich is that the next war is always going to be a civil war within countries countries on Fire ID sell its just that with the nature of mankind that the worst and most pivotal was in human history always when a brother fights of brother as a new fight enable all the future was possibly according to the trajectory of we are going to be within countries I can I close all the source we spoke with this whole concept of artificial intelligencebecoming a crucial part of mankind taking away our jobs Europe the concept of retail actually been to a molecule in the shop to buy something with 3D printing everything at home all these concepts are probably going to let a lot of people remain jobless and even yuval Noah harari exposes the world have no answer the way I look at it I kind of feel that men and this is the Optimus inside me talking I will humanity will finesolution in some way will that be right there will be a very good model of communism socialism the government takes very good care of its citizens I don't know what the model will be but my big hope and is something I feel strongly about is that the next Facebook of the world and the next Amazon of the world might come out of this country and other also of law of India where you know we always aim to create National businesses and not international business but do you agree with your it is something like thatpossibly the next startup which will revolutionize everything in the world can come to the next virtual reality startup can come out of yourwhat's your plan after Stanford in all of the above and back brace are going to be leaving the country that the the tricky part of socialism company right if you feel that as a taxpayer the country start rewarding you back the Bombay Bangalore contribute to large chunk of taxes but what are the taxes contribution back to city is very very low because there were a lot of people to take care oftell you like to score now in Columbia and and andtalent and Udacity and money and product mindset is something that is extremely hard right had negative Lok Global community of the engines so exposure we forget that all the Indian that we are proud of have changed the citizenship long have you lived abroad there are way more Americans than engines but there is a cancer colleges in KollamLori write so is called you are happy KR Google Google Casio IndiaCommando substitute that we have to take care of her on the longitudinal wave of my one is that the brain drain that is happening constantly in scary it is happening in my soul that people that smart 3 plus I have hired have now moved to broad and working in big companies like who was quantified all these places and unlike and destructive losing people who are really good then who is building thewrite the scary pop and white is school and national Society of the time butElectronic Communication site to get a cab companies of e commerce companies or payment companies right fundamentally we are not able to keep up and computing with them the thing is that how to become Global companies by the sheer ruthlessness of the share relentlessness that we need to make a bit and the amount of capital and talent required if a problem like you do not be there was a great talent in work anywherethe country where people can stay be enjoying the time would love to have the kids space Olympiad questions of heart and as a nation we are conflict between the small book that leaves are there in Singapore and the rest of the nation that visit after come and join them to the elaborate Indiathe state of India right that is now blessed medical care is not there would you want to be locked down during covid India or abroad if life really opened up during the Universal Public go in countries are likely to have more better health care for those are the question which are harder to answer and it's not and governments had a long time we just start coming at Delhi government governmentthe problem is country is built by the people all the available on YouTube how much people read and write their having to constantly dumbed down content so that it makes sense to people but the point is that you are compete in a global world we are making textbook easier to understand your making videos easier to understand we are summarising books that people understand wanted but yetGlobal talent how are you going to win it is that are still set our talent is not keeping up and generosity is this very very low and everybody things ke padhaai ho gai but in the world will end you can never say because you have to constantly up your game to be relevant in the game right are you can thus a degree in factextremely relevant but I give people who are currently in colleges bad news do you know I man the so many things I want to say right now right from the fact that back when I was in college I feel like parental psychology was very different from the parents of college students today weather AC 3 tier YouTube Avengers whatever your social media business school and the thinkingthat's a positive I do feel that you know how we getting a brain drain so who's actually leave the country it like open Kids maybe tio2 kids not really interiors on a visit at the money to leave now just my experience in the sum of a pivotal highest have been from the interiors of India including during the pandemic where I had to actually fire some long time people at organisation because they were too expensive and they weren't working as well as someone who could have one third theand would do triple the amount of work so that my personal big hope you like those kids need to be taught concept of entrepreneurship leadership even very human concepts like your like this thinking that larger relentlessness things like that my question to very quickly it as your previous question but I'd love to hear your opinion on this week today at and Jeff bezos net worth cross 200 billion dollars what cansitting in a village in India are you never know what can that get loan from Jeff bezos in terms of a mindset and adopt if he has become the basis of Indiateacher understanding the world and how it operates its Job responsibility thatand I will see that there is simple thing is you are not going to make it big if you do not understand not when you call me when you do not understand what is the business what to the principles of a business how many people are curious about understanding like jio Kaise chalta what is the revenue model what is the average are you don't know this board is also and I'll be waiting for education system to teach us the stuff because by the time you thatgo to college all the water level in Delhi where isthe talking about y combinator how to start a Startup in specificwrite anything but there is more to figure out a search for almost every home camera setup badminton Mein yah Kaise khelna haipoint is the need and curiosity is just not there and we are very happy getting a status from Ms Tik Tok videos and likes and another problem is that not everybody can write briefly forget that no matter what we are seen in a country with low trust there is always going to be 25 companies who have all the prophet 25 Bollywood that will have all the prophets500 only uses the thing is sure to really break out and create new territories in India inheritance was always share so naturally when person dies the plan was referring to Sun and inheritance with a different controversial topic but in the West the concept was first born first inheritance IIgo and do expiration together property and capturing in Indiaoutside the church is it possible that all the given higher status more than the king and they were buried inside the churchwhich is not made the heroes andcreate bulk heroes people employees to have stocks in the complete the work for you don't have a concept and understand the concepts in stock market 20 million people in 1.0yeah one of just bring into three concepts from passport Kas mentor mind doctor Radhakrishnan Pillai uski speak about the concept of conviction ki with ancient India was the first subjects were taught in junior KG you were taught to locate an object and ask yourself why is object shaped like this Why is it not shaped like this which is against the same contribution that why is that ideology kind of left us Somewhere Over mediaeval times I think it left us which is somethingspoke to with Amish Tripathi about so he basically said that it was something on it was this whole again it ego game making sirf fighting each other before society got destroyed and the third thing I want to talk about is again the present times there was this conspiracy theory I read about how not all Warfare is physical so you can have was like between two Nationstanks and missiles and play in the soldiers killing each other or you can have psychological Warfare and the big conspiracy is that has China started psychological Warfare in India by introducing Tik Tok in this country and by introducing pubg in this country side firstly my question to you is let's hear your thoughts and psychological Warfare and what you think of the conspiracy and the second question is what you think about giving in general and during gaming is benefitspoiling the future of the youth of this Nation to find clause in people and their first reaction is to blame somebody else they are not really reflecting on water problems as a country we should stay away from all the people who sell conspiracy theories to ask because their method to gaindo not idolize people because they give you the body through which you can gather and combine them The Reader you are you question every single thing right and unless you question every single thing you'll always be manipulated because the human brain does not like to bol energy fatafat shortcut on desktop have you checkedit is the opposite of never forgetting that we keep dressing up like prince and princess for last 56 years wedding what is that isn't a statusneed to ask these fundamental questions and any time the shortcut answer that comes to mind the first and is able to detect and asked the question we will keep shifting from conspiracy theories of the brain font shortcut shortcut very very short and this is our country's biggest problem we have never been trainedoptical wanting any country the default respect elders is done because your mentalitysexual how many people have question why should Raksha Bandhan exist that wherever you go society we will have so much about it because it's normal to not be messed with anything that created that there is a value for backup site but if you do not questionalways be ruled by the next person who can give us your story right to become well we will always be manifesting what we truly are right our country to apply for PR people say that a Bollywood movie Kaisa should movie I like how can people like that stuff but we understand that those who is make 200 croreaverage IQ of a country has Pedro and what have you done to improve that we can keep that in so many people from Netflix on the Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah CIDouterstuff questions take a foods to relieve the valve mind we are not going to get better at the biggest problem is about worship worship Karenge because his question the thought about this and what are you stop coronavirus long wire following people and like we keep moving from left for the garageWhat is means of what everybody is bar why are you not questioning why you're not seeking truth is very hard to learn later life because I don't ask children from schoolwhat was the most interesting questions to ask today not imagine the power that one single Virtually every day that the son or daughter thinking as mein kaun sa question and question that teachers and decided coming smart bands Mata have been to Israel and it's been a it's been one of your life experiences that stays withforever that country is just different and I feel there like at the aerotape when it comes to human progress in the world but go on please I'm sorry to interrupt to youwhat is this important that world learning something from at the point of going abroad and eating the same food at their home or hang out the same people who have not within Bombay anyways how many Indians travel alone anywhere in the life so wellart of a groupuntil sometime while that was a heavy answer I think the core kind of inside I got is change the culture change the culture right from the top have have have the p.m. the educators telling people to explore people to accept people to question with a doubt it will happen in the next 40 to 50 years but in saying that you never know how social media is group and will it actually be a situation where you define number100 YouTube subscribers will be very normal for Indians considering the fact that we have the biggest population in the world will be had this really powerful social media influencers / Bollywood actors who will influence society that my optimistic outlook on it but the question as to bring you back to is the big gaming question you know whole pub ji wave that going on I want someone who is considered like what society would Caldwell the and successful considerfact that you as both the statins and the wealth game was your outlook on ABS IT kind of helping kids develop you know incidence of them so it is obviously doesn't have to reflections at right but how much does your reflexes matter in terms of setting up of wealthy family life you know like that what I want to know that like what it actually doing for you as a person also keep in mind just generally the gaming community is extremepossessive about what they are protecting which is the ideal for outdoor I want a career in gaming angry killed in gaming and why game is a growing industry in the world with very aware of that your someone who has an outlook on the modern startup world future of this country what's giving doing to the youth of the populationcan I build biceps by just doing something for 2 minutes is a way to do that it's not that I will need to give hours and died and months of effort to be able to get a good body so anything that is worthwhile X deliberate effort for hours and months and years on time Olympian gold medalist by adding quick there nohave to give hours and hours of practice become good at a single exam know we have to give hours and hours of contribution but what happens is that the brain food Mall shopskeep doing this all day long right now it says that you are 361 stuff that you like one that you like to be good at and fo-dicom assume it is about water worldmoney for every serial YouTube YouTube that we do not understand that some professional are fundamentally Limited for CO2 well how will you be beerbiceps podcast leave letter for 5 years because I Like To Main Kuchh Karega and help you do it but you can't because500 thing that can be knows what is gay that he is not a document it is brain out every single thing that you done my biggest worries that we do all this thing is a successful for fun but if you think that create income is not possible at and therefore we understand that entertainment has to be to the legitimate according to be watchedmovie on Netflix APK game aur Chilli good friends and all your break times at annual to solve it but if it becomes an identity is a very scary situation what happened to all the Tik Tok stars what are you doing now I'm curious because it became the identity for the good guys for the casualif the person is what makes money right getting followers and likes I do think that well right to solve a problem or se kya faydawrite an that to me is a very early stage right now very understanding missing the unit has been told that entrepreneurship exhausted their country of the Anderson and Businessman Virat country of like job makers but be forgotten what makes people pay money what makes people cannot do stuff that is going to be answering a question on start and containing Ipopulation register board and alone and lonely love times with friends and their converting the identities to different things but my biggest why is that if this becomes reality what happens to your reality that going to be a celebration it's one of those things we'd definitely gaming has advantages the gaming industry has potential to grow it will create some jobs but not jobs tosatisfy the whole bubble of youth that kind of invested in it and I think that people are so into the dopamine cake aspect of the game that they will go to any degree 2x to defend even the concept of gaming so the final take away is that it's cool have fun but grow skills that you are outside of it even if you grow gaming skills at just having the second third fourth fifth skills that can I had so much to me when you're giving career site of you look at it like that now one of thefinal few questions I have to the podcast again we spoke a lot more was driven societies in this and that seems to be a concern that you think about a lot that we like to think about Wealth a lot in general and not want money I'm just talking about wealth even means knowledge wealth means you know just the ability to invest in different places the ability to affect other people's lives ability to elevate your team all that is well keep that in mind what other next Industries USAwould invest in would keep an eye out for for this country / for the world what are you looking at specifically and I obviously have to ask you that do you have an eye on social media like that the selfish question but really want know all is created when you help people achieve what they want in life the moment you make it easy for themthey give you money for money is what we pay to somebody or a product to make it easy for us to achieve what we want the summary of a business on different things for example if you are a lot of Indian parents disproportionately spend on let's educating the kids but would they Pay 5 with extra delivery charge to getfastest because as a country we never had integration is not understood the value of time to go to any country because that first job was then come true in the head is 1 hour in Indiamonthly and introducing a monthly income and we do not a good time on hourly basis for example if you find out that the power is rupees does it make sense to spend 30 minutes to look for 200 rupees discount for flight ticket and this person does not just because you don't understand this concept and thereforein this country making money on products safe time sometimes order this product in three statistical the statistical society and fundamental of the prophets are entitled to the societal you want for example I have a friend who used to be a buyer at a very large retail company in India have to just one thing that can you please check the margins of product in the living room and productdining we have kitchen please check following and profit margins of living room bedroom in a large company why because living room bedroom is not and fundamental either for margins in India and more living room design bedroom productscontact and western countries individualistic they spend a lot more money in the bed sheets and lot more in the mattresses and beautiful pillows and the bathroom and separate take care of themselves and motivation statuswhat what would be examples of status driven businesses like that have this status game at the ko Chashma 78but is sold for next to a information for 5000 25000 60000 write any product that we signal that this award is this is Adidas logo it is so much more expensive because you can then I saw this and understand this designwhich is the status of Velacheryplease status for prevent status loss right so anything that could be high gross margin business to reduce the social status so you protect in some way so emotional I will always have highest margin other I remember watching this movie Ayushmann Khurrana and their parents Health Care delivery late age of aquatic animal moviethis guy goes to a wedding of a jija ji analysis and collecting money and on weddings but how many unicorns in India startups havebackground of weddings 030 is we are more ideas to copy from the world should you not learnt anything most ideal India Copycat models of the Western and Eastern model Where are spending on wedding is a very Indian educationeducation India Today liveand be surprised when you doing some work for them it more to save the time or was it more increases status sometimes ask this question will reveal more things what what Industries would you point young investors at a young entrepreneurs who just don't know what they can enter find big ideasmom-dad cousin Rashtrapati payment for it not look at the internet and intranet the answers are around you if you can't find a way to make a black platform lekin app distributor of that always ask this question to your family members volume during people will pay money for this would you pay money for thiswhat will your dad pay money for what value of Bombay for what will your cousins brother sister 14 if you know this 90% of time Milta the successful business because you are fundamentally ask the question is what I all knowledge sources how do you work your brain muscles like what would you recommend any books that created an impact in ebook to go back to what would you do for your mindI don't finish any book I read I am a guy who gets curious about a topic that I research everywhere is called God for example a curious about what shampoo brands that I found out that the gold shampoo come from the world champion and the guy who used to sell them for champi in India when to Europe and and European convert the product into shampoo ashitakashampoo and the word shampoo contain the world champion now point is because nobody has ever got curious about a shampoo and curious about many many topics I researched completely and I left my curiosity view while you why it is important topic in India if you are a kid and your enemy of us got something up and away itna dimagproperty but every killed as it take for me to use internet for asking this question how does this work why does this box how many people know your bank so how many will know how automobile companies work how many people not Tesla Ka Pata Kaise banta haihow many people Facebook has using the product everyday if you are not going to be randomly curious you will quickly become less income compared to most people last question of this podcast on a very brotherly level without your entrepreneur suit on just your in your boxes what is the best and worst aspects of your life as a gairight now best is yet to meet people smarter than be constantly by the right into the ice cream recipe right to them and and constantly try to spend time it was more than me and doing that you read the books you watch the videos are you meet them and 90% of your time spend with people was more than you will come smartand what you think I am tired with this whole thing of everybody will hold in and the spontaneous horse discussion wild and creativity is stuck because all of us have started this zoom word which is great other other than covid-19 talk about computer I hear you about covid-19 liferead so much time I wish I could not sleep and have just be constantly don't you restart order curiosity and constantly be amazed at things in English by things and a i i just I wish I was getting London life and 41 down and and it is hard to keep of I leave my street Annamalai you kya ho gaya write an article to change that what isVR Mall movie Army aur Mukesh Ambani Elon Musk anybody general everybody has 24 hours every day the difference is 42 the difference thank you Mr Kunal Shah here is the first episode of I am dead show a lot more

your biceps and triceps what is that when I worked in the information in the operating room my mind this guy gets it it just gets an arm and it's been really fascinating and amazing for me personally to watch real truth in this journeyvaishnoi on your purchase is it true honour which ok in your people is is also an amazing thank you so much for having neon thank you my brother welcome to the Ranveer show but I have to begin this podcast by tell you a story I don't know if you may not be able to see at Bihar me badh as a board that my study desk right behind me and I started out this journey in 2015 August anything you at about 700 cases back then and withinstarting out beerbiceps of random and send me your Channel V myself I am I being watched alot and very soon after that you hit 1 million remember your growth from 700 on mill was like very very fast and in that one that 1 million views super emotional but you also mention that you took seven years the head that mark enables you to Hustle show it inspired me but the other thing I did was I kind of used your blue print as a reference soErode 7 years on a piece of paper and until I hate 1 million there was a 7 years that that people with 7 is written on it was on my study table behind it it was hydrogen Alpha M syrup for 7 years is not fair that that's the advantage of being in India you know like having like so many people but man I cannot explain to you it's not just me there's a lot of grounded out there who have metyou have no idea how many people your voice is reaching out to us that feel man is something that you to Vinay so why women and realising that you have the ability to effectively people it was also must carry for me when I realised that an and I said this before but due to the audience is well in YouTube has made me be a better person and really the reason isand another very very upsetting to me when I see with people that I admire in anime with celebrities or people in a in empower text may be that I know you have this image of them and over certain ek do something that had like sharing your perspective on itself youtubers as made me realise that with this incredible incredibleGori Nach Nach on insert that I need to walk the walk in YouTube as as as resolved in a indirectly cause me to be and beneficial in its benefit what is called me to be a better person in Instagram in the underlying that you know what this is this is your opportunity I have affected people like to listen to me and I have to say is very visible white chairanimate amazing what is also carry on street exam in Army of fans believes in you completely man like I have this big mental in my life who has always told me that Ranbir you got and create a thousand other than B then as long as you do that you'll have achieve your goal and I just wanna tell you man like anything I'm doing to beerbiceps you have been a part of life the inspiration behind that soon a personal level you have to give me a lot of confidence both as a youtuber and just as a brother and ok for example like one quick example is that we both like on the shorter side way around the same height and I remember watching the video of you talking about how short guys should dress and carry themselves during you say that just kind of like this exclusion of confidence all the short guys over the worldthe characteristic of view your personal your person and involve pura phone definition in different ways in everybody has in securities and on and I personally believe when should you want to come and another level interfere with my ability to recover after my dreams my goals and be successful and I just I hope that that my my experience my being able to talk about a gaiit is amazing that helps in our schedules are there in self and the otherafter watching your channel I definitely learn how to dress Bada how to take better care of my grooming routine all that but the other big kind of ability I gained is the ability of confidence is going to talk to people and I believe that both when it comes to the women and when it comes to business that one ability that just makes you you know it puts you in another League so man I want to ask you only when you have a younger I know your your your Alpha I am now a symbol of international confidencethe day back back in the day did you ever let your height you know talk against you did you ever voice in your head that kind of chipped away at your confidence levels my brother things up with an abusive and insert query on age I was very aware that II don't know I need a trip to the defence mechanisms will that I should shut down and it enough you with my ability to stand up for myself and available from the age of 12 years old and I actually went in and sought help myself to you can slingshot at a 24-hour I didn't have the ability to the confidence to stand up for myself confrontation scare the academy and innovation award winningI should be impressed in making sure that I had chosen to grow with the supervisor is interfering with my ability and my wife and said that was a big issue on another thing that I've personally is feeling

read and I'm in I never really enjoyed reading because I want to the special score that how are you have a spell based on panic and it was you spell the word with sound as a Process that how they believe will be around in a spell in this was something that in a promise day whenchildren in canon first-rate I did not answer reading and spelling here is something that I struggle with grammar and punctuation I'm just not good at and that's another one of my taken securities was the fact I don't read very much I can read nai reading and similar records and antonyms of in 24 hours as a paper work in and I would actually I want I am interested in improving the fact in some people like to read some people than itsnic in name implies that end we are having securities that cineyug I do we are there everybody listening hasn't securities am in the funny thing about and securities is the difference invisible of the time right answer most people in only tell them I am insecure about this from insecure but I'd like to see this as a problem but it'sv or even worse production 7 below 10 years we see the 5000 actor body fat VC firm and skin but the real side effect and end in a security it's something I've struggled with my name in a visit us for people listening but I think we all have mine and I am still dealing with it today it's this fear of not making itbecause I want to make it in life man like I didn't really really want to become the Jack Ma Of India the Union of India and I think I'm on track with it but it's just one of those things that I'm tryna make peace with as I grew up unfortunately the your fall into the Trap that I think about and monetary dance at sister's of media is that in that we compare the everybody you are so for a headwhen I was here we have so many people who have taken it to the next level in your driver motivation is such an inspiration for me but I'm sure everybody what is you and consumes you can't and meet you in your inspiring and the better you have the ability and have the ability to change the many wives in a there is there is your 6s more more than most people ever but during the lifetime of ready and serve other number 200understand that I never want to study in on the same same way and it is it scary the think about not achieving your destiny or if your people believe that means a lot man that's why you are Alpha M but if I had to ask you the origin story of the superhero image Dube built out what would it be men what like where did your regions happen in the gymuse of my mum gave me a Fitness membership to eat

that on it of the week and figure out at work for strength and toughness and Pammi growing up poor into bankruptcy having businesses in a visit my best friend by all of these things were worked as a person and Critical to the me as in Hindicalling my my talking is my strength and and automatically getting comfortable in my own skin so I am so I think the growing up is an advantage for those people that locate the situation as the defining characteristic of who they are but just use that as a whole and does masturbation affect themselves up and make something of himself and I think that there are critical for developmentbeautiful and what what you up to right now in life like others in the YouTube channel what do you do I am anios.ac business package 2013 county in Pedro and then

with so much content like your job as a blueprint for a hardworking YouTube how do you come up withnow you know it it it it can I thinking outside the box with a beautiful thing you've been doing a long time I we have enough things change in said the ji the video that I did 6 to 7 years ago about Denim and jeans that information is different and sell it is the inner as we as individuals and reaches the value of a prospective develop in suffering new contentall subjects of service something that IPL is is is critical in service is always something to talk about in my opinion they are sometimes it's easier than others but but just now just thinking about it in and I love it create a process and figuring out if an angle to in a Promoter in advertised on the reasons why I am able to continue to do what I was much content is because I have a lot of advertising that I do on hisonly IAS answer when you can pray and that has a father can I say this is the product it forces me to be creative and think of the from where is the integrated into the topic Karan talking about advertising is actually been one of the reasons why I will enable the content to generate is much creative printers and decided I know I know your someone who super humble as a guy that probably because of your upbringing and you know what are you went to in your past so I know for a factnot the kind of person who takes the success for granted and my question to you is man of the youtuber life can be intense spoken a lot of youtubers from all over the world lot of people dealing with mental health issues with confidence issues everyone thinks that you know what problem tomorrow all this might collapse and then I don't know what I'm going to do so when was the last time you had a face like that yesterdaywhat is the just now it nnn its effect on green arrow is a n n it's it's it's a barrel with yourself with the barrel with your brain just stay level and energy and user bad in our living with them in the day with everything and and and its effectMI YouTube use it affected my by businesses in terms of self and wellview our control feeling I don't have control over my head around this situation just just really trying me and I am a woman and I can't provide I Breathe deeply and and there's nothing I can do to change this what I can do is focused on myself and work and be disciplined and that helps make a hard time getting back to work on a person have my question to you was goodOppo yourself outward you answer it pretty much I once had one of his anxiety attacks recently about a month ago I was with another mentor of mine and he told I told him that you know what I want this to be my MVP season had one bad your so I was trying to set up my own Media company for the last two years and I felt like this last one year was my last your want to be hands on with it and now I want to I want to start focusing on my YouTube game again from this year onwards and I told you that I am angry with youShiva Shiva Bheem Aayo he told me that it's great to have hopes and ambitions like that but no MVP decides that this season's Gonna Be My MBP season and MBP only preposition self to play violin one game so you take one their time to take one game time and I think at the end of the day you are a trust yourself with the fact that you brought it from point a to point Z2 you definitely be able to take it further and I also just one ad here that men andyou get out in a mall in Delhi or Mumbai to Bangalore you will be mocked that your level of Fame in this country I can tell you perfectI mean it is amazing support and love that I receive and sell it up knowing that I need to come over 10% when you're starting out did you think that you be talking this part of the world as well like that you have that vision in YouTube was the support for anybody who is mymorning star of the place of word video understand what is subscribe reverse and and really got me on the sky was on a purse video I am a big bi I don't know what the weather in how to the second video next impermeable what to wear on your head and with that moment that I will provide no idea what you do was all about when I started to know I neverhan han it's been 12 years since you are doing this so why do you think youtubersgonewild 2032 when what do you think you'll be doing 12 years from now I don't have any ideaschange in the past two years drastically I think I'd definitely worth the while making videos I don't know what frequency and over-the-counter and around but I am company that in 10 years developing am I will I was to be healthy and after to do this and so have a passion to help people and enjoy the coffee making YouTube videos in terms of what the platform was like I have no idea do you believe in God and and livewhat's the origin story of that like as it is a childhood thing because I didn't believe in god my childhood and something that can you came in my life and l letter because I spirituality means it is different than what it means to keep on terms of organised religion I did not have this one specific provision my my family is Italian has worked in serve in a growing up everyIs Bhari Bhari insert in a Governor Governor in everything is my mother on the other hand she was more like a happy a free spirit and she didn't want me to be walked into the ideologies of unorganised drug agency want to meet all of the stopper things on my own and my father's attribute from the age of 12 history practice in BuddhismI have seen and then I saw it was so I saw it researching the foregoing provisions just for my personal in a interest I I was interested to see in a world where all is the provisions in a review on the same things using different names for things and I was interested in admin server in 80g and and I can allergies or something that I am very interested inIPL every in a personal connection with the with my God and and I think that is up big for my wife in something that I I believe and what it means to I think it is sitting on a big chair repair in a I don't but in a I do believe have you had experience is in your life where you are your strength and God has like increased after having a certain experiencenot really and the reason I say that is because every time I will going to do something really bad in a bike with another is my business buying I would pray God please please please please please please please please and when it didn't work out with the I thought it should I get upset and some when you see peoplemy wife's brother was 2844 in a mysterious things they got it was a kaarvayi with this happen but I think that is a much more likes youretrospect in army in perspective that you are able to realise that the best thing I will happen if there is something out and higher power that is stored of directing and hoping and instead of guiding you on this journey that his wife he she whatever you your reception out of it is definitely had a plan in place and and gave me what I needed now what I wanthow to make sense around 100% you do now look back at those moments and say that this is what got the standard tell me ok this is work in thatfor that reason the forest Habitat saying is an attorney if I invite you to experience Like The Spiritual aspects of this country men like at some point in your life definitely make a trip to the Himalayas and its not from letter A religious perspective of you know it's nothing it's nothing ritualistic but I feel a lot of people go deeper into themDavid Beckham super self aware when they spend time in certain parts of this country and that the big in nature and environmentI want to talk in a music Taki manager is another George Harrison from the hero who came in and Jerry come in the India track all the Beatles came to India domestic bliss Rishikesh but he was the one who really like embraced it to the next level and and innovative yoga and meditation in oven service when I am unfamiliar and understand that is something that they wantin the future I think it will happen to you and hopefully will do that trip together but I would love to be changed completely and ask you about the best and worst aspect of your experience when you did that whole thing had given on it twice encapsulatingincidence was the best and worst aspects of it the best aspect the short experience was just the process of a being out there in California and forming the we have to search because we make YouTube videos as the first time I really so why you production and behind-the-scenes and said I was like my super bowl and in the best for going outwhat is the meaning of the age of the earth because one of the aspects the starting the ID of this is that they might help of the season with and Michael one week period and audience to know the user the north and it is one hotel and so you get at like everybody at this hotel was not going on short time insert the first time I was on the rise in the news has worked so many people were an interesting ever to be around that many inWindows was nothing ever experience before I think one of the unfortunate reality is a bi not know is that it is a journey of Indians in Kirana business partners if you don't have enough people on the team's First Avenger sorting out its its over then insert not having the ability or people actually Tamizha request what is share the highest knowledge and torque in your friends were not provided they don't understand why you're giving water why you're going to exactDeccan bole to take it necessary to understand answer going out and just being immersed in a CM Entrepreneurship and creativity that was the best part 2 words for about ok thank thank u i think it's the town was at the first time zoneI didn't get the all the first time that I will show you how you can be yourself in a mic at work with the offensive system and a minute in happen and the person I did air rifle born power system after the anticipation abimbola per month on month to month that is very hard emotional my I think I get the first few daysthought for me and over work experience is amazing I love I love but I'm really this is something I wanted to ask you for a while problem since I began watching your channel what you working towards what's your end goal that something I am sure enough it and I don't knowyou know I think I've got a friend go to my businesses YouTube I don't have a girl is this like in our once I reached this this point in terms of subscribers months I reached this is not really that like that that they were thinking about what I reached this then my cats that should have been ongoing thing but this is it your goal for my goals are in a newly you know I want you know I want to be better than I didcoronavirus new people and end in carrying out from benchmark in self propelled know I have an opinion poll closed but in terms of what I want I just want to be happy and I know that stand out but it's not provide I was wondering and I hope that I can continue to do this is long time ago and I think that the direction will will show itself to me when when Humsafarand right now I just in focus on on achieving small increment of girl with teacher my my business is more baby steps and you know I don't I don't have to be even more stuff I don't have that I just want to be viewed as a successful synonym of your personally for self and I can a company that I would continue to come and take itso here is how I look at you I think people already view as a successful entrepreneur financially I mean people view as like this master entrepreneur but most of all I think it's the impact your creating all over the world is not just in your country like I think that's something a bit again this comes from your humility that you are not able to digest that but you have no idea about the kind of confidence you are spreading all over the world so I think you achieving your goals everyday andHubli someone who just wants to reactivate every single day and keep it going just like a true entrepreneur and helps me and niana c30 isliye Roman Harry Potter quizzes of happiness and success Insignia making a difference by that helps me and fuels made in the reason why in a I am as well as I am is because I do have the ability to get feedback from people and Android devices I get emails that I am making a difference in summerTumi Amar any better purpose is to help people and am and serve it isn't enough to make a living doing that is well is just because you are an entrepreneur and dead show your very self-aware what's your biggest strength and weakness in life professional is speaking speaking Am I by no my weakness I know I've got our weaknessesmy my biggest weakness is is myself in terms of getting out my own way I hold myself back because I am resistance to change I am a creature of habit I like routine I like to be se and one or the other thing that is also a unintended consequence of my upbringing in a drawing drawing of an abusive in a family situations I want to stay in myone happy Bam safe here if I cannot say if I understand and I can control my current environment would stay here but unfortunately as you know you can grow without taking risks in getting on comparable and for sale for me it's hurting myself and being aware that I need to push myself in order to get out of this this comparison the time in and my best Seasons pineapple doesn't have been the one that I was scared is the maid hiring peopletaking risk taking chances of the most beneficial but I was the scariest for me and I am not good at being uncomfortable and that's probably one of my biggest weakness is your weakness I have is I am a control freak I even though I understand I am not good at everything is giving up power and control is not easy does it come easy at home easyyears as I've seen that I can get this offer my weight if I can give something that not Raider Raider of doing this person taken with the developed during a I can do this what I was doing with straight horns and instead of being higher level then then then then Break It Moves the Nirahua raises the ocean romain insert into another another aspect but in terms of strength in my strength is my body to work really hard and even when things don'tsexy Earth filing due think that's the one thing you've done right on the whole Alpha M entrepreneurship journey I am not scared because I have the worst thing that happens if I try this if I want to try this and it would be drivingform in SBI bank of the care about it and not to buy and sell my willingness to take changes in rest I don't just one in the things planned in a I have warned over the years that had in years and had some success but as a result of the collective it allowed me to should be willing to for myself with the period of a failure to success call Manu happened happened it's okand if you truly successful it can happen what honestly I think you doing orations different things in serve to us just do not take it personally I'm scared to feel that another one of my friends so I can change your but in that same mode because you so bankruptcy kind of alien life I am sure that affected yourpoint on money so what do you do with your money right now in the same or not asking everybody know the entrepreneur I'm asking Aaron Marino the brother like how do you take care of your money specifically where you invested how do you ensure that it good to keep multiplying so I don't have any that another something where bankruptcy in our study my Image consulting business that was a will it help me it was a vis a vis a viscreativity and my my passion for life being in that ending right but how is my built-in and insert it were the ones that happen if we never had that again and so I have is all my business is also funded never raised any money never taken any that that's one thing I am I also paper things in cash by them also I don't have I don't know itbecause it because that cares me in a situation I said the citywhy does message am I in Anderson in nature on iOS in my family and I am rose day I iron in a state and a few units of the business is important to be a mean of the business community coronavirus affected people I am not strong enough when along with my percentage of a backstory of the business in iOSjobs in companies that that I believe in that I think I'm gonna do do good things and I didn't want to be a part of the story and and allows me to do what I do which is have a good morning I can contribute and offer some advice I can in and around as money there is well known so that I know that my money and interest money in in in summer the market that answer scariest thingour bread and buttertowards the poem what are you doing and I think we protect our things for Grand we never experience to hardship I never have enough over the course of history by am I think that we are a nation in Thailand with an hour for people on thyroid The Tiger including succession comfort when in AVR Bhari insulated from the reality that is whyensure it like that is probably one of the downside to after being an American is that IT soft in regard to BMC in war in AVR machine draught on head like like like protected and this is one of the active 911 there was one of the first time that I think it really brought us as Americans and made it provides more Meri vanaraseyou are in this situation ever having right now I think this also was another game changer for us because we never experience that I think that this is good I think I think that if there is a silver lining in a coronavirus is one of them is that I think is forcing us to open up a bit and and and and and prospective seekingthe best part in a without an amazing country that is the land of opportunity you can I dare you can a connection and you got the willingness to work hard you can you can be a success and serve in anything is possible but can you give break down the land of opportunity thing a little more like what does it mean being because I usually people say that I am show living in America you get a different kind of perspective on that whole statementit's hard to store it in perspective when you grow up here I am I think that is one of the reasons why in a I think that people emigrants to this country have a much deeper respect and appreciation for this country and for the opportunities that presents of here in a pear Noni dafa you know that ok if you work hard you you know if you have a vector mindand you said you think that you can accomplish in a whatever you want in Healthcare is this country want you to be comfortable and and or government set things up for that honestly I will take care of people to some degree but it's an opportunity that this country is a land of opportunity there is there is inscribed resources there is Great Wall and like I said if you can I then you get the following is the role of you sleepingin figure things are you can and future not used my perspective as an outsider is that the big challenge we deal with in India and just generally Asia is that it's very kind of price point sensitive so any product or putting out your the cheapest product ones that that's that's the ground rule so you have basically a huge number of products created to bring down your cost price and that's that's aqeedah business you but I feel within America people alot more open the spending money people respect the quality of products way more that probably my reading of Land of opportunity but my question to you we spoke a Lil bit about the coronavirus situation what a people in USA thinking about the whole situation was like everyone's attitude on every time I know that different people everywhere and all that for an average water people thinking everybody isbecause this is not something we experience every the right now of this magnitude is not an in my wife timer my my Paris flight time everybody is very concerned I think get worse when in a week here we heard about is coronavirus thing is something out with something every time I was in effect for these other auxiliary diseases actressesthought that that was and he was over there not here once again in America and and and and andeverybody is going to their bye have me that produceRitesh environment and leave a lasting impression in the water can I think that won the silver lining that is this for a process known as a country here is that things will be there for me and I think that the things to be taken for brain in Sweden now we are in the longer the more lasting and the deeper the impact is going to be moving forward as an entrepreneurwhat's your big business opportunity that you supported for the time period post coronavirus you looking at things that way because I mean that's just the nature of being an entrepreneur like you kind of think of how your consumers will behave what will happen to the world and they say the biggest business is a built in and around massive waves that hit the world so I strongly believe that this is whole thing called stay home economy basically peoplesrequirements at home you go around your own house in figure ok this is not lacking your this is was lacking you are the businesses which tap into those vacuums businesses that se Ok your attitude can product for that with primary is at home situations that businesses that they gonna take off but what your kind of opportunity that you are seen as an order no no I see that is as accurate I think that there is thissome Kota a people and that there was right there have you had your breakfast you explain it to the audiences as per is somebody who is preparing over is preparing poor Ayyappa Collateral worst case scenario not have to order for the economy the completely shut down and his people prepare and for youusing sort rows of water resources they live and opportunity and this is the first time that happiness all these preparation people that were prepared and other companies that actually Hero to that that that mindset in so youfree package NIOS yoga in the map you gotta put ration system I think that this is going to force a lot of people to start to develop our abe abe abe I am and entropy prepare for something like that I think that they don't come as resolved that have to this is there is an increase in any business that is in that space is not doing well I think home is going to be another big thing becausethis time one of the first things that start with candles and helpfull and had taken away from you what you do that too much homework top you can do with 2 chairs and underground milk in a enjoying Kerala people to this will talk to develop maybe by the way a more structured in a basic equipment and dumbbells in natureit's funny because there is a place around me the requirement in my body 102 time by something unable sold out it's all aboutfriend right thank you don't start to become more popular is men makeup aira gaira Te anau white eyeshadow in safalta per like in a most riser in your parents like acne I see that as the next week Android on men's Google mean trend that is really very popular countries and I think I am I think that is going to be something that is going to be a friendwhy do you say that this thing is going to start popping after the coronavirus situation was specifically the strength because I see what's happening I think this happened n and I think that more people can come to go with the fact that I'm an implication is now at eyeshadow in which state but it's just grooming products that are designed to help even skin tone in just give you the components am I think that for long timemakeup husband Tabu for men and when you hear about men's makeup you think you know bro mando where that and I think that one of the beautiful things about the time in which we live with that it's more about in a way that means that you want to activate Ho proper pimple on the dark circles under your eyes I think this is allowing us to be more free and I think that is going to be a trend that is going to to increase incoming at the time I I believe that can be happier than just buy mens grooming products right men's skin care is not a big thing 10 years ago it was not use men's makeup is going to be one of them is there is next Haat market do you do you think that the fashion in growing industry in general is good to take some kind of a hit because of the coronavirus situation because maybe people have a head out less or you knowgreat books in India like I believe that something like the Deodorant industry of the perfume industry they might take a hit your Cruise wise in India usually only put on perfume when the going out on a date if they want a girl to smell them for you know it's like that all men all over the world to us apparel has taken a big head from the coronavirus because you are not going you are the reason the bearissues because you don't have anywhere to wear them anymorevibhajya operation incentives in nature with soap or not on board the grooming space is reasonably strong itself on a regular basis I mean I know you don't have five year plans but in your head you a roadmap

you on the Ranveer show grading near to so I know we're going to record numerous for class in the future but today is the episode when I want to introduce you to my audience is common friend Manish Pandey is been on the podcast himself for our fantastic episode 11 most loved episodeone is just about your story now here's coating Manish Pandey he said that one of the most unique unique among people all over the world and long story short you're gone from being in the army serving in the army you served in Congo Angola and you then you transition to working with the government then you translationcorporate Karegi back to the Reliance and now your kind of I would like to call you Reliance freelance motivations Fredo leadership coach sleeve I want to know about your story right from college and then as you go for the so youngest of you wanna know some more thing about you is Manish is extraordinarily kind with his word and that he alsoone of the smartest and most accomplished people he's worked and that's coming from him and drinking something something so it's not a very extraordinary story it's not something I planned out of something like just happened I I grew up in Delhi and my parents are from South India I was born and brought up in Delhi and network my name is Raghu Ramanstill and done but being in Delhi my accent impressionistic nivada Jaat when I joined my battalion that the Raghuraman became Raman and Raman Raman ever since I was in the army to get Re Christian than that happened to me so I was in Delhi I was in college study my degree in Delhi university in South Campus and I had no intention of these were in my family up down left right socertain circumstances which happened I don't think any of your business will be old enough to remember 1984 when the right happened in Delhi and that connects with me completely when I saw the Carnage that after the first time I think when you see it is the delay secrets for pretty bad and I was actually those living in a place called Mayur Vihar which was next to another area called lokpriya Trilokpuri was the worst hit during partition Delhi so much so that it was mentioned by name in BBCthis is a river and then after that three days of mayhem whatever I only saw the army come in the moment army game it was like you know the storm ending and everything and everyone became like and for ay 2018 19 20 year old boy that was like this is the organisation I want to join and I I joined the army and costs again I joined it was very different places which uses this was in 1986 so 1984 and is what this happens 1980is a process of applying and 1986 when I joined the Academy soap about 18 months training in the academy and after that 1987 I gotta gotta stop you there for the training in the Academy is it doesn't mean it's intense you are your training a bunch of leaders will have to take the troops into active combat it's not the art of living it is the act of killing so it has to be extraintense it you you will be the whole training of armed forces leaders at any level is basically to train them to operate under conditions of high stress and stress where you are likely to lose your life that can be nothing more stressful than that are not doing your job not losing your loved one losing your own life so that any has to be written to the extent and there are certain principles of the training pedagogy which we probably didn't understand that one definelooking back some years later and it's ironical that not applicable very normal that I told send a my career as an instructor back in the Academy is where I was a student and now when I saw it through the eyes of the instructor has a pedagogy I understood what was the national of each one of those elements like the given example result date like this and they also Life lesson on looking at training and Life lesson on storytelling by the so NDA Academy every day you have physicsBanaras Banaras Mein Bima Anar and you have drill drill is using 12 march past and all that stuff so this drill is you are like drilled again and again every punishment is a former Federal so then when you are punished it is again drill you do that and at that time we use to wonder why the hell are we waiting so much of time because it improves the military bearing and all that stuff from the way you stand in the way you are Transporter amiga usually just by looking at them and that's ok but whyyou waste 1 hour for 18 months everyday now interesting to see if you look at it the national behind that the national behind that is you are creating a body of troops who will work synchronised under one command know the synchronisation goes to such a level that when this body of troops is spread over the parade ground can provide you have over 500 offices lined up in the parade ground and now in the guard commander South diningright turn when is South Dynamo the person who standing in the extreme right he has two turns to slightly slower because the time it takes for the sound to reach the last person has to compensate for it so if you didn't know that when you see them turning right you see a wave that you don't see that whenever you see a drill happening specially in Academy is like the Indian Military Academy of the NDA where does not approve the office as being print the highest level or officers training academy you find themin one marks like and that's when a drill instructors who tell tell us that in 18 months time we will put you into a unit that moves at the speed of sound not that's when you understand the intensity of the pedagogue you why they are doing that doing it because they want to force the unit which is got the margin of error of the speed of sound right so of course the rate of training and on what basis are people rejected from entry into the training process that there is an entrance exam3 stage process not just the ones that the first is a common entrance exam which is the you can apply through NDA wishes after your schooling how are you can apply after graduation that will direct entry and then there are other countries like the engineers have already done their engineering they can go in the technical and trees and their doctors and other there be different processes the first stage is a common entrance test which you have to appear objective type exam I believe it's much better for now than it used to bebadhiya grilled on what are the Common Aptitude Tavera the aptitude test is it sits just objective testing testing you for basics Applied Mathematics understanding is that the like any other it is actually filtration process the second stage is the Services Selection Board interview that the three-day process contains three some time is more than three in which you are tested for what they are looking for is that but was termed as officer like qualities or in other words leadership qualities and leadership quality doesn'trunning faster than the others or jumping higher than the others it means are you able to take a team of people who may be better than you in many ways and get them to work together can you show the force that is this that capability is there is it if people skills its leadership skills it is leadership skills and also as a psychometric testing is a very intense psychometric testing its ironical that you and I think the police doesn't have psychometric testing during induction badhiya metre so they actually psychometric test people to make sure that they aren'tsomebody who can you know on the next exam correct me if I'm wrong they had someone telling me that in the psychometric testing the tests like they will give you one word like knife in a blood and they form a sentence in 3 seconds that correct very commonly available and tested instruments show the ideas of this example in Telugu very very simply oversimplify NIT ideasnegative thoughts or positive thoughts with give your knife are you thinking about killing somebody or cutting the Rope 2 sem somebody coronavirus that's the way of looking at other course I know that a lot of applicants and all they have been coached by various people to innocent of artificial give positive it doesn't work the testing team is very very experience and they can figure out if you are planning to take it so but interesting and this interesting part that I want to tell everyone who is listening Aspiring to itthe way the process happens with dressing at its finest lessons in HR that you can genuinely think it's I've never seen that example in any copper what happens is after the two or three days of your SSB Service Selection Board all of the credits to that point of time but all of the applicant's they are taken into the main hall at the end of every other selected not selected you don't know at this point of time and then the board presidentstart reading out the names of the people who have been rejected and not rejected in this batch carried out a name like se and just making up the Abdul Kalam applied and change it got rejected Kapil Dev appliances on the place got rejected so so gotta Heena rates that if you get rejected over here there is a better future waiting feel like I haven't seen an HR process where you take care of the sensitivity of the person who is not made and then they also say thatdoesn't option other than the batch area who made in the seat and they make you feel not the end of the world may be something and then they announce the names of the people who actually cared so the SSB is a very intense process and to my mind you really can not fake that process YouTube you either have it in you are you don't have enough I don't have it in you I often tell people apply once it got to get in fantastic if not do it once more time because thenot have you may not have been your best water and then do it one more time with three times if it doesn't because it is a people were done it to the 833 some people do it on the level that and starting from India going all the way up to it but I believe that that process very accurately identify as I will give or take but broadly identifies the leadership qualities which are required to operate in in that contain but that doesn't mean the people who have been rejected from therecannot be exceptionally great leaders in other areas they will be they can be there usually are but the point is that what the forces are looking for is very different from maybe some of the Other elements and some element like I'll give an example a leader in any others dear banking real estate need not have other the criticality of physical courage is not that criticability of a leader to put himself in danger is physical change let's say I am working in an organisation as a head of security and let's in the organisation that is a major strike somewhere or there is a situation that can go volatile write it is the leaders physical courage of being present there are they don't worry I think you will be fine which comes things down so that all great leaders in INRinnocent even nonviolent leaders need to have a lot of physical courage Gandhi also the ability to take lucky of Talathi requires a lot of physical or putting your body in danger and that is trade which is extremely important in Combat Mission can't have a female GS of a leader who can plant strategy but unless it can lead the troops to phone following the translate in the many other forms of leadership physical courage is not the physical courage in terms ofBullet physical courage is also the endurance up to how many days we can say is a great example would be a prisoners of War would win in a subject to interrogation and they don't lose their spirit that is physical courage and effect when I did my Commando course years ago I still the number the chief Inspector telling us this that when the course and its 35 days of 35 days and 35 nights of pure hell when the course and then we were all sitting in that like for the final dispersalI remember the chief instructor saying that you will never ever be in your life more physically fit than you are today weather Su 35 days of the intensity of your training before the Commando course will come to the Commandos intense training in happens in Belgaum what what happens in the coast extended due to what happens in the course of basically you realise very quickly that any such course there are many Sachin Amoeba is the Commandos in Belgaum there is a course that happens in warranty in AssamRasiya JW counterinsurgency Jungle Warfare there's another one called horse high altitude Warfare school is a very very physically challenging and intense courses but I think the aim of this course as the chief instructor pointed out was not the physical fitness because he says this she says that on this day of your life you could be the petitioner life after the your own it is truly nobody can exercise for 18 hours a day and that's all you do in the Commando physical like subject that's not the point of this course the point of this causes any time in your lifewhen you are going through MS Dhoni going to the challenge of brick captured by the enemy spotted you must remember that you survive the Commando close enough to survive the Commando course you will survive anything so it is a course on mental training it's on mental the ability to take shoes amounts of mental stress and still be able to function to Vodafone 5060 70% of your normal operation so the training is much more focused on introducing Shauk introducing Kiyaintroducing trauma introducing exhaustion and still getting your mind to solve problems and just recently what is often required in combat situations so that is the training and of course there's a lot of Economics happened so let me clear a myth that I was told by my teachers in school rejoin the emitter ko fry karne ki let me clear that matter of fact and many friends in the Yeshu very often pull my leg by telling me we do 1 exam in a year and after that we never write in exam inUrdu 1 exam to enter and after that you will be studying hell of a lot which is good I think it's very good thing he does need to be knowledgeable and also there is a lot of emphasis on technology on leadership skills and training your India me your other preparing for battle of your training there is a fighting your preparing for fighting so training is an essential part of that and that carries through in your entire set of carrier you are various different intervention point so you will complete life exampleundertaking the army to remove from the same is true for airforce and Navy you will join the Indian Military Academy yourself Training School about setting Academy and after that basic course we are you doing train across all spectrum Zombie Army dual be given a particular arm is called the choice of you choose and also most people don't know but the army is insisting on many different units are there infantry the armored core the signals the engineers so many other course in different different lines ofso based aptitude based on your liking this is a process of selection whereby you are assigned the particular Nawanshahr signed into that then you are sent for specialised training in to that particular discipline that same mechanism country as I was so I'll have to undergo all the courses of an infantry officer which happens in Mau and all the courses of a mechanised infantry officer which happens in another so this is the basic course with this ok now it's a bit like the way you are now you are you studying the film Institutenow you want to become a cinematographer so for cinematography you'll have a very very specialised courses which deals only with cameras and they were it involved and then you will go for an advanced course in the same subject where you will be taught how to become an instructor in the army everything is taught by the same people who teach the next generation I will go back to the same Institute Where are used to be a student as an instructor if I am of course worthy of being an instructor so this trainingnews about the carrier is a great place to be if you like learning but there's somebody out there thinking that appears on the walls and I don't have to study I have installed but that bubble right now in USA after the training I mention I joined the Magnus infantry and my first stint was in Sangrur Summit I got a dilute 10 question with the Commando train liquid you just described the most intense day in atmosphere detail as possible everyday is intensedrills or whatever it is that they take you to another level of physical fitness they train you on how to operate in small teams that train you have to pick up skills which the trainee how to work with any kind of the improvisation and the environment how you can literally like diagram is like the Batman versus Wild Man versus Wild but actuallyaur to do with not the survival skills but also the ability to kill skills so it's not just what survival in the droplets into enemy territory it's not for you to survive and come back you also have to create an operation thereof to do something that so its physical fitness weapons training your train on different kind of weapons weapons that you may find with the enemy and other ton of stuff then you are trained and demolition explosions escape and evasion is a major part of the excise hunting is big size where you are takenfrom the Academy by choppers and all that and you are put into enemy territory and then from there you have to find your way back actually needed with simulated service centre Belgaum to your taken it was a simulation because they do is that take you away and then they release UN Badi pair that another very good learning that happens in the Commando course of action in the army so every this no individual reservation for the task or rightminimum pairs of Badi per phoolpur watch out for Each Other which by the way is one of the main reasons why mental health and stretches also under control or at least better handle the forces to call you always have one buddy that one Badi you can confess anything to get Badhai knows you inside out in your family knows you have a fight with wife in everything about you in this Badi per your released one by one and this Badi player has to find their way back there to navigate the can't use the road is done in the nightyah to rely on and there are several battalions of troops were deployed in that area whose mission is to catch you if an activity for them because they can still get two bottles of numbers and letters at about it is time to kill you but I have to tell you is almost it is very dramatic because if your court did take you back to the starting point So imagine you done by 40 kilometres of the 60 In The Catcher in the 40th kilometreyou don't get caught but that is the fear that you have in your head so escape innovation is a part of the exercise then you are taught many other skills in terms of their ability to read maps without compass how to navigate without compass how to move silently how to kill silently all those things are taught him that cause I have to ask vellarada question when is like what is the mental training a given about death and killing like is any kind of talk that someone has this question to answerI think that is the profession where you are going to see a lot of them right and a lot of trauma that no doubt and and and police also very pleased I think simo dead body is per se but but it's you can put your own troops into danger so and at times you will cannot be involved in operations was someone else will die sonow there's a lot more focus on mental stress the concept of posttraumatic stress disorder all of these things are now becoming much more understood I think when we were young officers I don't think we had even the construct of Innocence you came back from an operation and you like to know in in letters which happens in the first before you before you start getting more experience it was much more of all command is it happens when you that it was much more of findingMBM thus was part of the job and you slowly became accustomed to it right but now I think there is a lot more emphasis in terms of understanding what that does to a mind of a person and and and by the way these are also the things that are being tested out in your psychometric testing lab do you have the ability of will you know suddenly good pieces or whatever is not foolproof because money exchange as the WALL but it still good filter injoy thinkArya equation to the text entries from my training and now I think it's much more and I don't just Indian army army is all over the world are becoming farmer empathetic fascinatingly there is a see if I can send you that link of the promo link for the British army with the inviting the youth of Britain to join the army and basically talks about the fact that if you join the army you'll always have someone you can talk to set your feelings Drake feeling depressed am is the place to be because here we listen to youabout WhatsApp in your personal it's important to us so they actually advertising the fact that it is an empathetic organisation where you can build relationships with people who truly will be your inner blood friends friends for life and I think that's a very good step in acknowledging that listen these are not automatically not robots these are human beings and Furious human being to do something which is against the nature of what they've been taught culturally and all that they will be trauma and this from my needs to beand so I think now it's much better than what it used to be earlier that allows me to bring you back to the sorry but one of the peace which I think is remarkable thing is very important for us to recognise and Technology is that the training in the army also creates lifelong friends because I've always believed that you want to forget team into a theme for the group of people into it and just put them through the drama is true because if I ask you where were you when a 26/11 happenedYun remember exactly where you are you remember we were sitting right was when you first saw it on TV in what happened passed away last Thursday you like to check your smartphone because nothing happened last but an incident which happened 12 years ago is H your mind because it was traumatic you remember the the teachers in college were like traumatic teachers you remember traumatic experience that doesn't need to be bad it just needs to be a spike or undipova reading that part of the training where you become friendsmore than 200 300 officers and more than that actually Viva cosmetics and there is a right to have on the coast and I can tell you this happen to me recently had gone to meet coursemate of mine weather friend in in a place called Nahin which of the Commando training Commando training centre services from the special forces and is the US the chief Inspector them and my friend was with me was shocked to learnthat this officer and me after leaving the Academy vomiting after 20 25 years because the Brotherhood was such as if he were meeting everyday now that to my mind is wealth that is created and practical examples I I am the local Guardian to at least half a dozen Army bratz was studying here in Bombay because they have a right over my house because their father and me because mixandar uncle actually and support with the local Guardian only two for the excuse that they are staying at my place when there are doing something else it becomes like a family and that bond is so valuable especially as you grow older in order that the real wealth to believe wealth is what you have get what left after all your money is good after all your money is gone whatever you've got left that is wealth Goodwill your friends your ability toPune Race maybe your 50 lakh CPR to raise it just on people who trust you have faith in you that is real well this money is everything what is happening in covid-19 companies like we were wiped out overnight so that is really not well wealth is that and that gives you a very intense value of that will ensure is there in other professions also but nothing like what is there in the unforeseen because of the nature of that it also what I would like to call enhance the experience of life as and legs as liferegular 95e accumulating money and that is your definition of wealth but putting yourself through this way of developing lifelong bonds or developing this kind of mental training to those intense experiences that enhances your whole viewpoint on life you live you live your life so when I use this example very often that if you take your life right now Akon 7 years old take your life unconscious life conscious life will be remembering war 2007 rate list 1 20 years if I took your life of 20 years as a questionthe listeners can actually just do the mental exercise and say ok fine if your entire life was shot in a film in the world cellulite film and we strongly typed in this all like that and then I took a pair of scissors and started cutting bits and pieces out of it and stuck it back together you know what is the difference in the last Wednesday was exactly like this Wednesday in the same routine your doing you know the difference if you don't know what is the difference you might have not lived as yours write a t s enterprises in you don't to the new themessage se 12 Sal remaining eight years ago new not so I think the experience of the highs and lows with the travel that involve different parts of the country that you see different and individuals that you see different kind of cultures you meet that to my mind is like this my travel is an important form of education because you are actually interfacing with other humans were completely different from you not not in the Dekho Chamber of the same group of people whom you say my dearYacht I think that is another very very strong point of the armed forces the area it just gives you a completely and of course level cosmetics and a possible that their exposure is also in other countries over the country is interface with them and all that which we also get but much there because they are exposed the usually in UN mission for when we go for some International courses but I think it's an incredible way to live life really did you and I have to ask this because I am the masalabut what your life intense memories about going into battle so comment I do want to make it sound as if I believe in law offices of my friends also believe that the only true heroes we call them are dead people those who have lived through any combat experience you cannot call them what they were then and now that I've done anything but whatever they are done is not nothing compared to the peepbattery died so I think that the real heroes can only be those who can a person survive from very dramatic I think the most intense experience is not so much about soybean in a few situations where once the situation begins you are like in a days it's your just operating with muscle memory and all of that in a days I think the fear is before that the operational before thatanything in my case I can tell you and I am sure many other people can have spoken to them it's not so much the fear of what can happen to me I lose my leg and I know that I think that is a fear of course but the biggest fear is that will I be able to will I be able to do it will I be able to hold the responsibility given to me will have the courage that point of time is a strong sense of Brotherhood also there is a very intense of Brotherhood and that is whyleading them you cannot be you cannot fault and your confidence in yourself that kar Paunga main will I be able to do it when the bullet start flying what really happened so that blooding of course after 2-3 skirmishes it is it by public speaking and I'm using a variable example was a little bit like public speaking that the first time and you doing it if you are you are scared of what I might do wrong you my 200ntorq still have a light aprahan which you should because we don't have that basically it means you can I just about your audience or your clinically insane you you have that but it's much more under control so I think that transition from being afraid of a situation to being ok the situation and I see scary something can go on but think I will figure it out of it that is the transition of leader and that is I think the most challenging transition that leaders have to die had donefrom that ok it's not about physical bro it's about being accountable for other people's lives right that they must be the responsibility if your actions caused somebody else's that you have to face the video on the offence of that kid and say your father was under my command when he died at that burden of command be sure to wear those are the things that actually make leaders much more afraid not afraid but do the things that way on the leaders mind much more than oncestarted to blur it isn't just the bladder muscle memory which takes over your training which takes over it was awarded substitute of cubes of metal is such that you really cannot am in as they say all the best laid plans they didn't survive first contact with the enemy so I think that's the biggest fear for address for me it was an answer for many of the leaders of spoken to that will I be worthy of the command that is given to me that is so blackKendriya the situation like to Kargil war with the end I am is ahead the end of turn towards that situation what's the overall emotion in like a young adults life all I want someone who just begin their tenure in the army or even the Air Force 1 is the third ok this is what my life as lead up to at what is your I think before the war soldiers don't look forward to go I don't have a nice look forward to work because we know what are 7.62 mm bulletyou know when you get hit by a bullet you don't sing a song and you know it doesn't happen if you have not been a hit but I have seen have seen people and an ah it's terrible suspenseful so I don't think soldiers look forward to work but all soldiers know that this is the reason by the been trained this is this is the it is a bit like you've been training to become a cricketer all your life and one day your call to play for the Indian cricket team you know the ball890 kilometres in are you know if its head you die but that's what you have trained for the spot your so this is definitely a sense of awe and using the word The Lord of caution eagerness to say I want to go I want to participate in this battle is happening I want to go and participate and a very common it's very very common that when a battalion gets deployed to an operational area like in Siachen more Kargil officers were on deputation who are on some other unit in a comfortable posting and all they believe that can come to join the unittheek hai abhi Mera I don't want to stay in Delhi with my pattern is going to operation so I have to be with the bottom right so there is that sense of how can my boy is going to battle and I am not there with them there is a chance of in that sense of participation is there so I think but at the same time soldiers also know that what happens in Kargil is not what happens in the movie LOC it is a very different reality and and breakdown in youto see somebody dying in screen Akshay Kumar ki picture Mein that that family is devastated for the rest of their lives in the father financially the family may be in a very very different situation so it's it's that is a permanent mistake mistake Saman body wax is not like this quarter we do not meet the target will make up for it in the next quarter this Kota to create a video stream is a bit of the rest of my life sothere is that sense of reality which is still not captured in films entertainment you should be added only Waffle that I would say one of the few words on this is accurate is something like Saving Private Ryan that tells you what combat is actually like most of the Other movies are much more about entertainment and bravado when all of that stuff so I think soldiers understand the reality more than what people see on in movies and TV shows another many peopleamazing border Rambo something that was when you join you see the reality there in the reality like any profession is extremely different from what you see look at a shoot that happens for a song sequence right and was in a shooting a song sequence of days it takes to get that 3 minute song now somebody watching the addressafter sometime they have fever that allowed to do so the reality on ground is usually very very different from what is depicted in an entertainment medium entertainment medians intentions to entertain not to educate you on reality writing that difference is there between the films and what will happens in a life so like unhin so in the 90s serving like as a 7298 what was that Johny liver ful I was in Punjab that was my first postingthe Play School Sangrur and 1987 Punjab still not out of the woods in terms of terrorism so there's still a lot of operations - commissioners in peanuts that were happening so that's why I cut my teeth should speak my second tenure was in Siachen talking about my combat Association was added to an athlete there is nothing to worry about it and tell you why with 80% of the army has been in this whole ideas and I was in Seattlebecause every year we have 6 battalion 627 battalion there every year the 6 battalion get irritated been there for more than 3839 years now so you do the Math will figure out that by and large every unit would have been there so just for the sake of youth EP could you just described the action of it like that like so sia sia changes of course known as the highest in the cold is battlefield in the world this is an simplifying it but essentially it is in thethe northernmost part of India you can say and the contention is so what happened is in 1971 and the lines were being drawn on the last that area not sure but south of Siachen was we had some operations happening then took a few places after that the understanding that we have is that up to point NJ 9842 the point on the map and the line there of is Indian territory Pakistan isn't that linea different way we saline there often be moved up not they move like this so there is a area which is under contention with normal with neighbouring countries especially hostile bordering countries it happens it is the altitude their range between 18 to 21 22 thousand feet 18000 feet to put it in references khardungla pass and sure many of the business might have gone to Le and that headache want to khardungla pass 10 o'clock in the morning and returned by 11 O'Clock and in Allentown for 2 daysit is like that the posts are very soldiers will spend anywhere between three months until 6 months on top of that post your mostly existing on canned food you are very low oxygen very low as again this is very difficult to explain to people what -40 is the temperatures dip to aur - 40 - 45 easy way for you to understand what -40 is really going to they put your hand in the freezer of your fridge that -19 so if you exponentially double it not incrementally exponentVTU -43 understand what -40 isn't and keep your hand inside the freezer for about 5 minutes 5 minutes and you will realise what it means can then try and visualise people who believe in that condition for one year so that was my second the operational tenure my third one was as a part of a UN peacekeeping contingent contingent in Angola and all the more I have a couple of questions the first question is if you have to meet people from theKhesari troops what's the underlying emotion of an Indian soldier like is the emotion that the enemy is there is a sense of respect that you want to probably a parallel journey to me and maybe one day we might meet battle that the first person second question is more about Siachen have you seen people like break down the Aligarh a mental breakdown occurs as possibly at least according to Commercial perspectives and most Indians would believe that such is the most extreme environment and Indian soldier but after birthit is one of the most extreme environment that our environment which are more extreme than that right there are certain areas like and several other places where it since then I would say that at least the resource the ellipse and all work much better a certain areas which are and always remember it's not it's not a set of circumstances which can be compared like for example if I want to say that serving in Siachen is very very tough serving a submarine isequality of your insider tube which is inside the water God claustrophobia imagine if you got claustrophobia and you are inside that and you know that any point of time one of these systems fails I am in a steel coffin which good as it happened happened so it is not about the temperature it is about the fragility of your life reality of uncertainty why you don't know next three hours maybe we'll get hyperthermia maybe you'll get pulmonary edema maybe Oxygen will run outside that answerwhich makes a traumatic what are the training to combat the situations when roots are going to any operational area there are two types of training one is what we call area familiarisation so anybody who's been there will be inducted into shares and through a process in a place called the base camp there train duration in Mountaineering skills rescue skills climbing slithering how to take out people how to control of that stuff they are trained and a person that metal cutting which has been happening over a period of time andthat is also part of training when you are being constantly innocent of being put through stressful conditions that also for the training so you question about like honestly I don't think it's a bit like I explain this to my friends by saying that lets say you are fighting a court case with somebody that whatever god forbid not but lets your fight of the pakistani pakistani that an example let's say you have a lawyerwhat do you see your lawyer talking to the opposite party is low and their happily talking you should be fighting the Indian Army soldier is acting on the orders of the Government of India I can often say this the Indian Army is the last hundred metres of the government policy what are the government policies of the government policies to support the Tamil Rebels then the Indian Army does that efforts to Nau Din Nau Nau I will not support the Tamil levels will support the Sri Lankan Government that is also the Indian Army is doingnot acting on its own it is unfortunately a democracy is a Tax under the direction of the political establishment so to that extent I don't think there's any personal Himmat you want to have personal anumati against her when you are in Indian and you will share when India fights against Pakistan in a cricket match schedule route for India but if you go abroad and your roommate or other classmates is a Pakistani another is that it's not that I don't think there is a hatred for the other side andI think anybody the my belief anybody who's this respect is enemy is being fundamental stupid because you may not agree with the other side he may be the enemy but you can't disrespect we do that you'll be stupid Google make mistakes you do overconfident using our soldiers are I think all over the world soldiers are equally good they are equally patriotic I don't in Patriotism is the prerogative of any Armysoldiers have a sense of honour regardless of the size of the country if you take a guy from the Sri Lankan special forces is as patriotic and as good as willing to die for Sri Lanka as from the United States seals if you just because us got issues but that doesn't mean that their Commando is hundred times better than a special forces guy from lete Nepal it's not true and definitely not true maybe he may be better equipped and all that but definitely not true in terms of Patriotism and you see in the wayBT Americans that come from it comes from a sense of awe and the Afghan taleban and now send back the US it took us more than a decade Plus and 5 trillion dollars to finally except in all qualified arrangement which many people might quality feet and so I don't think this saying that those too stupid we are superior and that's very silly I don't think there is any personal animatiBadi yes when operations are happening yes in the heat of the better they may be instances where certain things will happen that may make you hate that particular unit that you are fighting against it does happen but having said that I think you may not know this that in Kargil war there was citations which gallantry award citation that were written by the Indian Army on Pakistani officers testimonials know we set the isko Milana chahie Tumhara jo bhi HotaZeeshan Haider dete Hue Hamare Param Vir Chakra Maha Vir Chakra isko Dena chahie Tum Logon Ko what is done is creditable and I am saying is that this guy for 12V ki did his job as a soldier soldier to you respect for 12 Years a combination of your mental decisions as well as your physical vala so if you find a soldier who has fought well regardless of which I mean you have to admireHai To tab is a good guy is there any sports competition and lets see your competing against somebody Lesnar boxing and a box that every every so I don't think soprofessional soldiers there is no personal A trade amongst your enemy but I don't think so so this is only one of the best podcasts we had actually let me be honest there and just telling you the stories of other people and that is why it is so and the storyteller here and not the one who is the story Dua so obviously when you tell stories of so many different people who have done it it will seem to be good but that's because of their storyAam is a sense of fun for lack of a better word spirituality within like the army force of course I think what is spirituality Pranam also used to tell this to my friends that when you get posted to the Glacier you become a little more religious and there are two reasons for that one reason is a cause a little closer to God physically the second reason is when your life is hanging by a balance when you don't knowlook back in your own life the maximum time you pray to god is Mahima in some deep shit someone loved ones like in the hospital someone is Innova accident hone wala hai something I have before an exam Roja praying to God bargaining with your please God yah Karoge To Main aapko Vaishno Devi milunga in any kind of situation spirituality and extremely important part so much so that every Army battalion of the world not just in the Indian Armywill have a spiritual teacher will have like in a battalion Dele BA Pandit Ji Se Sikh unit will be a Granthi there will always be like in the US Army the chaplain who will come with you in the matter is a soldier because when you are faced with death then you have to make peace at somewhere that species usually comes with a sense of spirituality and religion and spirituality do you feel that presence of God or presence of a forceKapil to induce a please see me through this ironically the other side of the brain to the same that that was a part of the day is it is just before any combat operations against any operation before your being launch before field firing begins before training begins does a proper Puja that is carried out blessings are sought and you have local diabeteswho are there who are sometimes like this is anecdotal stories about you know the Glacier there is a temple which is called the pressure cooker Baba mandir and the story is that it's working as I was fired which Ben 10 Bank into the pressure cooker and blue that after saving about 20 people who run the barracks very close by the pieces of that aluminium pieces of that pressure cooker are kept in a Shrine and they worshipped now where does the sense of spirituality come with a piece of aluminium from a pressureit is a symbolism that this saved lives and therefore there is something that is empowering this when you start seeking Solace in anything that can give you solution spirituality is usually the smallest that most humans from come to when we are in a time of fear real example that you must have gone through most people would have gone through the last yearmouth and you're making promises that because you feel that my life and that beginnings happening with whom is happening with you not working with your head on your mum with both you bargaining with some Power that you reached out to when you are in deep trouble that my mind is a form of spirituality it only then any people have that was writtensome token some metal piece some in this emulator some bracelet someone's mother is given them something they lucky coin all what are the symbols of getting a sense of courage from some inanimate object but the inanimate object symbolises A belief that you have that the Agar hoga to I will be safer than that again because we have aspirituality top on the spot on a line that I read only on a life fortunately was in one of the spiritual book I read it called the autobiography of a yogi so a line that stayed with me was if you don't welcome God in the summer of your life he may not be than the windows to protective so it just was control character switching mode me back to army talk so like a god ask you about your time in Africa's we'll also likewhen you but before I ask you that when you see after 10 years ending on goes on in a soldier's head because you have gone through it really harsh and of situation you put a physical body of mental body through it so is there a sense of ok this is done now let's move on to the next what goes on in army officers head through the journey of his career I think about the next mission in Vice thinking about your career goals honestly don't to be pretentious to pretend that I can tell youArmy officers heads and each has a different in each head things are kept in a different way so I will be very silly of me to assume that I can tell you what went on my head I can tell you what happened with I think this is a sense of relief when you and the mission without losing lives with using as minimal lives as possible and achieving the objective of the objective is to safeguard that sector of wherever you are deployed for a period of one year and you manage to do that you make sure that most of yourall of them all of them or alive not injured and your hand over the sector that you've got to the next battalion which is good to take over a good state which means in of the Russians are stocked and everything is over this is a bit like AC and inverter neck receive a sense of satisfaction that I am living under good conditions that is the admission my mind that was the former thing I still remember my so when I was going up Dinanath Verma I think one of my finest teachers in leadershipchronically was also my teacher in the infantry School leavers Inspector there and then had the honour to serve with him in his battalion of the practice of the Indian Army 12 geography as it's called 12th battalion of the Jack refreshment Jammu Kashmir Rifles 2 come out a different person at the end of a you come out as a different person you come out with a different person is a perspective to life you look at life differently you look at what was important it happens LSA you survive a car crash I am sorry mustardand excellent service when you think you come out as a very different person you should listen I was almost gone and I need to look at my life now in a very very different way I'll tell you a story very interesting story about this to know the head of cost of mine unfortunately is no more Tomar and Arvind Tomar and he is to actually say this is so we had another cosmetic I want to take his name to protect the privacy so he was when he was in Hindiis listening will not all my question is who can talk about when he was in Hindi he dived into the swimming pool and his head hit the ground is very good I was straight into the water and he went unconscious and he was inside the pool and by the time the instructors with Ben 10 and got out and all that he was taken to the hospital and use the client that and then again is heart restarted and all that any survived and efficacy of the twins training camp 2 Indian Military Academy in the worldmost physically fit guys but he was very very you know about stuff in life in everything had to happen exactly the same way and very good quality but I miss you died everyday is a bonus for you Ja you diet your life and that each day you are living now is a bonus for you leave that day with the gratitude that this is a bonus which is true for all of us astrologerI'm not fallen into a pool and it does not mean that the Accident happened today morning it could have anything could happen in millions of people diagnosed with life terminal disease everyday is just lottery that you and I am not an it as of now it can happen anytime but that attitude to know the fragility of life to know that it's very very temporal all the things that you know give us join value and all of that can when is like this and very often peopleme that I am very stressed and all of that another one bad one of your reports by mistake is diagnosed as some terminal disease Tera Sara problem make the main thing we don't need to wait for that to happen to us if we are Cognizant of it and realised how blessed we actually ionically everyone who is listening to this right now able to understand English has enough resources to be able to watch thisit may be as in education to comprehend it you already belong 2.00000 1% of Indian humanity which has got these planets align the right so instead of looking at how many planets are to fall in line for you are me your to be here where they are the right education right family light background right people to get bet Honours Right To Pal Pal 10 out of trouble at the right time so many planet have to fall in line for us to be where we are today I think you will automatically feel a sensehappiness because if anyone on this planet earth move the site any other but for the grace of God what's the difference between you and a migrant labour who had to walk like a hundred kilometres and kilometres before he reached a house with a lottery it's not because you work harder than any was Pali 10 times harder than you might think if we put those things in perspective I am Theory on this by the way have you noticed that all the great religious placesare located in very difficult to reach places abhi to Jata Hai helicopter these places which are hard to achieve hard to reachthis software free things first thing is you not go there for Badi refractive exam pass kara do you know that serial problem problem secondly when you will go to the journey it gives your sense of agency Ki Main Kuchh karna my child is suffering from cancer I am doing something you can do anything with your doctor you can do anything beyond taking the child to a doctor and back but you get a sense of urgency that I am putting myself through trauma to assist my childmost importantly the what happens during the journey listen to the troubles of others that to my mind is an exercise which we can start doing ourselves we don't need life to do this we can do that and one of the reasons why is think over the ways in which we can get joy and happiness is actually to spend a lot of time with situations in individuals whomuch less privileged and are not together since he doesn't have it and I have it but to get a sense of how lucky I am that what I have been taking for granted is something that somebody else's ko waiting for the entire life and still will not get it right and you do that I think the comparison with somebody use underprivileged then you will give you happiness the comparison with someone who were privileged then you will always give yourself that's the rule of life so I thinkvetan helps everyday in the army and helps exercise back muscle is value of this perspective it does and let me know it's not like everyday in the Army of aging combat what is it so this is there in the back of the head but like any other organisations is got 42 50% of what you don't see is the regular but that has to happen all which is as routine as any other career so every year to ask a fighter pilot killed over 30% the word which is completely route30% which is the richest to enable a professional look at what you see is usually not what you get because that's what you get is a much bigger in which some pieces you like some please most pieces you won't like the trick is to find a profession where at least 40 to 50 person that you doing is very exciting which gives you if I have to ask you a question about family and then will move into your Africa tenure but what's what lekin army officerdance of family caregivers are you staying away for a while how does that work out once again I want to know many of these answers which I want to give I don't want to make it as if it's like you can Merchant Navy look at the pool was sailing or thousands and thousands lacks of people who work abroad in Dubai or wherever in from all walks of life who publishes a family once in a year they lucky maybe twice and yes this is not a having said that in the armygiven that in your 20-25 years career what about time is spent there will be substantial portions of that time that you will spend away from your immediate family the fortunate part of that is that neither you will be away from your largest family because your part of the unit and you will your family be away from the larger family because she is also part or in case the spouses the lady of the spouse is also a part of the larger family so you know by and large will be looked after they somebody you can421 phone call will make sure that someone will watch out for them and that what we call regimental spirit or a spirit of security code of saying that the other officers family or whatever is a very strong very strong mechanism there so to that extent I think it is part of the part of the Year pictures pictures like for the course that happens if so what happened in Africa and how is that different like from India and how are youthis is part of UN mission Indian Army keep sending troops into United Nations missions be likely one of the largest contributor Sab troops to you and missions am very very well respected by the way in United Nations then how how is the Indian Army perceived life on my own a very very highly respected Army for the simple reason that we are one of the most combat experience armies in the world so we are fought in glaciers mountains were fought in jungles Assam the effort in deserts of Rajasthan we are 40MPBSE Vinod use coastline we know amphibious operations and other source and a very very battle hardened Army because not very many Army had been fighting for so many years does India has been an event fighting since Independence being back and hard and plays a role in actual combat because the strategy and seasoning of seasoning of troops imagine if you can experience crew to go and shoot with Sachin Tendulkarthey will operate their faced by first person shall be no rights to the first time the battle hardening is a matter of fact in training we have a concept called battle in Operation where this Atlee firing Machine Gun fire all of that happening life fire is not simulation life fire and you like crawling in trenches under that there is a simulation but there is no there is no replacement in training for actual combat I think Bruce Leethe best if you watch Enter the Dragon where o'hara comes and breaks the board in front of him and we summarise it 19 boards don't it back target don't you do when you are in training and when in real combat target suit back that exposes the completely different side of of combat shooting back at you say it's not about your marksmanship it's the marksmanship while you are being shot at so I am combat experience thousand in soldiering that is the benchmark24 lyrical the Indian armed forces have been one of the most experienced in that space and very battle had done a very efficient Army the operational level at least it like we can just kind of going with the stereotype for example in cricket in every cricket team and offering an element of their own country into the game the Western during the relax player power in the Indian cricket team is supposed to be one of those intelligent teams that are applied to the army wherecomparison between cricket on this but different cultures of the different culture of the Indian Army is also multitude of a multitude of seeing this most of the army officers and to a certain extent Army brat will understand what I'm saying for example if you are commissioned into let se a certain battalion and a name into an people know what I'm talking about you are expected to do a lot of my bahan because that's theculture language of those people we want to appreciate something up in your way you treat the very different from the way you treatif you look at the Indian Army there are a multitude of regiments each Resident Evil cast composition on your way to the troops are taken from a certain area Soya the Gurkha Bihar Jat Maratha coronavirus latest India ka so that certain special forces all India cal se Satna Mein treatments which already my own battalion was all India all company in each one of these arrangements as a different culture different culture different food habits are different but was at a much more rice oriented Madan Battalionbeat oriented all this is different everything is the way they addressed the way they talked with your order is a pass everything is different but when the chief of Army says hafton write 1.5 million people not specified in this will not debate on that it's a very interesting phenomenon that corporations should study that while you have independent cultures in each of the department's you can either or neither can Reliance example the culture of the oil refiningarea is very very different from fairytail very different from jio to very different what is a common vocabulary so when the common vocabulary half turn nobody has a debate is 45 degree and 45 56 one so if you are able to create a common operational vocabulary you can allow a multitude of cultures to flourish because you do need different cultures so I'll give you an example andkab is working with the lines you had the same campus the oil and gas establishment and also you so very interesting ideas to help the risk and security and you went there and I joined there I was fascinated that if you have to go in the campus schedule knows it that you do not have to swipe your card everywhere and every door you decide the callSumit job security 300 take pride in the fact that in a kind of that when people go home Ghar Mein Basa bathroom Aisa karta hai because it's so ingrained into the head now in the jio cloud came and beverages jobs as your where is your age and young Leader and all that they found this very very destructiveall the time but this is clearly a mismatch of cultures and they don't know there was even something as bad because they don't know the origin of the reason behind the origin of the reason as in a oil and gas refining environment is a very very high security environment because the slightest of tweaks can explode the whole refinery has to be an alt like I don't know that vehicles that go into the refinery they have special equipment fitted in the exhaust so that no sperm comes out your boots are checkedJodi No nails tips to that no question of carrying a lighter or anything useful things that can be carried more importantly as the head of risk of a refinery I need to know where each and every individual is because there is a fire and have to bring down of firewall to protect 2000 people which will kill 50 people inside another thing that all I need to know exactly where each and every person is not that DNA which requires you to footwearInsurance claim karne ke liye Pata Hona chahie na Yuva that there is a God forbid there is an accident and bodies of birth beyond Ragni only record is where you were right only record that you are in that plane and wife can claim insurance after the crash happens is the passenger manifest your dead body is not so sorry but that is the culture origin not is being viewed by another group has a very very reasonable that it's very important to realise thatconglomerate will have multiple cultures in multiple divisions because the requirement of the jobs I'll give an example I used to be CEO of a company called automatic which is now known as First Choice it was a start up at that point of time it was all about dotcoms in this and that in all t-shirts and coming in shorts to office like very much your Indian share was ok just fine but when it was expected to do that but then I used to have another company Kaun Mahindra special Services Group which was much more about and securityin black and there you have to be in a suit and tie always that the culture of the service that you delivery so I think organisations can have and has India only has multitude of working culture and their own emotional culture but when it comes to operations they have one common vocabulary so you can have multiple cultures so long as you have a common denominator of a common vocabulary I think that's a great lesson to be learnt from that somewhere line got that that's the underlying Saktain terms of culture is a some kind of emotion that also type Indians together again I like the only the beginning of the Indian cricket team is the can't think of another matter for too kind of closely related to but when you think about Indian cricket team with a great batman since generations possibly because and maybe something a genetic mixer reflex is good of a technically sound some mobile is anything that kind of represent all Indian soldiers is it the sense of I don't know maybe intelligence why peoplelearn Indian cultural industry on the smartest populations in the world many years ago when you went to the US have actually is actually happened to me is not anecdotal actually this happen to me a guy's got a laptop to music and if so that stereotype because your known by that I mean I don't follow concert at this point but I don't follow cricket at all but I can I can sense why so when you are facing 6 Foot 6 bola vs hundred and eightypassing a ball at you at the speed of 200 kilometres in are you can't fight that with force you are to use technique to use the same guy speed and twist your wrist and use that forced to get a bit like jujitsu so if you are not as physically strong as your open and you have to use hi and form of technique which is basically what the cricket team has evolved into you can't have share massive fast bowlers who buy share bulk and size will propel the ball at a speed u can'ttechnical players who play with the mind of the opponent and play Chess with them rather than playing brute force within that the Americas and oversimplified not like other people don't have technique and all but that's how the orientation begin to similarly in the armed forces also I think I would say Indian acchi Indian Army is a broad term the group has been a very differently Nagar be a very differently cosby have very different it is a very different culture matter of fact even in sector 9reasons there are certain kind of food should do very very well because of their inherent announce that the goods are known as it quite Warriors other known superb for fighting real god battles which means that you are there surrounded but they will fight a real god battle to make sure that last man last Town Hall 6 unit has a very exploitative you give them a situation they will explode that situation that is the same again it's the same reason why decadesnot even born you find in Indians in Canada and Australia as a container Mein baith ke exploited to go away from their very veryteacher seeking outside my own methods may be much more in word and therefore much more cultural influences which which is there are you can't expect to lead an organisation in Chandigarh the same way you will need it in Pondicherry expected that different culture soIndian soldiers are known for their professionalism they are definitely known for their intelligence node debate on that Indian soldiers are feared in many countries that you'll see our equipment and you'll reverse Engineer at wishes to you do that very often will see something will modified I want to name it specifically but there are several equipments that we use will be on the Rangers given by the manufacturer by doing around modifications and taking it to another level 83 in ArmyIndian forces because when you are to improvise with no resource and your life is at stake you better invent something and you make this your business and your life at stake so I think those are the traits for which the Indian armed forces are in a respected all over the world in the armies of the world also and and and of course there are many other places where we apply BA taken part in Indian Army takes part in international Commando competitions and all that where we are usually in the top three soit is a highly experienced and Battle hardened army and gets its credit in Hindus areas and operational excellence what was it like in Africa visit more of the same or different all un peacekeeping missions are different than an orderly fighting in any other it's no any me you are not taking us Troops and saying Bharat Mata ke liye blood I think it is much more about inspiringwith the fact that their brand ambassador of India Yuva India Bans on your shoulder everything that you do will reflect on not just the Indian Army but on the nation of India and Rio you discover that exercising restaurant at X is more nerve-wracking than actually being in combat because you have to exercise restraint what are you similar words to explain that so normally what happens if you are afraid of going into a battle butauraton se baat going to matter but sometimes not launching force also requires a lot of restraint and that restaurant might be more difficult than actually launching a tolerance tolerance saying OK bye ok ok let's not let not react now let's not right now we are to cool the situation dan Gadhvi in the situation down make a cooler cooler cooler so that requires a different remind grit your teeth and be angry at what the other person is said but yet to come the situation down and somewhat what is the contextBengal Tiger Bus part of a contingent on their and basically what happens is whenever the UN declared as a peace settlement between Lake and it was between the ruling Government and the Rebels this work was the UN intervention there is to make sure that both sides are obeying the rules of the agreement so there are three components of everyone mission one component is called the military staff officers who run the country because the country has to be withvote on country Pani bijali medical $1 the tasvir structure would do that basically be people who will be coming from various different means of the world even not Amazon police coaching IPS officer IPS officers go to have a Civil Servant to go there and all of that to help stop the judicial system help set up all of that stuff so please our staff officers to build the country rebuild the country help in rebuilding the country when you have a military observers the observers role is basically to see whether the rules that I've been formas a peace agreement are being followed Sudheer report then we have the third component which is called Blue helmet helmet size actual combat troops this combat troops are sent to enforce in some cases if it has to be enforced the rule of the United Nations are the agreement of the two parties as part of the UN blue helmet and thankfully there was not very volatile situation there Western Turkey moments but not not something like Somalia and all thatI want to attack Attack by the by the Rebels in the locals but it was a great opportunity to learn from several different Armies great opportunity I must say to I think it was an angle of that I really appreciated what Mahatma Gandhi did for our country and find it very weird because what happened in Angola was and governance achieve theirtrue wireless never Devara Devara like ruled by the Portuguese and I have to tell you that given a choice between being ruled by the British and the Portuguese Ishwar despite whatever they have done was still not something the parable that was my because I know what they are they didn't have the does your local language of a country which is 34 size of India didn't have a local language they had only Portuguesebeen wiped out so a nation that achieved its freedom through violence continue to try and solve problems through various cultural 1975 the two parties both the parties to resolve it just like this and that country had been at war for the next twenty twenty five years just news recently is it sort of come down to peace but 95 when I was there will be back showvery clearly you realise your own culture the strengths of your own culture weaknesses also when you look at it from another person's eyes when you look at it your own eyes you are often not able to spot that serial dual you see through the eyes of the others and you admire now I get the great contribution that that mandate to create to use and environment variable to protest non-violent liya still protesting for protecting on violentlyvisa via country which got its objectives with violence and therefore they had that solution for every problem that they had dropped so it was a great experience in that sense and positive last and then I came back and then I had another tenure in Suratgarh that's one of our border areas in Rajasthan and after that I was posted as an instructor in the armoured Corps centre and school which is available whereI was working with young officers would then be taking their own troops into battle and that's when I saw the exit from the earlier so this part was originally started with antenna explaining your career but I love that it turned into an Army special and I think we'll be doing a sequel episode about what happened after your time in the army had like to end this particular podcast by asking you about the youth today so a lot of people my agein my 20s now grew up watching Laksh and Laksh was a movie that really kind of turned towards the army in the modern day have two questions for the first is that what is the future of the Indian Army looking like like in terms of how we prepare for the 2020 and 30s are is artificial intelligence will be a part of the more advanced pieces of Warfare that I like kind of finding its way into in army and secondly why shouldjoin Indian Army today 16 B answer this two question separately so of course you're probably would be aware that he might not have thought about consciously that every technology that you use today originated from war so weather is laser into internet that you should think and all of that stuff artificial intelligence unit Drone shows everything has originated from what are the reason that jet engines rocket when a nation is fighting for his existit's obviously going to put its best resources to transfer the problem might affect the number of technological innovation that happened the second world war in terms of the amount that was done that to 4 years but probably never have been achieved thereafter because that that compelling reason wasn't there to build a rocket right now to find better metallurgy to do this to do that all those things so pretty much every technology that you see as had its Origins and probably it's the government and the armed forcesactually play with first having said that we buy the nature of our trained are a very manpower intensive and has to be because they were very long and very disparate different orders via Jungle Villa mountain view of desert amphibian role we have also heard Island locations that have to be protected all of this and that basically makes the army very very manpower orientedcountry largely oriented having said that technology is coming in in all of these various things like artificial Intelligence and all of that have a role to play in certain areas of the amine is much more to do with Intelligence and men and big data and logistics also by the logistics is a very very interesting area in the army where artificial intelligence is immensely valuable logistics of everything in the end of the day Wars are fought on logistics alonekhana Kaise pahunche exam let's say that you have a Garrison in Bikaner division so their tanks and their light tanks and artillery pieces this that bakels hundreds and hundreds of vehicles to just design the Logistic chain for them but the vehicles are not of the same vintage them not the same number of kilometres Kisi Ka fan belt change karna hai Kisi Ka sprocket change ka natak dikhaiyeas a record which you know that its maintenance to be done this has to be done that has to be done the troops were posted over there they might prefer more of the troops will have ration sweetheart oriented towards grain leather with rice and this and that the Managing this entire complexity where every vehicle has got its own individual idiosyncrasies is not like 40 times are bought and given to the pattern together is not like all 40 times within the same number of fleet Street but each vehicle init is a completely different individual and therefore the Logistic China's to Cater for the right switch off very very complex logistics won the most complex exercises in the forces officers of the world and as they say that you know the generals fight on strategy but the field marshals fight on logistics because logistics is what enables me to win or lose and will see that in the Second World War the German in Eastern front collapse because ofnot because the Tucson not braver they cannot fighter know this basically because the tanks did not have diesel to so without petrol without fuel it will not move forward if you have mentioned train does not reach you you cannot fight who does not arrive you will not be able to sustain processor logistics is the Bedrock of something everything has a civil Union everything that you do you think this is all the way up on vision of the army is ok fighters brave intelligent but it made the physical and so many levels of organisationtune every dollar you see a movie you see the hero doing that prancing around and all that you know the value chain behind to make that happen starting the makeup artist to this that there are so many other layers with normal civilian does not see around see the only see the final product so that is part 1 the path to why should Indian youth join the Army is very good question I think I am answered it another forum slightly flippantly at that point of time in which they gave thisconcept that pretty much everything that you are going to learn in management span of command amount of troops under you what is the given I am in your life that you don't know about an example in good old days the things would not keep you standing Army point we not fighting bye have a standing Army so they have a small standing army and whenever there was a battle of the crisis of whatever the emperor will send out that was Jodhpur se itne log bhejo Jaipur se from different Subahdifferent visarlas as they were known at that point of time Subah so that's where the word Suvidha comes from similarly the payroll system those days so in people salary would be handed over to the cinemas to guy and he told the strong ka Hawala aapko Diya jata hai so instead of the subedaar if the Subedar could not come out and is Deputy is the sub inspector it all comes from the original so a lot of that lessonslearn in B schools I think our second hand lessons the primary fountainhead is there so one great opportunities to learn that from the primary fountain and the second is like I explain the year the camaraderie the bonding and that wealth that you will create over there is again a great thing to process for life at a lot of my inner people who listen that joined to Theniyour location to join Patel news June 18 years will be groom from the age of say about 20-25 that usually the bracket at which people join up to 30 35 and you'll come out into the street as an individual who is equipped for handling pretty much everything in life that life throws at you you will be able to in acid of life will put you in the chest from 20 floor building you'll temple and fall on your feet because you didn't rain how to do that so that the second reason I would say the third reason iswhat happens when a young man or woman joins and Organisation does there be a joint letter in MNC than an MNC there in this part they mention that they might see them from this MLC to another dimension there in the same place even if you change cities what is the difference between you living here in Bombay inside the other and living in Sarojini Nagar in Delhi is exactly the same thing is exactly the same but this is a profession which will give you two to three years of changeyou'll go to places you should normally never go to UC Jungle that you never be in your place there are places in Siachen and I'm sure and many other areas where if you go on one day we just decide walking Ashok let me walk along this trail of this Raven you could actually be setting your foot in a place where no human being as ever been there that exposure and that I will the other and even when you are under training the convex polygon given ranging from horse riding swimming Poloflying in a leader's everything that even millions can't afford it you can't take my friends and I was posted in Ahmednagar they will not one they were to Golf courses in that really small town because it had the armored core regimental Centre so they had their Golf Course and mechanization so imagine a place where there is so much of golf course that we had to officially detail students into Jayegathat's the kind of resources that are available that can I think that part of your career that part of your life when you are young when you can move around when your ok to experiment with life is a great place to go and to serve their for 10 years come back to the knowledge of Innova that forces tissue come back to the shoes family that exists there and that always be family for you are the reasons whypeople should join it teaches entrepreneurship teaches you innovation gets you that Band of Brothers cycle all those things men and fix it is one of the Institutions which like so many of my classmates batane engineers after the join the army Cantt to NDA Deccan to I am a chosen genius two Signals and they were made into a full-fledged engineers full-fledged Pilots full-fledged missile Pilots these are skills that arelife skill not only meant by tenure in the army wali hope that there are some kids watching this will come to 10 years from now on such that one podcast that he saw you want kind of convinced him to join the army or multiple kidsfootball video just told me that it's today think differently I could be different for every generation is different speeds different different everything final question for you again I want to ask you this as the soldier form of you and not the corporate and not the motivational speaker on the day that your dying if you had to just flash one memory ofschedule in the army to be peaceful a violent or whatever it is but what defines at your whole sensibility as a soldier that if there is one manual flash and provides a question I really don't know what memory will flash that point of time but if I were to actually looked back at that instant when I spend and I think it it it's the most formative in ocean of everything that I've learnt in terms of their ability to communicate theirlead understanding Technology the passionate about the army is that we don't have the luxury of win over 4 years courses short intense courses will teach you about sophisticated technology in a compressed time frame and you'll be good enough to operate it and good enough to do in your stuff that another that stuff all of them are skills that are utilised again and again again skills is not it's not like you learn the skill of how to disassemble a riflese 6 seconds you learn the skills that you can disassemble anything if you put your mind to it in about 10 to 15 seconds and reassembled back with a sophisticated Pizza interesting they'll tell you something when I joined my unit at the 22nd May 22nd and endothermic nice infantry Regiment Elite unit crack unit for Banai joint it was a new racing was the new new released unit and this was one of the first three units who were given new equipment whichBMP to Abhi MP infantry squad infantry but it is a carrier which carries people into combat vehicle so it was a new generation and because it was a new generation reported from Russia everything was induction everything controls were in Russian the manuals were in Russian the knowledge that 10th class pass Jawan they figured it out they figured out a cup and like IR infrared night night vision devices is thatfigured it out and that gives you the confidence to say that even with a sophisticated machinery you allow kids to play whether they will Discover how to operate computer as they will Discover how to operate YouTube they will Discover how to they will discover it and you don't need to feel appearance of this skill said that is good for you for the rest of your life rest of your life you know that I have to lunch I know this today that if I put my passion to learning photography maybe in about 6 months time I will be about 70 to 80%as good as may be the best not the best but a very professional building No 6 months because I can learn it in an accelerated manner that skill of learning accelerated accelerated learning is universe exist in our ability to transition from One dimension to another dimension because you are able to learn it fast because you are the confidence that I've learnt sophisticated SAP in a short time before enable is like the four minute barrier you know the story so Rodger bannister4 minut diarrhoea for the one mile run and within months away breaking at dozens of people start breaking and why does it happen because it it is a contract that is artificial in the head is an artificial limitation months and limitations been removed people a Jaega To Main bhi kar sakta hun tu ja bhi sakta that is very very important thing I would think about that produce anything that I achieved or whatever I am today your originatethe term from the Xperia why we haven't touched upon those topics in this episode and I know that it's not a intention in life let after talking your come to know that you know your Sanu changes knowledge you changes changes the next level of growth money is an outcome of growth getting enough financially stable is an outcome of growth of learning more so is it fair to say that the army equipped as a man to be much more financially stable than you would happen if your chosen and otherall your life or rich compared to some which is a state of mind which is the state of mind while I understand that can be put it this way I think what is the army and again I want to qualify the sun's is not true for the army is to for all government servants ets2 for all who exist on what many corporate counterparts would save 50000 but how can you manageit teaches you that 50000 rupees a month is more than enough if you want to be happy about right and 50 million is not enough if you are not happy about it so it all the more services I must say that they teach the real wealth is the education of the children the value systems that you are put in place and and matter of fact more often than not have seen more wealth actually destroying things analysis and identity that Italking body to someone just recently that when we were young 30 years ago 40 years ago there is 1 TV in a house and people used to come from many many different houses to come and watch the Sunday kal I still remember when we got a TV in house in Green Park we had some family friends would ride in a scooter all the way from Narayana you don't know Delhi so they are very near Each Other because they were no traffic and all that but it was a ritual that family would come to ouryou and I are watching the same episode your reaction on that will tell me what you are right let's say during a controversial example Delhi Badli let se somebody what is coupled together and one person to have the building that you know more about the person thinking right or wrong but you know more about the person thinking but if he is watching papa in one room you are watching thappad another room you never get that interaction soplay Institute of Material assets usually results in poverty famous emotional isolation but it usually results in that so you on that pits it very well in Fight Club that things that you on actually end up owning you and I think the sooner the realisation come it came as a template to me it does come late to people but I think it did come in time for me to take a callok that's why I know I love the corporate like to say that I know this is it and I can continue and I was working for one of the most costly growing organisations in India and your weight is no hot topic of the next so it was growing and was great the bosses and a great window so there is no reason to leave except to say that there is something that you need to havemake you truly rich that something is enough enough I think the lesson of enough that is a very important lesson for somebody to for everybody to inositol and some people donate some people planet late some people never learnt and they continue to change objectives and all of that or material metal exchange or deny betting on material well because I just thinking that are so2 crores if you start making 3 cross with a slightly changed it is the food is good to eat change the place where is not understand what is happening is relative he feels that I am now become a bigger person than I was before because I am being paid more by the true that really true if what you are doing alien what you doing now is exactly the summary ask me I was 54 when I left Reliance last year and someone asked me this that this it's true that many people miniecharclick below to delete this the pic awning capability of individual and corporate is between the age of 48 255 that's the peak will now you are master knowledge build your contacts done your this thing and this is the time when you should be actually taking a premium on that and I will at this point of this is the time when you want to Goa bike ride I can go to just say ok fine I want to write to Le tomorrow I will not now but I can do that this is a time the warlittle have got I'll be able to spend it if I continue working for another 10 years let CIA mass more will the water and all around me so why would I am not look at the time I have as the most valuable resource this exercise with someone taught me actually and it's a good thing for you do you should do it all the listeners to do it also you should buy some Marbles you can use Marbles and marbles are goodlike that get about hundred of them for 200 them put the manager 52 of them represent one near 52 week and write ten years means 520 every week and take out one thread when you see the jar reducing is the first time you realise that the sand sand for the capital sand clock tower is called that our last Agla stocks and is running out and severe and it's very important atbecause you think you wanna live forever that I thought live forever is a sense of immortality and all that stuff so it's very important to start understanding the most valuable resource we are left with is the time that Bihar with and that is left for us and you may acquire more material but if you are not able to then it's only acquisition knowledge is I have got this also I got that also but it's really not something that you are going to be actuallybeing able to enjoy you some people are there mojo bike chasing the points guy might see my mojo is changing my was not really are made to crores more but the fact that I was telling that I think that's very myopic way of looking at one aspect of life which is just the material money and answer now I don't know the civilian protocol bad on behalf of the Indian youth I'd like to salute you are youthe people make it sound as if the Army's from a alien planet it comes you have and produce your many classmates friends will join the army if you look back at them is it normal that very few very few Indian Army professionals have been on podcast with the Indian youth listen to find whether that's not true that there isn't enough of it which is used in we started the spot where I think that I agree with you I think one of the majorI would say of the word is the fact that the Army's brand hasn't been built in the right way and it's a very testosterone driven brand it's a very you know much is more driven brand but that's not what the army is all about I think the army affects the Indian civilian far more in 82 civil authorities rescue them from floods keeping the peace doing all that stuff so I think that part of the army is a part of which is notreally talked about much more than using the word brand in the production and using it in the sense that after all who is the who is the Planet of the Indian Army Indian population right so what we do for the Indian population that were the Army of the Indian population is something that the Indian population should be aware when we see movies like Harry and in all the stuff that one aspect with us what we are doing to keep the boundary safe for what we are one the army is doing for people inside the country every year 50Jawan so have been trained in leadership been trained in handling and equipment has been trained sophisticated machinery the coming to the sea beach Street imagine the knowledge base that they come with the school of talent that become your and you study Telecom engineer I want to tell you an anecdote all this telcom that you see this Telecom revolution that happened in India is origin lies in army signals at the army signal officers who came out after retirement and most of the city was about 10today you'll find that their religion is there in the brain that knowledge that is coming to the nation right after all you have to remember it is the most expensive Academy in India you pay for it with your taxpayer money so when this resource after working for 20-25 years at the age of 35 most of the judgement when they come out that 35 to 40 because I joined the age of 20 December 20 25 years in the peak of their life they are out in the City Streetsuse resource that I will need to look into from all those perspectives also so if you did that I think the armed forces would be much I think that one definitions not that one thing that is not happened in India that the interface between the get get an and if that interface became much more solid which is there in most European countries and all that and there is a reason for that because all European countries in the United States dollar to INR existcrisis during war India's never had an existential crisis because even our most pitched battle in 1971 release south of the Deccan Plateau is really know I know this because it's because of that we have always had a arms length which was by design also the word cantonment comes from the fact that you contain the troops away from the civilian population but I think those those parents need to change and I'll tell you when they need to take to change becauseyears ago 30 years ago the battles were fought between soldiers today with terror and all that happening there for bicycle that's why I wrote the book Every man's what is Every man's A man was not a gender specific but this every individual Swan because you may not be interested in war but what is definitely interested in you you may not be interested in terrorism definitely interested in you can I am not interested in USA don't Bombay my hotel I don't care whether you're interested or notI think it's very important for an average Indian to know about national security to know about the implications of national security in the right now what is happening in China is not effective in this it will take to business people want to make investment in India and their ability to Aane Wala Pata Kare Ki Nahin Karen jhume jhume electronics Margao by ChinaChhotu think that this is something

I wanted the things I would change so I think you want to impress the girls ladki Kaise pataye so that the them that so I knew that if you want to get ahead in life you have to aim for that everything you want to have to practice and what can doing wellso that is what I wanted you to know that if you want something work for it happy Mothers Day you guys got my own mother today on beerbiceps Dr Swati allahbadia welcome to the Ranveer show happy to be here today at the Swati show why you're not comfortable being on YouTube and comfortable talking to PCone on one or giving lecture to my medical students but not in front of a camera whats the best and worst aspect of your mum best aspect is that is very fulfilling its like when you water a plant and seed grow then it's gives a sense of satisfaction especially if the plant grows where the worst part is specially for working women you always have the sense of guilt thatdone enough as a mother who you are not done enough towards your own career everything is compromise nothing away from stay at home mums I feel like when Orchid grows up seeing a working Moumita really good influence on the kids are life like it's not like it when used to go out when I was a kid like you remember ok my mum said she had a son she is very young your 82728 Aadmi so like I am over karejust taking off therefore as a doctor you had to leave the house and lot for emergencies and gynaecology emergencies and I was a very manipulator kid and telling you that you go I am feeling bad ok but please bring your jiju are you come back into the shop and then have a big smile on your face to ask you are manipulative but luckily we had your grandparentsboth were doctors so I didn't feel so bad about leaving you the only tough times were when you were not well and I had a serious patient then it became a real Dharam Sankat where to did you never worry about these shows the patient is the workaholic nature of the sum of positive that is usually they have some kind of backup at home so they know thatit will be ok and then they focus on the patient that like when I grow up and become like a motivational speaker or a youtuber or something like that one of the kid because there is no 1 family who is in any kind of screen presence or anything and I always thought youthe beaten path become either an engineer or a doctor or at the most loyal thought library of so to give you a very wild teenager wildcat really n****** I don't be expected that of myself like this whole doctor engineer think really anythingjumping around of the sofas and I was never sure whether you had learnt everything and you are always making faces that the nice part was it was great fun bringing you up because even if I was low or depressed you knew how to make me smile makes me laugh devices motivational video when you were younger very much but when you spoke those were many very often words of vizfor example once I was shouting at you to go and study and not waste time and you look very wisely at me and told me that you know there is no such thing as wasted time of said the time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time something to that is coming from the internet butwhen I was 22 after in agriculture market any more and I am telling the listener go abroad MBA I'm just gonna do YouTube now she lied to you guys for 2 years at Old all I'm doing a Startup in improving business when improve the was actually just making videos so what was your mindset during that time it is a temporary Phase I will mess around doing all these things and nothing will work out then you will be forced to go abroadyour MBA and then get a decent job and get on with your life my attitude was that ok you need to mess around fine at if it doesn't work then you go back to the straight and narrow but did not work with starting out a lot of thought I'll be able to do something very sure you are always very confident about everythingwhen you were your first day of school you came back with all your buttons of your shirt gone covered in dirt everything crumpled and I asked you did you enjoy school you said yes it was great fun asked what did you do to day in school you smiled at me and said jhagada means fightif you ever got PO marks then you would then I would ask you why did you do so badly the answer I always got was so you should I see other people's mind it was always that Amitabh Bachchan line that the queue start where I am standing but when did you get confidence about beerbiceps 2-3 years into the processReal world thing happening I am still not sure what is the best place to be but then I don't know anything about this field so I am not the best person to judge all that I know is that ok you are you have died of a study work to do and your owning decent money you be able to pay electricity billyeah but you want to I don't know I am falauli Lambo money can be used to build bigger business I feel so that my current mindset right do you know I do in life are you aware of everything I do in my head it is like kind of an advertising form ok motivational speaking what what what you are doing YouTube why do you think that people watch me for the informationfitness diet health tips and even mental health tips so all of it now if somebody my George somebody like Jose Sadhu was something start saying it then the younger generation wouldn't accept it so when it comes packaged in their language then it's more acceptable Soya I think you are doing a good thing in society use when did you think thatpoint happened like when did you get a little more comfortable with whatever you think is a clearly remember after Virat joint and after returning money based all I knew was how to sign a chequetypes of cheques there are I have no clue about the kind of investments one should make taxes one should pay basically my father or somebody looked after all my fine I would just sign on the dotted line I didn't want my son to be in the same situation I wanted them to have some formal training where if you want to set up business he knows what to do and what not to do in your generation got that formula I think your generation got the formal training fromMBA colleges are generation get it from the internet that concept was not there that you can also get trained from the net with what I am trying to give forward through Hindi channel So English and deep stuff like this and Hindi channel is much more financial knowledge and listen to your parents are stressing you learnt from here but you know this will help you in life like this casual actually put money in your pocket going forward and also the meat is ladkibataen Online mein Hindi me for ladki Kaise pataeye video so it has to be useful it has to be fun to be interesting if it's all the time useful does not form thenso your all three things so that good is actually a whole group of fighting Indian youngsters called in cells by Avon Indians in cell is involuntary celebrate so a lot of Indian guys I either brought up not having had the talk with the parents as a sex education with their parents with something appreciate what you will come to that was I remember you having the talking me the nine year old but allotment don't get that therefore the grower either Patangopposite sex on a pedestal are really looking down on the opposite sex and as a whole bunch of Indian kids especially on the internet right now who's really look down on women and women as like a really negative aspect of of life as in relationship teasing relationships things like floating they think it's like a very dark things to do when you should only be all about career I will erase a face for only we know about you but you have to balance out the human experience a big part of human experience is talking to wintalking to girls and with no parent and you should have the intent of spoiling someone's life or just being in casual situations of using basic Principles are the same but when you talk to anybody to make them interested in you or to build of friendship and all those principles don't change it is a woman or a man out those principles of how to impress a person everywherepercent so I do want to talk about your this gynaecology aspect of bringing your dining hall just I remember I was in a boys only School till 4th standard and 15 September Loko at school and one of the weapons you gave me before I went was a listen you need to know about sex education in general I was very young when you're having a talk with me a Ranbir explain the very gynaecological veyuru diagrams for me and you explain the worldimportant in the kids are bringing to grow up with a very normal aspect of that was not how it happened After you went to a co-ed school girl teasing you are you don't know anything about our babies born and then your sister told me don't you think you should try to givewhich I had been doing in schools for me it was just like it all in a day's work but it was very important for me because I grow up to the very normal concept of periods PC OS from the sex problem women also in this ok their human being with one difference you don't grow up looking women as open D O Ladki you don't grow up like that you grew up with a very ok that lady and 110 2ndticket from you and grammar from you both with a ticket with good manners and grammar I remember that when I was a kid and fire walked through the door before you are my sister Akanksha you'd always like say you slap me and there are no no you let the lady walk for this and that time I get like that I love you what and I love it when you tell me but somewhere a lesson slipped into my head really deeply that lesson be very polite gentle with ladieslater on in life when I started doing this in my area without thinking too much about it would really appreciate about gentleman you are so polite then it made sense sorry I don't on the outside of thechild water not it's also partly safety or you little lady walk in front of you so that no one you know message with her from behind this is partly safety and partly manners as a man who you'd like to fall in love with you think that this my deepmind and living together engine just what you are doing my best that you should be the bestDiaries that is all what about knowledge or experience I could pass on to both my children my daughter's I think you achieve that goal mama at this stage of my life and mygrowing up government to good school after that you went to college of medicine in YouTube videos people at pointing out the new English is really nice and knowledge questions for the people and you got the increase was as what we grew up speaking and Adam Eve correcting a lord my grammar use to bother me when I was a kid and other purpose in the same mistakes to irritate you back but as a kid I rememberend of mentally fighting with you a lot about once when you are very little and we had gone to Kashmir to Vaishno Mata so there was a the server was giving us food and you went up to him and in the typical Bombay Hindi to mere liye kya Laya and his four kids such good Hindi beta ji aap kya khaoge and I was very embarrassedset that I have to teach this boy to speak so I started speaking to you in good English and your grandparents who spoke to you in good Hindi so that you picked up the essentials of boththere is a defect of that but again coming to the English did you everything my English was bad when I was growing up I was in very impressed with your writing abilities but you used to spend a lot of time on the net and also used to see a lot of American shows a Cartoon Network the WWE so you knew more of modern colloquial Englishwhy did probably and with the right pronunciations so I think your call generation is different from as we learn from our English teachers handbook but we need to the right pronunciation so anything like when we used to read our used to call it Enid Blyton and we use to collect Marenge do we know it was morantel we learn French for all your learn from the beginning the correct pronunciationawaiting your loan by reading so you knew everything the visual audio and you had tried every time I was a kid I don't know what you have never saw television like that was Dragon Ball Z or even the way to break down the edits of everything I was seen like that had to enjoy about television like this cartoon Samurai Jack so I remember watching that I discuss it with thisvery good for teachers your lot video editing and you remember when in like fourth or fifth standard actually edited a Dragon Ball Z video mein Chhod Do please little videos and all and I thought Kitna accha computer mein Jagah did you did you think I didn't think the YouTuberead me you are very keen on going into films and I remember at to really polio back caused by openion of films was everybody there is a potted but it's unpredictableyou may be very good in your work you my work hard but still you may never on money and whereas if you work hard at Engineering or at medicine you are definitely going to earn some money and what do you think of a youtubers Entrepreneur who probably you know do men have clueless don't know where it's all going whether it's going to be very big but I remember you telling me when I wasyou that please do your head BA please you happy that if you go into the tested or tried area you RD behind everyone so you told me that I want to go into a field where people haven't been before so that I can be the leader of the Pack I thought that was very smart so I went with itI always knew that you had a business brain there was this apple you this story before that when when you are the 5th standard or something of 4th standard or even earlier your love your school had an event where every child had to get something to Summit able to sell and then like a canteenthe moment and the food that all the kids so you had analysed everything very well you told me that the product that will sell the most everyone always by Samosa so let's make samosa so you have done your market research then you wanted to quality control you are not sure I could make the best Samosa you told me to make it first timetweet it and then that ok she can really make a good Samosa then you said that ok let's give some incentive so he said that I have seen that people always buy when the some free think there so we put a small sweet it doesn't have to be very expensive and budgeting yes and then you told me what do you think the cost will be of so many Samosa so therefore we will charge so much and you didn't want toso high that people wouldn't buy and you didn't want to price is so low that we would lose money a good pricing and yes we were a sell out so that time I realise that this is some business brain that was coming my family and I was never going to force you to do medicine I said ok let him do whatever he chooses but probably go into some kind of a business the issue with doingafter college and all my friends are also study for MBA exam 22 if you are going for the job it is very nervous that one can do is not doing these things fighting as to process all that with the nerves and angst and refractory go Seoul devices with the very angry very angsty lots of abuse 12 like you wrote The Throne and out in the like the world but I feel over time but I found my feed an industry have an amazing time right nowpeople working at Mangi settle down every kam about where things are going so what do you think at three things I did write in beerbiceps car journey and what are you doing the things I did wrong with a lot of kids watch this and think that ok Matt Ryan alternative career as a parent what do you think three things and write three things that they don't even when you are in Engineering school first of all you never wanted to go to Engineering school but I took an opinion from my cousins andmanagement teachers and they all said that let him do Engineering only because it will help him in problem solving later I don't know what is problem solving what problems are going to learn to solve but but but I thought that ok if these are people who are in the business they say so so I photo and you had the marks you had of Physics and Math brain so I sent it would be wasted if you are getting intoearring school with ease and you left it that is the only reason I made you but even in Engineering school you didn't stick to that you are doing three other jobs your some internet I will start of train no so you did 3 jobs while you were doing Engineering school and so when youbhai sahab you had a good idea of what you want to do with life you wanted something related to fitness and you want to go about marketing it so you basically started the whole thing as a way to get to marketing of fitness related product so that was one thing you you had the experience that you are always interested in physical fitness in schoolyou are so young as I think second and you wanted to go for karate classes which again had not let you eventually you did your Judo classes and everything so you are always interested in fitness but sosticking to your core competency which was fitness so that was right about devices and the third thing is what I said that it was like a new thing a new game which you were ahead of the Pack three things which I think you did write better use of this and I don't think I am qualified to comment from whatever you seeI just feel that even if you did like courses you know on the net or something about taxation about market research about communication you know then it would have helped ever wasted so knowing all this would help me be investing money all these things are a bit setyou again that knowledge channel and so talking bad start due angle in me because there was a lot you yes I think but later when you want to have a meditating and all you come down ok Nau I will tell you three things you did right as a parent OK so the first thing you do it right was addedyour colleges still wasn't sure what I wanted to do and I had learnt cooking for the sake of my fitness was awarded Fun Food cooking I really like I thought to myself and I came to understand I think I want to this and that why I have found out the school you are to go to to study and this of Engineering and you didn't even one second say that O my God what are you doing you looked at how much passion and when you like ok fine if you think you arethen go for it the importance of ok wait now you've given me permission to not doing MBA non venomous again think of the other thing the second thing you did right was not give me much money initially both you and appa like golden give me any money very consciously or if you need it very well I will give you but try not to take it should have been locked and therefore immediately after college as it training people to make money as a very important learning experience because we do come from a privilege backgroundlot of friends are grown up with even today they don't have a perspective on money like for them even 3000 4000 rupees is really not that much a train travelling in like a third class compartment the travel bag compartment of trains and you only traveling to like Andheri from the other for 300 400 rupees a lot of perspective on that 3000 4000 rupees remember in Engineering College would spend a lot of money or drink food your likes on Saturday Sunday the order Lordand the bill would easily Run 202011 very casual for me because it's finally had the money to spend but when is it raining the rear perspective on what it takes to earn that 2000 rupees and address of this happening and you will show your face is liquid at least learning about life so you let it contain you so when you saw me my struggle you let me contained on the circle with the hand of their unique but try going keep going and third thing you didright ok after third thing was probably give me a lot of drive and positivity when I was a kid going way back due to instances from the time I was a kid to the first instances when I was in 2nd standard used to ensure that they participated in singing competitions and poetry competition the one singing competition your train where is really when you used to love doing all that I should have the spotlight on me I feel love that but you Hisar trainlate at night at 10 p.m. abhi washing do you pick me up chalo let sing together and you teach me the song competition take part in the annual day not on the day of the competition admin leave a like Hanuman you never knew your own strengths so it was always how will I learn such a big thing and then I would have to remind you that you know the biceps size of every W W E wrestling even number is that you can surely memoryjust needed a little push and somethingset an the crowd in geography locate and right before the competition came up to your house on stage for the parents of you came up in the dual only win cigarette using well and when the announcing that you are one visualizer the polity 18 think that you only 14 square and I send without any expectation OK Google what my mum taught me a do this when you went away that shit my mum isn't like in the cloud does it feel really hollow attached in a still am but like as a kidannouncing the winners of things playing in my head of any two visualizer new visualizer tutorial visualisation and IV price this third prize this second price this and 10 people left out of one of the many mummy ne bola mummy andthat's one thing that I give you a flip side also the flip side is in 6th standard on seventh Judo competition which has prepped for lot was my first ever Judo competition eventually became Bombay champion just completed and a very intense hate people who are physically wrestle with other casual way bigger than you stronger than you technically gifted than you and I went for competition and out of 4 people I came forthand I hated being a loser always had that Alpha mentality is older than me heavier than be stronger than me more technically if I lost badly and I remember I held in my tears like till like my mum came away with my mum to come to the when you take me up then you're driving the car and make eyebrows and I don't like this feelingand you didn't tell me the O baby you know you it's ok next time you will win you told me a straight for the elite listen you gotta work for it harder next year and that's it like that that's the only truth you need to know so I knew that if you want to get ahead in life you have to aim for that everything you want to know how to practice and what can doing well so that is what I wanted you to know if you want something work for itJordan documentary on Netflix and he was kind of 30 with his killer Instinct and I feel even I am too some DID little ruthlessness is requiredcutting style nobody is interested in you so you had to walk together the top five or ten so that the girls do that ok you are the brain if you want them that what was some things in the whole face was growing up to something I didn't tell me like you know that you kept away from your kids to write protect them from certain mentalities at but you did as a mother this is that I have tweeted about the biggestsacrifice for what are the things you can of brought ASAP with without telling us we are doctors we don't have like a factory that is going on producing goods and all so we work hard for money and there are times when you don't have that money so but you don't tell the kids that then also you went to a school with very affluent people so at that point I think when you joythe school we were not we never let your feel it that you are in anyway you know deficient always give the kidney impression that there is plenty and if that isn't that will what can get it so we keep you away from ola money problems the other thing also we keep you away from all disease or anything ok grandmother was not well but we don't tell thethat she is not well and she may not live long as always I remember when you would come from school and she was she had cancer and for metastatic should be sleeping you go and bekar up and tell her that she Mummy I I made this kind of painting whatever silly drawing you are done and she would get up from sleep and smile and you know appreciate everything so you always havesense that ok bye someone to look after me or to appreciate me should be kept everything away from you and the final thing that you keep away that is judgement of a kid so your sister was Shadow very powerful memory Xerox machine she just read anything once so she had anything once she would remember it and she would get all the priceis possible in everything because in our schooling it's mainly memory that counts now your memory is good or better than average but it was not in her class but I never let you feel it that she is so good and you or not you also good so the main thing to tell you was that I know you also brilliant so you do a thing work hard and you will be successfultell the kid becomes that kids in a voice for life was so you give me the us write self confidence on udemy read somewhere that parents main job is to Philip glass up with the kids glass of the so much confidence that no matter how many holes the world Pox in to it you know there is still enough left because there is online hate online trolling everydaykv1 my career will not read my common second heat and never affected areas in one or two times a video call Viral in the Barrage of hate comes on but it only offers me if you read it and then you feel well I am reading my head section if it's like this you know unhappy people who obscuring the sadness but getting spilt on the mum so I were you I kind of feel bad about that he was just my friend mostlysane projector in Jesusan Apparent that affected when I'm not in a good zone about it but sorry about that and we are very sensitive person and doubt this is one of the thoughts that I know he will be affected it that this is going to happen and it has no meaning so just ignore all of it I think I want to but still I am templedo you like a mother protective Instinct I have two mums in my elder sister she does the same on Instagram after every time I just don't replied hate call like I have a team of life 55 people on monkey to do that and they are supposed to problem in some cases but not family is that one and healthy part of YouTube that all this becausehit of all social media event Twitter and all like when you are not actually sitting across from someone you you can say anything about that person you know which would never Sen real life so because there is that interface of a virtual world people are just saying anything about sopeople around me to talk so during coronavirus basically that crisis situations bring out the true nature of a person to HR asking for the same what am I like to live outside of YouTubeat your ok with doing even the humble jobs jhadu pochha everything chopping vegetables doing shopping everything the good is also that you are come if it's not good or things are dirty you don't let me come fast it's also that you arrange things that ok you don't have this weekBadi we get this done and so so you organise things well so is comfortable for me the bad thing is that you are continuing to work thereso many people at monkey now who can single handle pull the company you know up but for some reason I always take their toll on myself with devices monkey I'm too harsh on myself about know if your the Michael Jordan Lebron that works against me sometimes things I always wanted to tell you that if you very successful it's not all youmany forces at work that make you successful even if you are successful be humble and fear of failure also it's still not all you get there are many circumstances that led to it so don't blame yourself for everything study in Italy and the humble in success it is one thing I always wanted to tell you and the other thing I always wanted to tell you is you can't divide life in two compartments thatI will work for me 30 to 40 I will do this after Age 40 I will retire and enjoy myself no Indians don't think like that we don't even think is Sundays and over it for hours in a day you divide the whole day into that this is what part visiting part this is with family this is Forest family and entertainment this is Forest to an entire day you leave your whole life that we one day at a timefighting that is a better way to live life plan everything your holidays your leisure into a day into a week into a one into a you don't wait till your ex age of why to enjoy yes it is wrong you are like I worked very hard plan 30 no risk no nothing and after that I will retire and do whatever I want doesn't AppleI don't even think I'm going to retire after 30 said no my life yes nobody like that so before you know it you know your old and you are wasted your youth so you have to factor in that Lisa what I told you should be fun it should be interesting and useful life but do you think points you feel thatnormal everyone else is having a good time and all I am working so hard so you need to plan to be a tour to have some fun for everyone tells me that I watch so many sports documentaries like the Last Dancelife and sometimes the determination gets too intense that ensure you receive your able to handle it age but my and that I feel like I'm a slave to my determination and my ambition so even if I don't physical energy my mind and Soul will I pull my body into work and I will call rajasthali modern houses and leg let's go make like 10 videos today it's just I can't I am upset happenspeople who take up unconventional feels because then you have to prove yourself so it you have started something you are a Pioneer so the whole world as told you that you are going to fail that is your doing wrong so you are dubli motivated to succeed in it it is one and if you come from a family of people who have been kind of successful at whatever they do then again you have to live up to certain standardslook down upon so that pushes you further but are you spoke about failure Lil bit before in this podcast only one more story durable story of this tattoo do you remember when you thought I'd probably gonna take my own life do you remember when I failed would you like to tell that story from your eyes because I have spoken about it in my depression video you knew I was having a thing with alcoholism write like that you know I was getting deeper into ahaving talks about listen drinking ok I want to know what are you doing but it came from there were a lot of suicides so it was always there in my head that there is too much pressure on Children and it should not be because eventuallyall these things your marks and all don't count so for much so always at the back of my mind was that you should be stable what you do in yourself cause I wanted you to do well in your studies but the main thing was that you should be stable emotionally at a difficult age breakup breakup I was going to alcoholism due to that breakupalcoholism polite to 3 months of my life and I was stopped study after being naked top-notch student will tell standard I am not talking my 12th grade then go into this column then feeling their Revenge from the heat of the class to the bottle glass and people it all over you basically that was the contacts in that put me into depression and that thing of filling your glass with so much confidence that even if there is a failure it should not matter to you so my hunaim was that at that point when you fail that to tell you that ok this is just a minor you know bump in the road and actually it is those people who fail only in life was really successful letter only studentswe to prove themselves later that the company is strong so the only thing my only him that I was to stabilize you make you feel happy make you feel good and give you some hope for the future 178 tattoos I am I from my mom's is not known that I got the answerGoogle tattoo new back Shiv ji word O my god is so big how to get my life on top of your hearthistory of cancer and the tattoo ink is all ka sanyojan so that point of you I am worried and secondly if you want to do a corporate job when you go with all these tattoo dams it will take away from your chances by the corporate myselfhumility has to be taught to cook at all time I don't think I think I think I think you will be something I value a lot and I consciously flycreative pretend not to be with you always like to need a speakerconfidence is one of my game excise se shit like this by you guys teachers also so much weightcaptivated ladki patane ke tarike but ok actually this is a question sentence by Monk entertainment as an organisation to you because a long-term joke in office which is that when would Run 20 mummy like for any to get married and what kind of girl would suit Ranveer I don't have any boxespit to pit my daughter in law in but whenever anybody is choosing a life partner I feel you should look at three things so basically if the person should be a good person what I always told my daughter's see how he treats the waiters do you know the people who don't matter if you treat that person will then they will treat you well later on in life so how you treat the inconsequential andintellectually you must be at the same level if there is too much difference then it's not going to work and you should want the same things in life goals need to be aligned like what do you mean girls need to be aligned but somebody wants just to have fun or somebody wants us to work all the time and you know on you are not decided about whether you wantSonu these important things should be a line when you should get married when you feel ready when you are financially independent you have a good home to welcome your partner into then it is the right time to get married a lot of peoplehanded compliment with cool and you so ok my last question of the podcast is that cause your gynecologist in UC lot of young mothers keep that aside and not talking about gynaecology and talking about Motherhood and the human aspect of it what would you like to tell young mothers other than your main lesson which is that give the kid confidence and protect the kid other than by young mother need to prepare for it because we go to schoolPhool bhi go to college we learn or trade but nobody teaches us how to be a good parent and their books that is material so as a good idea to prepare for it there is never a good time for a woman to have a baby there are going to be careers at bags her figures going to get affected your health is going to be affected their will be Sleepless nights and so on social life everything emotionthe time she has Fossil for her partner everything is going to get affected so you have to prepare to be a good mother or to prepare it at a time when you know is right career advice or advise you to get the right help you to read up all these things some preparation is required points about Motherhood in general and bopen to advice because advice of older women many times as seen in a very resistant to what the mothers of mother in laws have to say but they speak from Experience so use their experience in bringing up your children don't just Desire everything that because they said it has to be wrong and also be true to who you are Because lot of American box Sanam ideaswork in our culture and Indian your Indian self and then work in those parametersso would you say that that was something that apparently pass on the kids everyone does a parent who does not have a spiritual aspect would pass or no more scientific corian a logical aspect to the kids and parents who believes in all this would pass on that to the kids are all parents consciously or unconsciously do pass on their own experience and ideaschildren during my spirituality stands today duty come to a must admit that you are certainly gone ahead of me you are far more spiritual than I am but in a good way of life as it comes don't overthink everything and don't over analysed do your best and then leave thegone call another BA Michael Jordan in life I hope so I think so that was my mummy Dr Swati link is down below if you want to follow your support and help you

starting on beerbiceps Monk e chat ko hosted by Ranveer allahbadiaViraj Sheth maku found on monkey Monk entertainment monk-e chat a podcast is not your business is not done because I just asked questions about themselves like what is your purpose in Laya not not think anything so will you be talking about ghost stories conspiracy theories business lessons life lessons quantum physics basic anything that value added to an informative podcast episode 1 this is episode 1 whereactually we talk about what monkey does what we have learnt in the world of Business and Academy introducing Viraj to you guys I just wanna give you some background on Mr Viraj Sheth he is my junior from Engineering College he is also my co-founder we just happened to do a little bit of Jugaad work together and eventually today we running an organisation that's about 25-30 people strong he is also genuinely on most powerful people in the Indian YouTube communityu name any big youtuber and chances are that Virat status put money on the duty was stable at the top YouTube talent in India Today news last two years ago in full of Hustle is a brother and we usually fool around or not on today's episode 18 Rai inspiring you guys genuine so to start with the story of entertainmentback to back and have any office working on my dining room so from there we can remove in an office Bhilai 25 people I will happen to like genuine hard work so quickly to give you kaise recap of the story we started off Ranbir was my senior in college andso I just look to them all but okback then and that's how we Gerald and Wizard working a lot of the Lost after college with YouTube and all other kind of this god my own loan with work chapter 1 the story of my life trying to increase the amountagain we read and read the full story about two hours of president in the east side of my college and basically you know was doing it to get a certificate at the end of the day and I didn't want to do it the whole traditional way so I did I just called him up and said I actually don't have any want to call for talk now but you doing something cool in your life with the most accessible person I have right now you can you come down and give it ok to this young kidswhat is the whole situation with YouTube is a genuine doesn't like it can you pursue it as a career any of that technically back then going to get on YouTube back in the day it was interior genuine carry out that I had probably like I think 20000 rupees 30000 rupees in my bank account when I met you Batman and I think with writing the first brand deal beaded of sorts was with this energy drink companyPsalm 23 Instagram pose for 7000 rupees stories for belly like 7000 rupees which I mean at that point felt like a fairly decent amount to me because he was just starting out visit visa start thinking OU you get paid to take a picture and post on social media that school that I had my meeting with Ranveer and Rohit super hybrid up and sold it to me that this is the next big thing in the five useyou will make a lot of money just jump into it this is right when I already had one job offer in hand and applied to insane universities in the US that when this kind of my life and said that you not only switch everything that you are going to do and jump into this you know unknown Territory of media and water talk about what to pagebut both of us Sakshi learn through that difficult face to give you contact how it worked again then is I didn't know that there was a way to reach to the brands right I used to directly reach out to the sea use of each companywhy don't you come to our channel and will be a great fit so I had written thousands of cold emails and just two years back when the whole situation of YouTube marketing was not organised in India so no one knew how do you work with youtubers how do you integrate your content pieces all of that have been so many meetings Where I am clueless how to start off with how to take things forward what would be the right dressing to go with all of that I have learnt overand of time also this and if you really want become big business you try understanding the Waves that are going around in the market we can do waves of money that arising so that's pretty much what we did the wave of money that was falling into this YouTube game and we just got a source of more than its kind of in the right place at the right time getting success in general has a lot to do with being not discourage is enough to take the right stuff but also love pleasewhere it gets to the right place at the right time and you need to Grab that opportunity to make sure that you're riding that we have that's really what we didn't and we just to get called and said that lets go at let's go full-fledged into this was actually doing a job back then when can be said that you know I think we can take this full time and within three months that how we started the whole situation is start working full time on the year so I mean that called up our focus is always focus into bringing more moneyeventually it happened like from that 7000 rupees proposed in the next day we went up to 25000 rupees and gradually kept going up eventually all our friends on YouTube like unit Neha ka Gaurav Bhai from flying beast Dhol notice and listen let's work together and now we need to make the some kind of company formula is it or else it would make sense when I was inused to make calls just do in in my day job like I buy used to go to the washroom and make some calls and Olive and realise this this stuff isn't going to be long lasting right you can be doing to jobs at once so we discuss that your let's let's go with this lets start a company and lets formalizing let's get legal papers done and all of that also andintegral part of the cheapest paint we can find food in the cheapest possible for IT companybut in saying that I think that infrastructure that space give us a very kind of good platform for the complete get launch event Li got like the right people joining monkey God Neelkanth Jhalak Rawal initially was obviously that and this very good peoples are working really hard because of the leader so Viraj is the leader of both the organisation entertainment and here is the hardest working anyoneAsif AVN maternal lives because I mean in Apollo Munich story recently neck part of the story of Viraj grinding Wheels on the same this was texting and use that are the reasons like this is a daily think start his work the moment he wakes up at like 839 a.m. is answering calls recharge of that level will continue working problem leave office at 1 a.m. something 3 a.m. in the morning and all but that's completely notwhat I still feel is you should come in at the right time leave early if your work is done don't just be run the office but they will be certain faces in your life when you you will have to stay back longer to do long I think because when you're starting of right people expect you to have a USB of speed like what is your credibility I can go to 2000 all the people but I am group pic you because you're giving me speed you are taking the border of of me so that's whyyou need to have that leverage in in general that's why it's we do what we do to the skills so I also feel like what work for me anything is definitely hard work in speed but they are using it really works Jugaad this is a very underrated aspect of the gameand learn the game as he was playing at retorted how do you do do it and I mean most of these young so this is a sort of figuring it out that we write everyone every new inspiring se photographer videographer editor a meat has most of these guys are all self-taught and that that's been the whole story of millennials or people are each that you want to be self taught you don't want to be stuck toArun organisations and figure out this stuff yourself so that's how I went and had I realise you know what is the best way to reach to the Agencies what is the best way to reach to brands how can we work with talent at the same time the Talent to something so see from the perspective of youtubers all of us are basically children kids inside and we do need a lot of guidance when it comes to the world of business world YouTube business the world of brand buildingbig brother what we did is we realise that you know let's keep the creative child in these guys active all the Logistic will admin finance work let's moved on to someone else let's keep that burden of to someone else that's how we figured that you know Dhol management and manager aspect came into the picture than at the same time I mean he learnt about this particular business but hebusiness in general light of how to actively growing organisation how to hire the correct people how to get rid of the wrong people on the little things you learn as your doing business in you Lauren podcast don't two books when I sit and listen listen books and his life see what he's done correct and just putting out that completely self-taught I want to ask Viraj my first question of this interview is thisbest aspect of this chapter 31 the most difficult is the hiring part write its extremely difficult to get the right mix of people because a I see a lot of people talking about the fact that there is an employment or there is not enough opportunities in the country in general I think possibly the fact is that a lot of people don't want to Grab onto the opportunities everyone has a very employeegoing forward rights is that I am coming in at 99 leave I want to leave at 6 initially I feel you definitely should not have that attitude because you want to give it your best shot at what you doing you just want to learn you want to keep adding more value because that's when you will get into the eyes of the higher hierarchy that as simple as it is or are you build your own thing you innovate you build business around it this two ways to it but both of these days is a being an entrepreneuraur when you being an entry level job and it is that you need to add value you need to show that your in it your all in it basically what you need to show chapter 4 the rewards and it's been like the higher in the best aspect of this is only the higher the biggest hai to get to meet a lot of Subah accomplished people people who have the expertise the wisdom the knowledge to to do what they were doingnormal people get to access this at a much elder reach I've been lucky enough to Europe iqminds of some genius is like in Radhakrishnan Pillai people were running news organisations is something I feel is the biggest higher get because I can speak to them on a one-to-one basis and see that these are the problems I am facing what is it that you think I should do what is the direction I should be moving and as your mentorstands now how is it different from when you're just started out the one begins when was like a ton of differences but was like the one next after reading the biggest difference I see in myself as I was very on the confident and fairly so because I had achieved anything I didn't know if I was going in the right space in all of that but in general that should not be a factor you should just go and heads of this be this fake it till you make it right that's how it works be confident every time your entering the room make sure thatshit right and that's all that you only value 1 if you value yourself enough value in your learnt enough enough information you can add into the less than their value so Step Up To The pedestal of being a portion of value that the real connection get made and one more crucial that we learn this Delhi Airport and uncle ke Mal ha talking does is suited up you wearing suitswedding suit he tells us that the biggest business of my life business in India is made to emotional connection so I think that something is also figured out in our industry you want make money in life you first become peoples friend in the world of Indian business you make your business connections and money will follow at the same time be a person of value so that in those connections want to be your friend so good that way bill loginour core value of the company is also been right even when you're working with talents you're working with brands we make sure that we understand what is it they want before getting all the paperwork done getting them sign all of that lets her country we need to understand abhi connecting with the individual in the first place I will be equipped enough to add value to their lives what is the biggest challenge of problem the facing the again like Gary vs as and I don't mean to sound to make a sound wave equation empathy super important when it comes to business rightneed to make sure you're not in it to be a shark only just you know that to add value to collaborate and that's how you will grow with them with monkey up to now brobegin the company and it alone in the world know he is the king of this organisation I am primarily in charge of culture mental the people who join in The Monk entertainment overall eyesight Strategies for where the organisation is headed but if someone asks me OK Google what are the activities and containment dost I'll always wait speak to Viraj this is on the move about these things so Viraj wantRaymond to how we been able to create your own office of the poem 5:30 kids how is it is again we realise that we were already working with talents now we're adding value both monetary brandwise all of that then we realise that there is a gap it's not just the Talent who don't understand how to work with brands but it also is the brands who don't understand how do work with youtubers that they don't know what are the right creators to work with the donorspend it on the market which of these guys they don't know what platforms to leverage a lot of brands are not digitally equipped as yet they don't know how what is a swipe up stories I don't know how to use a hashtag in a tweet like people are is no these things better because we were the generation that grown up with all those around us a part of our daily life smart phone 3 apps that you've downloaded essentiallyFacebook Instagram and Twitter or on Snapchat to be no be used on a daily so naturally we know how this works a lot of the elder people are people were running organisations who was CM of c-x shows in these companies in not so well was with because I don't use it on a daily right to conduct thought what we do is we work with friends to help them understand how to work with talent vocal talents to make them understand how we can work with brands and in all of this weekso basically do everything else that comes on digital like social media management video production everything content related is what Monk entertainment looks at so that all of it can can Commando One Umbrella tomorrow is a brand comes to me and said that I have X amount you spend on content I can tell them ok visa the talents you should women be the platform you should work on this is the branded content you should make beyond using influencer and this is how you should maintain your sourceand we can do all of that this is like a 16 this so also a lot of your mind be looking at this video is about how to go all these things about once every time it began just for influencer marketing in Indiathis business tourism when you like you know I get it on the Internet and newspapers and all of them make sure you read through the lines because a lot of the time these figures abe looted that X company got 100 billion valuation are 1 billion dollar valuation all of that is all right you need to see that what is the company's core problem solving agenda livethe problem solving ola at the end of the day takes you from point a to point B so they are making sure that they solve your problem of travelling air bnb is making travel fun like they are giving you an experience for example what is it that we do we make sure that Agencies or brands lizomed is your by being the one stop solution in terms of digital solutions that's what the model is now how do you scale of from that is you build team around it you networkwork with more brands we will recommend you to other brands your work speaks at the end of the day that's really all seven you ok now you see me and containment going not fayde aur sunao sunaohappen if the if the purpose and the agenda of the companies in the right direction right if you are all in it just for money it will be a Shallow person if you are in it to figure out that you solving a problem for adding something to an opposite party that's when the company will sustain and that's when the company will have a sort of a correct approach to to what they are doing so I feel I mean as Nexus it would be to work with more clientsto work with more talents and 2 in general expander team so that we can open much more verticals in general talking I don't know what I am busy as a strategy of mentoring of the way I look at it on a very personal level is that I feel that ok now today is 25 young kids working in this organisation or not supporting their own families or that's where I get my motivation from that way to know our hard work is creatingincome for so many families and going forward we always have a dream of going after 2000 Rs 20,000 Hai was at some point and each of a core people in office will become leaders going forward so creating creating way more employment and overall adding a lot of money to the Indian business space that I am personally I mean I am extremely patriotic to this fact that I want to add much more revenue to the whole Indian Ecoeven though I had you know why was all set to apply for my Masters and all of that but I am sort of had this reckoning recently where I know that you know creating employment or creating opportunities being your in the country itself you doing a great Sword of service to the nation and not all of us can go to the front facing borderline and facing bullets and all of that but we can all do of BITS in a way to help our countryshakya 25 your goal but as of now what's your most difficult challenge on a personal level in terms of business person I have in the business is that this ensuring consistency right after you doing a similar job for a six-month period to you right it at the end of the day still becomes monotonous no matter how much you love it so you need to understand how is it that you can do things differently what is it that youto be crowned to make sure that this is something new is this something fresh that you bring you onto the table ring that always remains to be the biggest challenge how do you keep yourself entertained while getting the work done what's caring about working right now I got the start of what's the one thing that you feel I am not feeling anything at the moment specifically but I feel at the end of the day that kick when you start off when you are 80 ride that should always sustain in your mindif you start getting completion twin things are going in your favourite eventually as the end of it I just need to be blessed with the feeling I had when I just started out you know I want to be on my toes sticking all the time I don't want any complacency in my behaviour or in my approach that is what will keep me going in a longer run and knowing him I'm pretty sure that he will be able to maintain that like if if two years and lega massive officespace indispensable around the school in spoiler I'm pretty sure is Morgan gets spoilt going forward as well chapter 9 love story that go back to Engineering College why we first met what was your first impression of working with me and what value during I have added to live score for you to explain the value of a co-founder to the general publicwe should either involved three things one is either the good with text to have a great network of 3 is a putting in some cash on table right so technically speaking the II two things that the last two things that we mentioned was a good with boxes kickboxing for you you brought in the initial capital you know that we could leverage on that started values wise I think one thing I learnt bit time fromwhere is that even though he comes off from from a fairly well of family he made sure he want to make his own name in the space his been there at Juhu beach at Carter road all of that this distributing pamphlets to people to subscribe to it and I don't know how many people know this but he is win travelling in train day in day out I I know this is a very common thing to do in Bombay but this side of face when he was facing your depression right but he still kept goinglike about him he doesn't complain too much he is all about like going for it what is the next problem solving how are we solving it is not about what is the problem and why is the problem is about what can we do about it is the biggest thing I learnt from here and also co-founded always kind of have any effect on the whole organisation or organisation that if that wasn't like discipline from this like all aspects of life andmaybe I work hard and execute one day was a long distance of lacking from my life with youcompatible with which selecting it is kinda like a marriage and one other crucial thing about marrying someone in business in that your goals in the long term it via line like if one guy just wants to earn money and Reliance Industries that song and work out both into 100 and goal should be again should be the same here it doesn't matter what is thethat's been taken by the user will be multiple disagreement thing like with this any relationship in at work unit understand that if you are having these agreements it because both of you think that this is the best way forward for both of us together we both have the best interest in our mind is just think in different parts and understanding and then come to a conclusion on one of the two Road 3rd Roadand you need to have that your relationship with your founder because if it's a very yes man relationship is not value to either one of you need to make sure that both of you are thinking and usually so that the best outcomes onto the table and then we go for so anyway guys that was only one inlet into Monk entertainment what can really requesting knowledge that all kind of supporters on a next venjo which is The Monk entertainment social media handles for basically trying to create an education that for youwe teach all business from our perspective to the members of monk entertainment themselves will be creating videos will be talking about along the questions that you guys have in your head so first go and follow that page on LinkedIn download Instagram page second officer good for Mr Shades handles and all of them down below and Virat one last message for anyone watching this point because of this is the water at this point the intrigued by the concept of successjust make sure that you get things started and you keep at it was the most important be consistent I have in the last two yours not even look back and see near ki kya chal raha hai Jiski building this have an overarching long division of what you're doing but just keep one day at a time one day at a time and I am just getting started for anyone who is even slightly looking up to me trust me I am just getting started I am learning everydayand all the work that we're doing together right it's not a 1% of baby want to book so I think at the end of the day it's all about execution is about doing the groundwork get to the ground and keep executing keep doing stuff because I know a lot of people who just like to think and not do after a point analysis becomes paralysis of sorts also again don't be negative about things we see in really dark days and something in thisgenuine felt like this company is now can work out in god we have discussed but things eventually worked out when you put on his hard work in two processes so that his message this is my messages well and adolescents from broadsheet and Ranbir"

good for sure you feel ki 0 people should make more of this kind of colleges AP movies in Hindi Bollywood one had in fact on you and meworld as a young audience but definitely be expected this from ghost stories on Netflix per Nahin hua hai I am not going to talk about itgot into Christopher Nolan Explorer Hollister us and v one I would probably se Shutter Island that got me into the director Martin ScorseseSohila it does my lord mindfucking thatDil Chahta Hai it teaches you to look at life in a different for you bro the same thing that five movie Bollywood Hollywood yah that are fully like impact due in terms of your who are today Yeh does movies of decade or so it's my medical se Hollywood movies come Aati Hai hamen bhi nahin aati because it was so the one movie that really changed my lifeok akshy Kumar ki ful movie and how it blended horror and comedy and I fell in love with him I was a fan of that has to be that one movie on other movie Bollywood would say is probably Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara ok because different filmby the time Jab Singham Jaisi movies aa rahi thi came up with a movie about friends going on a road trip to road trip Kisi Ne attend Nahin can you fall in love with me andtabhi posting karna on Star Plus for reviewing movies 3movies again I would come to say interstellar the force of the scale because the plot the way the plot was written and do so complicated and you know cooling that of and Christopher Nolan you like engineerpink shade of was like of the roof Manan and and also one more movie that really impact admin 3 Idiots the reason being treated for that one movie I feel like the youth now on Kauwa contact name is Bollywood mein jo you know Hona chahie that touches them and it was at one movie that touched them a lot to basically our audiences what you mean your audiencecountry we want to get is love stories and we get all of that thing but that was that one movie that you know bulb cement the fact that Rajkumar Rani is one of the most brilliant directors of our country and the way if its artistic film is a commercial movie get it so beautiful and you know the message that it had everything every frame was made with loveI was your follow your and funny moments like I nevermotion that got hit you rightI know the short route crime story nice follow you back in the day but what do people not know so that this is and one thing not to sound like this but because I have a rich family a lot of people say that I have not worked hard and they described my work may be there are some people who do that but it sounds are you know inches me because it is 1 by mistake does I was born in which member of course I would say this I wouldagree that yes I had much more benefits were a lot of people and I completely embrace it but I had my own you know that shapes and struggle but yeah they were times but if I would have been in a family that was middle class or was not rich was poor I would have the same that I like to work hard for my own self creating my own identity and reaching like what I want and I don't believe inI believe in what my heart says what my gut says this is this one thing that people you know think ki nahin usko sab Hath Mein Mila yes that you know was hard and was a long route but it worked out and I'm really proud of what was the worst part of that was for you struggle on the worst part aboutbut Kuchh madam aisa hota hai na ki Kabhi ka bhi matlab aap jante ho and aapane Dil Se Kuchh mehnat Ki Hai aapane Apna hard work passion lagaya hai and use chij ka great Jyada kis baat to Paisa Hai yah to ho gaya na kya baat haiDur Gaya ismein ki India mein jitne bhi theatre and I got that I struggle to create your own identity is what is like that part like I'm happy that I am so luckyborn into this family have a wonderful mom-dad and yes I had a good comfortable life but a part of me also has worked hard and created a separate identity for myself which I'm really proud of variable on YouTube also ki Yahan to watch your next step when you look at YouTube bro abhi kaisa Ho Gaya Na chal Ranveer to mere ko batao like you like growing and changing why did you changeas a creative I also need to keep myself entertain your actual real life mein ho raha hai wahi I think you to create something like that but as what types of youngthis content is what is happening somewhere I want my audience to embrace that is something different and you know it is a little difficult but you have to keep them entertained that they my audience is like God to me I would do whatever they want but I also want them to like have a conversation with me I don't want to have a conversation with them and tell them Ki Main poochh water two or three directionslike this II II II II II II II III directions and makeup feature films you know that tells a story that has emotions in its not like melodrama emotion emotion that touch people second the direction ago and is the thriller the dark and the mind bending direction which I want to see how to make people see the very Other Side Of Me what I have in my mind I have made this one video call The stranger in the plot is a little childbut otherwise directed upon my heart and soul and people like it my audience they accepted my dues Nahin Honge because of the fact you comedy comedy offcourse Jyada Chalti Hai but so something on that front you like directing in a very different manner bringing a narrative and I thought direction as to be Ki Main usmein Nahin Fir Bhi Mere Naam Hue vah chij chal rahi hai that is the direction I also want to take any business mindsetI would feel like I want to I don't want to be the star of the face of that we direct most underrated directors in this but if someone is from a filmmaking perspective I know you decided camera angles you decide what happens in the frame hi do it is a instinctJattu Video dekh raha hai bro hundred percent and also anything I watch with cinema in movies as a youtuber now you tend to break downidhar se an audience you feel ki people look at me and they think and I personally also prefer watching Englishjust because that's my life experienceso honestly a lot of times when I am watching se my own videos I feel that yaar I know that people enjoying this is not hundred percent the content I want to me but you have to something scary audition I know you also feels like you be a part of you will enjoy your own video to make that thing you've grown up watchingKisi Ko Dekhkarwhat is one crazy story about Nolan basically years so insanely and to attention to detail that a hill get three four options for each shot go through each shot 315 hours after the whole production of the movie is done he spends a lot of time studying s34 option and he rides on notes for every second Kyon 20 second the cloud should be atso much so much distance from the bottom of the screen and from the side of the screen doesn't x and y axis for every frame how is that much attention to details in to so much that you'll even interested in creating content available so again because of my real life I study all over the world of yoga people think it's all these are some other meditators it's not that but the actual world of yoga talks a lot about science fiction the things we see about time travelthe end of Windows to tell me the end of the maze of basic kind of idea of what you and it only goes in one direction what turns and goes in the other direction OK Life In 2D X and Y no human being I can walk in front I can work on the side and I can jump 53gold height length absolutely now and and when it living Ho live in 2D in doesn't even understand the concept of 3D straight line it doesn't understand what thewalking around it becomes very Flash tool of you blue Air on and it doesn't Axis Bank so same way you means can't perceive four-dimensional features matlab around us there are four dimensional creatures which is exactly what is an interest in the endinterstellar the show Matthew mcconaughey has become a four dimensional creature and he is talking to his daughter because 4 dimension actually mean what means that you can go a long time also has an accident you can go back in time can go to 1818 good in 1993 and talk to the people in 1900I like it is coming now so ready definitelytell you what's Satya the head of YouTube India spoken to me about what I do some people infotainment matlab at IIT information on a also entertained at the same time ok if I am teachingmensfashion real life skills teaching farming YouTubebecause 60% of India has got internet now 40% has left the 40% that left is actually very low income they will want YouTube because of that reason I ask you in the future of comedy on

everyone that affected me wrong I did I did analyse a lot of stuff onwhat went wrong the first thing that went wrong that I couldn't understand cricket the way people look that I made the video on am generally telling this on camera I am also human so I am like I think she'd Mujhse vo Galti HO and I think that was jyada ho gaya over use ho gaya same joke and it got a bit exaggerate again I really enjoyed this video I don't think it deserves the hate it gothot but it had a lot of fit me so there's a lot of listeners who listen to this possibly I'm not come across the channel on YouTube audience and there they might be wondering why I am asking Ashish so much about just one radio am asking to break dance video honestly if you attach the name Ashish chanchlani as an SEO tags on YouTube to anyway it's like a nationally known hack and it's so blessed are youis true when you are saying is everything order a lot of people like I know for a fact they kind of bet on US like the race of keyboard Ashish chanchlani video undertake of that one secondly I know that we are you Divas hinduon through brand money so there is a little brand pressure brands rely on US Ok Please generate view JNU for the vs so there is pressure on YouTube for shops feeling pressure right now life about all these things all the stuff that saidsee you know I've always sleep pressurise matlab hota haieverything you are here because of the content you created you are not a star people like your content it's entertaining reaching them don't take it for granted that is what my month HashmiI think about you that you've actually around your name you build one full ecosystem in the whole team is also come up because of this Yeh how do you feel about that the you are the centre of the Holy Cross that people call this the Ashish chanchlani system that I know you feel happy and you know you feel grateful I know those things will you be describedfirst of all like I'm really happy that I have this wonderful team around me if they need to introduce little bit and give the listeners some perspective I am basically Ashish Esteem which is a lot of friends family cousins all begin YouTube channel that have taken of which are very successful now bands on board and a lot of times I am talking from a monk entertainment with pictures from brand for the whole ecosystem everyone elsedo you know in Basketball or sometimes a 5% team is one guy who like Karen the team obesity are the four contribute a lot and they play their own It All In One guidemake a YouTube channel I got knows maybe one day they can I hope the very funny but Jadu is like release funny guy like when we have met a molecule that I will realise is really funny I can become a content head at somewhere to everyone to seal it is generally talented people say ki AshishAnmol was a fan of the fan of mine and contacted me and today is working with me this is why Rohit is lives in my city he was my family contact me this people around me and I'm really proud of them feel I am so happy to see them growing but the fact that they get the tag because of mebattery belt of keep telling them this eyeshadow branch out and become something of a good trait of making peopleyeah it like a I want to ask about this is something I was also you know ok definitely your content you are acting your brand building all that on one side and this is one x factor of behind the scenes ok now you befriended reply Sahid I am your boyfriend a lot of directors and producers well what has worked for you in that friendship other than your YouTube numbers were reviewed and sociallyAsif all my my my really wacky sense of humour that has worked really well because many Dekha Hai Ki Main Itna Bada Achcha Chhora hun kar rahe main and Mujhe Har Koi Ke Samne Mat Bhul Gaya Hai Ki Haithe one thing has been myself I got myself also I've realised this directors are not what their perceived as I recently met a very big that I would not name naam nahi Lunga butHanuman ko Jindagi Sikh de rahe hain this was like you know what I think there is no like formula and what about all those negative people you meet in industry I know you are also the kind of guy friend you can spot people who just nice for the sake of being nice or you have a mass call when I talk to youthere are a lot of people are mask especially the need and how do you deal with thatmere sath kya ho raha hai you just stay away from you so if it's like this is person coming to me and negativitypeople in the media that of very fake very fit and they looked down upon you just because of the way you speak the mannerisms you have are what you eat and where you come from which is really stupid as well it is really stupid and because the world is evolving people getting work of cost and as the world is evolving and evolving every allies like Jitna aap khud bolna gens it will get you to moreother than you behaving and you know keeping the certificates I have one theory and his thoda tell me a lot of youtubers that we see today many of the fade away in the next five years and I'll say that because I am not in a negative way not think the real khatm ho jayegi people will find other things and leave maybe maybe some Divas Carriers will feed me also not find workwhat do you say about that I agree with you and for that for them to be there and not fade away I would just say they need to update with what happening around vehement yes reinvent and give something different you have to take risks for the fruitEk bhi Pal ho jana Ek aapke liye Shor ke barabar hote hain people to do and I completely agree with you and I feel that they were so talented but the carrier's didn't equal to me and I would say better than me and followers and numbers and of course Marshalbut I would say never took off because of the fact that never updated with what was going around repetitive what did you update like to change first of all of my house man is just not to attendbasically my name is more in the slapstick zone but sometimes have to go in one that's the copy that's black comedy blue comedy sarcastic dry humour lot of stuff you cannot take on which I kept updating sim Mere videos of humour and the subsequent some ways to my Instagram ke Chhote videos have tried that and artistic satisfaction with this is the engineering student inside you becamebroke down Singh yes it did a lot a lot of the alot of part of me that I should only look down on Engineering College right after trq team building editing video creation interviews I look at it from an engineering perspective of a breakdown for example you know when you are in Engineering college if you takenjust typed the letter A for that a to appear on the computer full mechanism that go inside the computer as an Electric impulse has gone from the keyboard to the microprocessor the microprocessor is digested it and then something happened 11 years come out how is the pixels and become black instead of white know that's what is going to reduce the one told me a simple thing so deeply and I feel like I break not every thing and itbecome faster in the edit room your problem solving ability becomes better Android feel to grow any business you have the ability to break down things and understanding that feel is what you have done also revealed to be Akshay family se I like you think youjo ghar per mila tha aapkomere ko ek bhi subject ka naam yaar again coming back to that face way you broke down your humour but one thing you did you are used to watch Vines a lot of very dark at that point was very dark and that's why is still water logging contact because I can spot adaptor is a film you have told this to me and I allfeel that you didn't try different comedy you upgrade you I could you brought an actor's but every stage of this bro so right now what have you and lies about what to do next where is engineering mind working for Kariyo my engineering mind for my career is is in working in the fact that you know it presentation Lene to teacher of quickly grade Legawhat is audience and taking names yes there are a lot of mistakes in a lot of content that I feel but the same goes for me as well which I am not awarewhich they might have spotted an audience was spotted a lot of mistakes errors not technically but as a as a script point of you are bro writing format is very hard as a difficult and sometimes I feel a lot of youtubers out there comedians don't improvise and it looks forcedlook like make joke marunga and Maggi dialogue which should not be the case for me I am not like the owner of this world of the skills that you have to play out ofprice the audience don't follow formula formulas and thought process about creativity in that face matlab Euro when you release the video and it really well then there is a need a pressure of what to do next did you have a rider spell is this is no no II just went on the gut feeling and when this wave came now you are so confidentwhat was going on in your head when you sleep that one will not this is what I want toanyway Gender and sex office ke upar bhi Kuchh Achcha Nahin bol raha hun but still we can advise for all those and what you are advice for young youtubers going forward and young content creators to get YouTube don't be afraid to take risksone thing about se second please please be updated what's happening around you please is Baat Ka Dhyan Rakho ki aapke around aapke world cup comedy how people are evolving what people are liking you can't just sticking to one formula because you think is getting me lose their third I would say patients is very important the reason being you can't become like you need to work hard for everything ifagar aap ka ek video Ek time per aapko Itni bhi nahin Karega video for that to happen give your hundred percent and The Fourth most important don't keep expectations from yourself if you want keep expectations from yourself you will be happy and will be happy will create a better content that is what I feel the same goes for the audience like if you surprised the audience of the content that they did not expect they enjoyed even more so keep a surprise forFaisal Faisal surprise yourself as well I am trying to say but I also would definitely definitely want to talk to you about the business side of YouTube you've got yourself a lot at age 26 yeah so what is the business advice Yoda gives a 22 year old version of yourself 5 pieces of advice and this can be as simple as network more not saying ASAP Axis Pawan Singh all 22 yearsmoney more than what you are managing right now this is what I would like in what way can you know the way that you can even more than don't let that happen with you know your worth that don't let other people and events and evaluate they do that this is undervaluedYouTube Pune don't let that happen and learn to say no this is not to say no don't do it just because someone else's telling telling this to you some because you're pretending this will get you to you to a place that you think because at the end of the day is not comfortable doing that are not comfortable to tell me your projectYeh Mere ko you know paise acche de raha hai yah you know ya mere ko launch Kar Dega learn to say no apni life this is something with white people they had been very open right now kithe time when I was like I used to take things for granted and this is that one thing that I would like to give people other than this was way back like 2221 bolunga main bro I have so like don't take things

of my life was also the most important character building experience of my life if you heard of Oscar this is going to be a great I was a perspective view and if you're not heard by Oscar award I tell you human Civilization has been around for a long time the tell us that it all started only about 4000 5000 years ago modern historians don't believe that modern historians believe that it's been around for like more than 50000-60000 us there was some importantCivilization Indian civilization was one of them the Egyptian civilization was one of them and other very important in shall Civilization which stretches back possibly beyond 50,000 years ago is the Amazonian rainforest Civilization in the same way that we have Ayurved in India the Amazonian Civilization have their own version of Ayurvedic talk about Herbs and plants that are native to the Amazon rainmore than 2 million 3 million species of plants that are already discovered in the Amazonian rainforest and you know what the constantly discovering new species of plants 93 million plants are some human being and I doubt it was a human being I do believe that there was some kind of divine intervention alien intervention of all the plants in the Amazonian rainforest to combine two of them the leaves of one plant the Creepers of wineanother plant you breathe and boil them together and you create a drink like chai like me you consume the drink and imagine that is a spiritual ceremony attached to consuming that bring the someone to guide you through that spiritual experience created by consuming this natural drink that person is called Islam in the culture is called the sharmnak culture the drink was speaking ofOscar is currently being studied by neuroscientists all over the world because of its healing properties keep in mind in this video I am not promoting the use why was I don't want to get the list in the sense that we can do the details have done I was calm myself and we'll be talking about their experience in detail what is also important for you to know that you need to know the backstory of what does it doscientists found out that I was ka have the active compound called dmp what dimethyltryptamine dimethyltryptamine when it crosses the blood-brain barrier when it actually does your mind a lot of IT in break old neural patterns and conform new neural patterns the means imagine your kid to five years old your week some dogs on the roads are chasing you get scared to run away from them then there's a neural pattern that getsin your head and neural pattern explains to your mind at one point in my life with cheese me down the road before associate your own internal field with the concept of dogs you grew up with that knew that on the side of the sky dome the carry your friend's house different dogs extremely friendly bristles care of that dog why because of a neural Pata this is one small instance Imagine The instancesruin your life all these multiple neural patterns are formed in your head I was ka has the capability of destroying so renewal patterns and forming new neural patterns the reason the combination of two plants is because the leaves of that one plant have the active compound of DMD but if you just consume that plant or drink made from the leaves of that plant your stomach acids destroy dmt the creepthe second plant in the drink acv blocks out some of your stomach acids and the active compound of dmt is absorbed by a body and it can reach your brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier after 3 million Amazonian plant how did 7 figure will be combined this one and that one can I be left with I was come nobody knows the Origins of it only thing that people know is that it's been around for a while and that its leaderuse role in the human evolutionary process It helped a lot of people on a spiritual level It helped a lot of people grow into the better version of themselves and in saying that it is not a Wreck relational drug when you think about something like alcohol and marijuana you do the things of fun you do the things for decoration the fund to even something like LSD and rooms are relatively on the move one side and I was your experience is never done for funI was the experience and speaking a someone has done it shouldn't be done by everyone it is an intense experience please understand that what's the story of Engineering College of Nursing podcast with Graham Hancock is considered one of the world's most famous most respected historians is doing podcast with Joe rogan josh groban Speaks a lot but I was on his own podcast Graham Hancockspoke about how is done I was come multiple times and every time is done it had become a better version of a field in some aspect he spoke about how ideally you should do it in the Amazon rainforest you should go to South America and curator and experience for yourself you should find a legitimate Sharman it is a lot of Pariksha means of them there are some negative Vibes associated with the term I was Kaba have been I was the debts which and legitimate Lee I wasthe deaths caused due to those fix problem mix other substances with the I was called I was sell it to sell it to people looking for healing actually cause more harm to them then benefit or right please understand that that's one of the primary reason you shouldn't go out looking for I was come they say that with these sacred plants which are also part of ancient native American culture the plants always find you yougo out searching for those plants are dried and never really believe that was I got it cool whatever Graham Hancock also stressed on the fact that when you try experiencing and I was cut trip when to consume the drink when you consume the group chairman has to be around you he has to guide you through the trip to open a whole new dimension of existence and is very easy to lose your mind completely someone has to guide you through the trip is very important to the processnow she also said the fullest part of the trip is where you'll either puca lot will cry a lot I was a highly acidic substance at the biological aspect of it the decided it's no accident that your stomach feels dhoti Re stomach feels uncomfortable and throws up water was inside the spiritual aspect of throwing up and I was kar is Lat throughout your life you accumulate a lot of physical toxins because of youhabit of eating habits bad recreational habits and more importantly you accumulate a lot of emotional toxins in full experiences from your life experiences that are trapped inside body when you didn't know actually hiding in some corner of your being told you puke out at the toxin release but it is extremely intense usually accompanied by hallucinations podcast and a pretty much forabout it but you later when a bigger and bigger biceps very nervous about my early struggles enough on the spot ka people were saying all kinds of things people telling me not to go down the road of becoming a youtuber is no such career called the social media career and salt lake address voices which were pulling me down and in the middle one day my dad comes up to me and he said that hey you know whatbegin your career lesson plan of final family vacation and go to this place called Seychelles that stage of my life so stressed and so unsure about what I was doing everybody readily went to Seychelles and a standard switch off from the world of early carriers in that country on vacation with my family beautiful thing about my family is a long vacation they let me be by myself I go to my own thing was on the Seychelles beach andconversation with this one person site of a lot of the thing explain what I do basically did my own version of mini podcast with bad guy and he mentioned Islamic culture to explain a certain concept to me to the moon hot Sham week I went back to that Graham Hancock conversation hello crimen acid with me like I was customers and he looks at me and said where you had that would I was CAI told him that you know what this is what I know about it I also know that it's a pretty intense experience is not require additional while it can help you it makes you face Your Worst fears in terms of hallucinations you see the things or scared of the most in your hallucinations and then maybe it becomes a better trip later he looks at me as I don't believe everything you see or read on here on the Internet if you want to know what I was experience it and then comeselected area but for that I'll have to go to south america to experience it right he looks at me and said what if I tell you that I am train Sharman and carrying a Alaska with me and at that moment I realised I was reached out to me I didn't reach out to it and the next moment I thought to myself no no I don't go through scary hallucination that's not my kind of thing that stage of my life I was drinking a lot of alcoholgive me the lord of Cannabis and I thought I am alright I'm ok with this might just need to I don't face my biggest feels that constantly over the next two days and we were just talking about I was Kabir of my all kinds of topics but it only a few crucial things about I was ka he said that that bad aspect of the trip that first difficult part of the trip It doesn't happen to everyone when you consume marijuana alcoholyour body reacts to the substances and then create the high or a state of existence was in your own mind when you can assume I was kam you are consuming a substance that completely alive it's got a soul and identity of its own and also read these books by someone called Carlos castaneda at in the book was called on one by Carlos castanedavery important concept engine cultures from the America's Basti ancient American culture and South American cultures had these nine secret plants that particular plants in particular plant proves to be very important from a spiritual perspective these plants are consumed under the right circumstances could help you grow a lot spiritually but you need the right circumstancesand each of these plants had even think of as a spirit attached to it ok now imagine that you are alone in the room with one other person imagine that it's a man is just you and that man even if you close your eyes and a picture that your brother you know that there's a masculine presence in the room with you feel homemade energy now in your head the same scenario you remove the manwomen sister your mum is suddenly feel feminine energy from talking to you feeling masculine energy through me the guy talking to you listening Romance voice imagine all the women feel a lot of time in energy coming through the screen similarly each of these plants had either masculine or feminine energy is attached to them and when you consume them under the right circumstances you do feel and external presentssay you do it alone with Shamil you feel the presence of the Shamil with you and then you feel the presence of what they call mother iowaska in your hallucination you might feel of feminine presence in the same room as you are it some thing very difficult to explain to let me try breaking it down your photo different people have different times of hallucinations when they do I was ka someone will picture of female lion someone will picture a doll someone willreally scary looking lady will picture a beautiful lady their own version of mother was another plant called peyote it's not runes of magic mushrooms that the different plant but there's a father figure that exist in Association with Autism and people consume the feel a very strong masculine presence as a part of the hallucinations a part of their experience anddisparity speaks of father peo to every single person that does I was the speech of madawaska female presence which kind of sounds scary on the surface level but trust me it was a huge aspect of the river Sky experience and actually made it a lot nicer now Laura sceptics will be listen to the podcast in which drugs are coming from but this is soconditioning all your life you've been told that listen you drink alcohol which is an extremely harmful substance for your body and your mind and your spiritual journey but because we even brought up in a society where it legal you think it's alright similarly a certified Cannabis which is harmful if done access but we less harmful than alcohol that also will niceness it because it clubbed with Other Drugs like cocaine heroin actually extremelyupper body much more harmful than alcohol is without getting into the physiological details of the substance I believe that you should trust 50,000 years of wisdom rather than trusting laws which were made in the last 100 years primarily out of field primary out of political organisations controlling their own citizens telling you need to think like this and if you do this you are bad you are drug addicted doesn't work likelet your own experiences decide your own opinions story explained that I was experience would be very individualistic so what I read online was again specific to those individuals what I would go through in the I was the experience would probably be very very different so that got me thinking I honestly didn't know what direction I should go andalso happen to be the same day that I went to my first ever deep sea divers like the one they do in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara with your Scuba Diving equipment and guided I've basically someone held my hand but took me really Di wedding event 36 feet deep underwater solve wale on my first dive asol underwater gold shops near me and opened up my perspectives in our deep sea divers starts to sit at the edge of the boat and the needle YouTubefall off the edge you need to trust the water will just support you for your kind of scared because your kind of falling into an open Ocean far away from the land is just go with it fall backwards land in the ocean look under Neet you are the colourful fish you able to see all those colours and all those experiences because you decided to just take that plans so while I was swimming on the water with all these fishwale that I saw do Sharks struck me your I should probably just go for it because it kind of was like I was reached out to me I didn't go to searching for it I knew what it was at study the power of interest but I never thought I'd end up doing it so after my dive I went back to the surface and met that guy I told him that tonight will do when I was katran he was a Sham in Asiaguide you through the experience when you consume I was some Shamil will also consumes some of it along with you and some people say that your Shamil kind of share your experience will also be a part of your whole journey along with I was come here is what I saw according to his room he did a few rituals Rekha bf Mantra Jana country he said a few of his commitment was poured out two shots of I was scheduledbrown liquid which is smelling better the brown liquid in the same thought of just falling into the ocean took over my head adjustable glass ground it best choices ever made especially for my career I will come to why Leto the stock of the experience first half an hour nothing happens every thing still normal measurement told me specifically the moment you start feeling something this which the lights off andnothing happened initially only a look at the walls I look the floor I look at the roof and everything is becoming a little more Jelly like celebrity vanished from the floor I looked everywhere and everything is becoming a liquid he was kind of moving and this is the beginning of the trip feel likewhat is happening inside ok to begin so he made me lie down switch off the lights are also laid down to close my eyes at close my eyes and the one thing that my Oscar trip was Defined by the presence of animals have no idea why but animals were something I was always drawn to even as a child at watch night jio AdyarDiscovery Channel all day ago wale just swallowing me when I went inside the Waves mouth this long road suddenly I felt like I was kind of going down of car in the road was in the car is a sliding down the road in some kind of the seat I didn't know I was happening I open my eyes and everything everything is normal I was given feeling tired of higher or anythingand I just told him on a Sunday you want this is happening its not just about to close your eyes and just keep experiencing it go deeper your trip I swear to God of healing completely so when I asked him that is it normal said yes and this is why is not directly ational Dragon doesn't take your senses away from you to completely and control and honestly if you wanted to stop it will stop but if you want to good people that will get your answers 1 important pointI want to put a cross you guys this is something I forgot to mention earlier in this podcast you have to have an intention when your doing your I was your trip is my intention at this stage of my life was extremely on the confident and no self belief I was constantly being told by my family my friends by the world that this beerbiceps choice was the wrong one another or failright then have to go back and re-enter the rat race which are drawn away from which they make videos about why you shouldn't be entering at the start of the trip and had also asked me to write down the question that I had for mother are you asking the question that I wanted answered I wrote two questions for squarewas this is something that started is it the right directions for my life when doing the right thing and the second question adjust is that really want success in my life what's the one thing I should be adding to my personality what's the one there should be working on two extremely simple questions coming back to the experience of these two questions about lifeI got in return was animal imagery and the kind of guy who even today we have dreams important dreams always contain an element of some animal and say that in the study of Dreams as lots of website all about dreams you should check this out you say you have a lion doing some particular thing in your dream attacking you why you're riding the back of a lion in all means something animal presence in your dreams mean something that happens to a lot of peoplespiritual Journeys seeing and my I was experiencing keep in mind that point my spiritual journey had not big on the sea animals so I felt my Shamil next me I felt he was also on the road with me and suddenly me and him Bataun into different animals we will lions at first then it on and Horses and tornado Dragons and you're just going down the roadpeace with this weird hallucination I looked up around me away from the road and I saw these little Windows and doors Windows contain ki memories from my life now I want it actually and do some of those memories like almost like time travel on the travel back to those important character building moments in my life at the moment I do wish popped up in my head this masqueradeask actually entered the hallucination it was a feminine looking masquerade mask with wings and I'm just settle down like a feather right in front of me while I was traveling down the road it was travelling with me floating near me kind of landed on me it touched me I touch the mask I realise that that was my version of mother was CA be alright mask took me awayand ask me about my everyone into Windows from my child sitting and watching TV after school complete peace with your homework is probably a friday evening you watching some cartoon with your sister you very happy peaceful childhood memory I stayed there for a while I felt like the concept of time but extremely stressed outattend a good for BCA the following month in the timeline of that dimension and then come out and it was a problem in just a few seconds in the real dimension to seconds in the real dimension could be as long as you want in the I Oscar dimension suspense sometime in that memory third person just seeing these two kids myself and my sister can apply kvl time travelling experience came out of that tripanother trip where I saw a negative experience in my parents were shouting at me about something about something in specific play heard that whole shouting experience as a third person Vivo and it kind of taught me certain things about myself in one old podcast please forward implicit memory things that happened in your childhood someone shouted at you some negative experiences with leaves cars forever you don't even know why you have those cars as an adult you don't know I also confused negative neural pattern she don't know what you thinkHero No I thought it would probably why certain words w experience is only given these impressive memories I was my first experience of the year experience in pleasant Memories and I went inside multiple Windows and found these old impressive memories of myself and a lot of my current path patterns in life made sense to me That's My Kind of your the dark that's why I kind of doubt myself so much ok this is whyI feel like a procrastinator much I started also getting the solutions in my head I did was happening but then it also struck me that hold on its been awhile since I've been in the stripe payment not supposed to puke it usually what happened writers read online that you puke after I was feeling slightly initiated I was feeling fine happy how is enjoying their experience that time travelling hours like experiencing this beautiful scenario that it didn't know your mind is capable of experienceexperiencing this is very crucial for the mood of the story in video games another life metre that's as big as 100 points when you go to the next level of a video game some lines of individuals are you know what from hundred 110 points in terms of your life metre imagine I had happiness metre that locked at 100 I was allowed me to access a new dimension of happiness it was a slightly more elevatedfeeling happy of the never felt that at this point in my life as little or as self doubt the was in that what happens in my life but I was unlock something new in my dinner was happening but kept continuing down that trip also felt a strong presence of God for the first time in the trip while I've read a lot my childhood I was in the spiritual care growing a playwright and you're the one god is higher power and you got aExpress gratitude to God of kind of ask what you want that all that the concept of God Was me I was mother I was that masquerade mask was leading me down that I was called Union at the same time I felt like a masculine presence with I consider the presence of God came down and lead me along the road along with madawaska the two elements of the higher power of feminineI was an element which was father God once I felt this presence of parents felt exactly for those elements the vehicle for my parents ok mum and dad wonderful that combined presence I went back to my original question that I am I doing the right thing in life and straight up and so was hole on letterSattu hallucination parents changed of the entire trip for me I'm experiencing the role in the animals and time travelling Windows The scenery changed into the side of a highway No cars on the highway at Jassi the Horizons on the two ends so the parent showed me one end of the Horizon and I heardmessage sound like something use was coming my way before I knew it I should take Fireball just flash across meet came from one Horizon went across me and went to the other Horizon and as it went its size kept increasing I was that element of God looked at me and told me that is your career if you continueon this current path that you are on that's what this particular Road can lead you to know about my second question second question was what do I need to add to my mind in order to maximize my success and parents kind of looked at me and said you got everything that you need to succeed other than self belief10 self belief that stage of my life I spent four years in Engineering College during insult from each other's work site with their own lives during my parents say that marks and great I hope you can do something in life during my friends it is like why you're not going abroad you make the wrong choice by staying back in India during negative feedback that just be turned on my self belief 20.7 hundred pointsvery negative mind spaced behan a moment he told me that you need to incorporate the concept of self belief in your existence everything fade away the trip stopped happening does nothing as darkness even close your eyes to see the resources that mad open my eyes and a back in the hotel room look at my Sham inI woke him up throughout this experience was doing a few chances to your future Samne transfer house to withdrawn from a mouse to within myself with environment within my own experience I looked at him was full of emotion and I couldn't explain my entire trip to him price at the end of the trip was this is to questions that I wrote on a piece of paper these are the answersright choice was gonna be one Fireball of a career but I need to tell myself that I am capable of killing it in my own life and the charming look at me and ask me what were the negative aspect of the experience I looked at him and I just started crying 22 year old but power of the sweeping Lil baby cryingI don't know the was O negative experience was so happy powerful positive and he looked at me and said this is the height of the negative aspect of this experience shows that it only negative aspect of it would you probably not capable of handling more negativity at this point maybe in the future when you are slightly stronger mentally and if you try doing I was again maybe you'll have a more intense negative Experience At the stage of life I was only give you what you can handleTilak Terminus ideas properly to I was a different person after that day I didn't tell my parents about it but still not told them in detail about this experience but I swear to God I felt like one personality entering that I was experience and other personality exiting from it actually Lead me to researchlot more about I was scientific aspects of a biological aspects of and of everything I read that neural pattern they told us about that it creates a new apartment for something I experienced in an extremely strong where I felt like I was more power ferrite someone give me an extremely powerful so-called self belief that the People's accounts of doing I was everyone said that it gives them the weapon that they needed at that stage of their lifeno one had a negative I was ka experience very rarely on the blood you come across most people say that it was a character building experience very very very crucial to know it is not safe to go out searching for I was experiences and I feel you shouldn't is two reasons why explain the scientific reason first scientific reason is a lot of people who crocs lot of Ek Sham and routeDasha man was legitimate explain the lot more details to me but I haven't spoken word on this podcast but I knew for a fact that he was a legitimate Sham in Hindi what you are talking about he was trained by 6 mins in the Amazon rainforest lot of people which is mixing and matching chemical substances and selling as I was conducted by the important not to go out looking for it but if you are looking for it I am going to ask you this you looking for it because you want to experience I willI want to add some element within your character Deewane heel something within yourself I was caused primarily for people who have lived out life enough to have been broken enough by life to need some kind of ceiling ceiling is the keyboard later in life I discovered meditation strangely thanks to the same Sham in about 6 months later in IndiaIndia explain how much stop doing I was had gotten into this thing called meditation explain basic on chanting meditation to be given the Guys a white your opinion that alright he got into Om chanting meditation 7 wonders taking a deep breath giving back straight and when you breathe out you go all his greatest healing experiences of his life 20 minutes ofpetition every single day and ask them that is it the same as doing I was CA I give me the analogy with a completely agree with he said that what is I was basically an experience that flatters your brain with DMD at dmt is what makes it happen what breaks new apartment what makes new apartment what changes the structure of your brain BMT is a substance that can be producedwithin your body as well within your mind is something called a pineal gland in pop culture the pineal gland is also referred to as the third eye tisri Aankh opening to another dimension the pineal gland get stimulated when you do deep meditations especially when you practice daily meditations use the analogy he gave me while I was cause like downbarrel full of whisky in one go meditation is having a sip of whiskey once upon a time to eat meditation session won't be as powerful iTunes when I was session but in the long term meditation daily meditation dost emulate the production of dmt within your mind because the state of place that causes that state of extended happiness that changes themind over time but most importantly it helps you level up it helps you level up by killing you from within a slipped into the process of deep meditation that's why I promote the idea of meditation this much is basically the same thing is that your brain is flooded would dmt only at 3 moments within your existence the first is a newborn second is when youmy life flash before my eyes remember that time travel and I'll give you about my when I was your experience with the prince and the empty you don't have correct concept of time on certain time change the time being stretched out that happens near death when you know you're gonna die time too stressed out you go through an extremely intense BMT style experience of the brain is lightweight TMT third movieis in very vivid dream for crazy stuff is happening within your dreams of flying to controlling the shape of buildings around you that's when your brain is flooded with a Lil bit of the empty IV way to release DMD naturally in your mind is by stimulating a pineal gland overtime to daily meditation and never wanted to do I was after that there will be no age for that but as I've gotten into Deepa government Deepa spirituality have reached a stage and a death in my meditation where I do get lost in my own mind sometimes my meditation get so deep that I lose my sense of Identity I don't remember the youtuber I don't remember whether or not a man or woman I don't remember my own name who I am what I do I just have a sense of me being someone who is within their ownbooks on my breath out my focus boils down to be kind of strange experience is happen through deep meditation all of you who stayed in this and this podcast this point I'm a very in treated by the concept of Alaska but I stress on this statement once again don't go out sharing it if it has to come to you it will come to you you don't choose I was I was that uses you but what I doyou to do if Heal yourself take a deep dive into the world of spirituality if you do want to flood your brain with the empty you don't have to go to the Amazon rainforest to get into the habit of daily meditation and good people into that spiritual journey Asma Carriers and folded I look at that I was ka experience and I realise that it made me realise that such intensedeep spiritual experiences are possible you can feel the presence of mother and father God and his big fireballs and future predictions and time travel on the larger than life experiences a possible in this world within our existence were brought up in a certain work being told go to school college going to job after go to this go to that controlled environment but is a complete dimension of that waiting to be tapped intocoordinator member that opened up the possibility of personal change through spiritual Journeys and through meditation if I feel like meditation is the single biggest factor in my life today that possibility of meditation beginning that I was ka Jivani and that's why I always stress that doing I was the one spiritual turning point of my life but I became open to all of concept that I didn't know exist use be that guy who would make fun of people liketo promote the idea of meditation promote the idea of this Crazy experiences like I was ka naam that guy was talking about importance and on

bro please make a video on advanced meditation at exactly what we're doing with doctor Radhakrishnan Pillai he is by far the smartest human being that have come across in this country my life time also extremely spiritually advances and mentoring for more than thirty years he's got a lot of information and his mind when it comes to advanced meditation the sign according to the Big Don meditation into two parts the force is the basic and meditation representation to meditate for 20 min sadev what if you want to take a tourhigh level of weight training what if you want to powerlifting now when it comes to meditation to guys if you want some guidance on where to begin your advanced meditation process that's what this podcast will give you also keep in mind that the audio version of this podcast is link in the description down below so make sure you check the order from Oracle listener the water and as always the comment section below for a breakdown of the episodes of you want to skip to particular topic in the comments section so this is doctor allocation play on the Runonce again this is dope on advanced meditation enjoy yourselves Om Shanti Shanti and everybody was come to another intelligent conversation only episode of the Ranveer show we got one of India's smartest man Dr Radhakrishnan Pillai so so thank you again for being a part that is like being a part of the family is like comingthank you once again Ranveer for making a part of the show is gonna whenever we do Bollywood watkiss one of the top comments is why you doing what you want to do you agree 100% in fact without meditation you can't achieve most of the higher things that was performed including material wealthit's a byproduct of meditation maybe not the real efforts should be put on material benefit alone but those people who meditate also gain in the middle level if they want to elaborate on the whole lot of people begin the carrier and the question you know where does meditation fit into this whole career growth thing shop so I think I would split meditation three levels by the physical second is a mental and the third is a spiritual levelmay have different purposes to it so if you look at the physical level of people who say you know exercise kar lo and then you know your mind meditation take some 3D breasts shutdown quietly baby Sasta do Omkar chanting and the physical level and it does actually make you much healthy are better when you breathe and sit quietly for some time but I think the real game starts when you move in from the physical to the mental level because finally the body and the mind both areand I just say that man is what is thoughts are you can count on your thoughts sweating a lot of benefits right from your stress which we can distance ourselves a look at you know if your going through depression state of your my India in administration could help with that said I'm almost the metal that you figure out you begin meditating that just the way physical exercise can you know benefit your physical body doing a bicycle benefits for biceps with actual experience deep Marathirealise we tune my brain is going to some exercises like this you know hearing and reading about swimming and actually doing something to get in the water front of people have read books on meditation lot of theories but you don't do it I think will never understand what's in it for me it is writing and do it regularly like their thing that's what you called in Sanskrit in Hindi officers club was continuously doing andthe time will benefit from it safe to go to the gym first time in I am ok I would look good second it will start paining in a certain you with all the muscles are stressed and then you should ok second and third time and then comes a point of time when you are not exercising is when you feel bad so whatever they say in 21 days habit creation of habit you actually Can't Stop meditation of physical mental and spiritualI think that's the real real benefit of meditation so when we look at in a lot of people were expecting some tangible results from meditation so I know of companies to promote meditation yoga and arrow International they want their profits to go up because we have a calm person you have more productive people you take better decisions you don't mess up things but the end result is that in order to on the balance sheet our shareholders happy ok that is a good start but you like to hire ana basic education school is ok colleges ok but we can't university level is all about research the highest level of Education Academy spiritual gain and that time you start looking at the whole life in a different look it from a detached point of it and real meditator really doesn't care about the valuable effects even the world even if it would come to the angles and its fine but you know I want to go not just to understand the mind that actually go beyond the mind that the highest age and then you know that finallymind game in the beyond the mind concept ok so I think let's go to the very basics what is your mind mind is a flow of thoughts that is what Swami Chinmayanand ji my spiritual Gurus to tell some ideas of law of torts and if there are no thought there is no mind but people have never actually consciously understood that could be state of mind and thoughts with the moment and thoughts no mind in reality all of us go through it on every day basis where do we do that sleep no I was even go todeep sleep I would say the first is the waking state that we also see the second doesn't know any good to sleep but actually be dreaming the brain is still active your mind is selected exactly but you know that few hours when you are beyond time when I suppose you are very tired you had a very heavy De heavy workout you just hit the button Logon and the moment you get up if it's been four hours 5 or 6 hours that time there is no thought but there will also be times when youbut when you are actually imagine think maybe what happened during the day people going to INR on the effects of going through horror images in the mind now that's not Atlas mind it is sleep with your mind is active in creating things imagine probably this is still not the state of mind so in fact in the Indian literature there is a final stage to go beyond the managed turiya avastha beyond everything and in a lot of people go theI want to come back on this is horrible like you talking words are those in the Himalayas and those kind people absolutely in fact I can tell you a story also about every well known sale in modern india it's all Sai Baba Shirdi Ke Sai Baba everybody was a story about him that he once meditated and he told his people ok I am going to go into the state of Samadhi and I will come back what is what is Samadhi Samadhi exact this particular point where are you know it's like you're using meditationtool it's like when you are going what the sports called you want to use the pool but you live in the polygon other side so use your mind meditation to solve another study go that you jump over into the executive the mind and thoughts to do that so Sai Baba of Shirdi actually did that once and he told the samadhi state where am Iwhat happened actually went to the state and the body was absolutely flat and people setting is dead so the whole discussion that happened among all the people sitting and knowledge very nice Bond because you know when the person is dead May Cry but the fact remains that in the body's ability can be harmful for others but his devotees turn on Sai Baba Tola is equal to come back come back it's been a few days now you can't have this one actually consciously comes back to another story about how you got the answer Manyavaryou come back and lot of people have seen this in the expenses redmi 1 other like Sai Baba we have Ramkrishna paramhans Yeh who was the Guru of Swami Vivekananda I'm so he is used to always in Samadhi avastha and it's not like they were going once it was very difficult to get him back to normal state so there been recorded experiences so you suggest going to Trance do that level of Samadhi beyond the mind in suddenly used to come back and see rasgulla rasgulla rasgullaAnda Anda ki 1:00 Rasgulla behind it and then people as to what is whole coronavirus affected meditating you come back and Rasgulla Rasgulla consciously aware that I am going to that state but if I go that I may never come back a lot of things to eat to do this for the world so what are you doing that I leave one thought behind it should bring me back in that state some where are you know I get conscious you ok ok what is advantage of this correctly it is a very firstmental and spiritual awareness for highly evolved souls who understand everything is beyond this mind and beyond this world 100% so I'll give you an example of 26/11 to please share your meditation experiences before I talk about the actual experience of come to last weekend story out with my friends and they were drinking I stopped drinking since I don't know how long having two years now and the question to me was why do you not drink so my childhood beerbicepsshow the connection I will I will I will I will tell you this story as well and I am deep into my Yoga practice and honestly believe it or not I do feel Hai 24 7 without actually taking a strong because your mind is kind of calm down to their level colours are more saturated mind is working with faster than two before you start a meditation practiceyou know in few sentences sweets like telling I'm already on a high I don't required but their immediate response when they listen to me saying no but I'm already on a high is a Kuchh Bhi so it's difficult to explain and more than anythingme has been my internal world has become very kam even if there is like the worst trouble in my life in my work I am so come from the inside and all the decisions all the solution happen in a very calm state of mind what happened over time there were busy husband the actual practice meditation the practice of Yoga in Crisis which is a yoga and meditation advanced yoga but it also kind of training your own mind if you can go right into the new stop the albumconsciously agitation rising to understand this is not correct at the time but this begin back and 2015 When we start biceps I was into bodybuilding powerlifting and I read that meditation this thing called meditation can never experience of my life over it helps in muscle recovery so that had gotten into something that will like this help Heal faster so I can get even bigger muscles andI do begin doing Om chanting back then and now the first ever in one place you close your eyes you breathe in breathe out everyone loved you do that you do for 20 minutes at some point you know ok now it's time to open your eyes the first time you open your eyes you look around you see that the floor of your room the roof of your Road everything colours of very saturated colours of very intense and you feel a new kind of come youthat moment you very happy that moment a very peaceful and possibly also some answers to your career as a business the longer you meditate the more intense all these experiences but the key here is again practice eventually I was blessed of to discover a lot of courses that are the that the one advantage of living in India with people don't understand that there is a spiritual capital of this planet us and anything you want advanced meditation live alone in this country shop only only like thatloan abroad but if you want a Buddhist form of the purest forms of Meridian is all in this country so I went for initially I went for reiki course I went for a transcendental meditation course and eventually after doing a bunch of these courses I found Yogananda satsanga society after reading the book called the autobiography of a yogi book that inspired me to another degree but is my meditation story and I do feel that meditationis biology of a body is Inventory of non veg didn't drink don't worry vices any more but what is really gifted me with is Superhuman abilities for my work to write fast brain processing power Harvard study Subah this time for studies to back this URL link them down below read those read how meditation Retreat change of the structure of your cerebrum yes so but my question dual hours can you take your meditation story and how it actually helped change your personality yourworld renowned author today your planet what is it specifically to you on human level thank you for sharing your story is because it's so beautiful to know that it actually helped get the physical and at various levels as the so let me tell you my story I have been almost melted in for the last 30 audios and because I've been connected with Chinmaya Mission spiritual organisation since my childhood you know there was a spiritual background it so my entryOsmosis pressure level itself to the kind of people the physical the mental and we were at the spiritual level 6 been very fortunate so in the initial stages in a when I was a child in US to go to this child classes in Chinmaya Mission College Bal Vihar ok ok now it's a simple instructions in a sit-down don't be a question mark substrate and the breads and three times as a kid is a theek hai what's your mind your mind is a monkeycan you see it going can you tell him to come back general instructions on the child starting point as they grew up and started singer ok the different forms of meditation also different schools of thought and there is actually theory which is documented for example Patanjali yoga sutras is on the most fantastic books which talks about meditation and talks about physical level discipline to be a good Yog you are a meditator like like for example Patanjali yoga Sutra actually saysyoga Chitta vritti to what happens is that if there is what is yoga state-of-the-art Lakshman achieve that but no it's not possible reason that is it down and there were no thoughts Chitta is your thought has to be eliminated this is not possible they once what you do that you actually started the basic level 3 amanya mother different steps obesity discipline yourself ok can I sit down don't worry about meditation but maybe as a beginner just sit down for 10 minutesdo not worry about it slowly and what you said baby eating the right for getting her parents all these basic pink started realising that are theories of meditation then my father being a meditator you be served as a father is it to your soul and meditate for 8 hours a day and is the sweetest person I've ever seen the world so Father used to actually do a form of meditation is actually Vipassana teachers vibrant and it Vipassana course the fashion as where you have the followingbalance for 10 days what he does a fortified tried that but then I actually have want to talk what happened at the end of you describe what happens when I was introduced to my father so what happened is actually meditate and still continues told me that I also do you do one thing that curiosity wasbest part about spirituality for me it was a day and I was never forced into spirituality is to be calculated in Amazon after members do it do it will never told you have to do it was a young boy acid ok so let me try so the person is a form of meditation taught by Buddha and it said that basically lot of the secrets of ours was stored in the purest form of outside India for example the people who now practice Vipassana meditation actually mostfollowers of Goenka ji who is Goenka ji he was a person who actually been Burma and Indian satellite in Barmer and once I had a migraine problem nothing about it are Goenka ji had a migraine problem and somebody told you are there is some Vipassana meditation in Burma ok so there was a Buddhist teacher who actually told is in the I will teach you something is actually comes from your country is called a person that what SBI personal loan and I've only had one thing Mera migraine Jana chahie he taught him intoanyway gone as a byproduct but there is a secret that not many Indians know about it she came to India in started telling people you know so what is Vipassana meditation it starts with basic steps of you know watching your breath so you know what your presence of very easy because you'll watch red in tooth recycle the mind will go in it back bring it back to List the factors that you do it for 10 days and you can't be done by the which very important that meditation also requires some to guide you in the processor go bonkers andanytime day meditation as we're definitely types of meditation should have a Guru of course if you are going to the gym you require Kochi Kochi meyeder spoil your muscle and meeting are doing into pulitha Apno actually meet your in your muscles are you are the points I think is important it makes that initial process fast also I feel and don't to the mistakes which problem others do you reach your goals faster because I actually talking about Chanakya concert yearwith the person with device and experience person was walk the path before you ask me what happened is that when I did meditation file I can provide Goenka ji actually got Re Nanda Guru he came back to India and started teaching at this form of vegetation and today Vipassana meditation is across the globe as Lord of centres in Igatpuri in Bombay Igatpuri Maharashtra Daura full service centre in Bombay we have Essel World theme park just make sure that there is a Buddhist Pagoda 10000Milte together over the worldwide moment so the basic I think all of us who are interested in knowing the person I should attend the cause of 10 days and the best part is absolutely free of cost don't charge you so what happens at the end of the course so I think one of my very dear students and colleagues at my office Pranav Patel it is sent to the petitioner campaign came back and the first thing as well as compared to business together nowactually you can be a normal person without speaking to anyone ok specially still be don't speak it out we don't feel comfortable human beings have to speak out you can go with all the energy that is used to go outside is now getting used to go inside and used for what I think it's like having a very shop nice knife allowed to ask you that you so what it depends on you so your surgeon will use the sameNahin to sirf somebody's life so basically if you waste a lot of urinary talking in thinking outward in doing things out what's your blunting your knife is that like what you're saying absolutely sure using it answer and he is very important coming back to the basic question of meditation to actually conserve energy conservation parts information is also a mode not allowing certain parts to come in and you know so if you look at the basic level they say you know the time for meditation there is a place for meditation in thisamenities of basics for example you can't sit outside it has been nominated for puja room light a candle have a photo of a God and the letter agarbatti and get up in the morning at 4 o'clock many people think why is this basic required the reason is that basically these are all ecosystems that will help you in any shall baby steps was 4 o'clock half of the world is sleeping with the real Yogesh addresses this admitting the Himalayas later onlike a tiring cycle chalu required to support you balance but no 101 the habit of you can we are Highway also and what do you think the real meditators a 24-hour meditators so there actually active in the business world running a Kingdom probably as a king or may be doing acting show and show like this but the mind is like a very fast mode address and America mode that by fish shop and shop in used for the right reason to sharpen knife can be dangerous if it is usedothers Sarovar can use it so sharp and mind should also be used for nobel purposes and what is important and meditate for service of the people coming back to your topicmy music I don't think there's anything wrong with that writing is used to benefit of becoming come but beyond the early mental and spiritual benefits you need to do a proper technical meditation is free of Technology as just what I think but so what do you think I think absolutely right because see that too many apps around and you got one more App Maker fitness happen meditation of you download it from saying that it's good but you know as we say Google search is not research information visitstools are good but interesting part of that if you want to really be a serious meditator then you should actually have a Guru somewhere you should get associated with some organisation people a lot of people in the modern day a kind of look down on the practice of gurus practice of joining organisation acquires Chinmaya Mission just because everything is too old school it's like they look downloaded thinking I know this is religious I want to get into itI think that if you just give yourself that 10 moment of reaching out in search of knowledge and practice and all forward you see the rest of my life changed within one month also just follow someone get that initial Spark and then take care of yourself but the open to joining one of these courses that's what I feel absolutely shoppingdefinition of a meditation Guru deep question definitely someone who speaks to you I am very drawn to Sadguru just the thing this as and also other devices which is your grandparents day when I read this book I felt it was talking direct talking to my heart so I will listen to your intuition is this something in this person that really connect to you that is a chance that wasn't Coldplayuse role in your life shop and it's not been in the long term if you are following one Guru that beneficial for uni advanced meditation but initially you should have perspective at least of what what is Satguru ji saying what is your grandparents g-sync just too kind of develop your own mind in a 360 degree Mano to speak to you not to your heart and also a place where you definitely you feel like mine and reached after listening to that personyou feel terminated as well as on emotional and spiritual level in my home brilliant now let me go to the next level has won the question was answered you require a Guru who is physically interacting with you in mind we speak to may be discussed with you is it necessary that the topic I want to bring up in this podcast which is Astral bodies the deep topic ok now this is not available on YouTube area and this is something that a lot of everydaywill laugh upon these people don't to elaborate on this topic because I am in the presence of doctor Radhakrishnan Pillai so I am going to allow you to question back at you that the smartest man in Indiastock for most of us request somebody with American talk to discuss with you because what happens is that absolutely right no you look at what Satguru ji is doing amazing I think I know of friends have heard and seen every single video office but I also know that the first ever and the actual lined up doing a course with Sadguru in his classroom you know I already knew Sadguru start subscene iterate is book 17 then when I went over there I could actually feel I was very differently in fightingreading about Guru is very important but what's more important if you by the grace of God and that's very important that the grace of God I actually find a Guru can speak to talk to then it's different is like saying I am charging my battery somewhere other than directly charging from the source that doesn't mean you know if you don't have a physical Guru should not ml water Gurus can be Astral is well known physical police what I'm saying the quality of the student is more important when it comes to the teacher we locate to greatof Mahabharat Arjun directly under the teachers lekin kripacharya bheeshmacharya man whom do you think is more better as a student at Pacific Eklavya absolutely but you are also two letters in four years later we also also saw a lot of people watching the thinking thatbut how do I get a Guru which is on physical hundred percent quick modern-day answer is books written by greatness is absolutely right when you have those great Masters one more physically around still the books can inspire you just told about autobiography of Yogi can I spoke about maybe Swami Chinmayanand ji aur Sai Baba you replace all these people have written books this a guiding people tell you one very interesting book is called I am that Bane Sagaryou know about half of the Rope following is just around the corner of your absolutely right some books like of Vedas and all other books are actually getting people imitation I feel like some books actually alive but you only understand their life once you read the book is a documented form of the knowledge of the groom is not just a book is living master book form hundred percent I understand I think the sun and moon EP 12 free download of spiritual books they are really I highly recommend people iswritten by Sadhguru himself but this is one book called 2 ways to light the very easy read it about the Astral world and that is a topic I want to tackle right now in Bangalore is between the Bangalore Airport and the main city in a village called upon arriving at the name of a highly recommend you read that book if you are interested in the concept of your soul leaving body and travelling around theyou your consciousness and your mind going using the pole vaulting technique getting past your own physical body and then going on in the world and the universe very the book not everyone's cup of tea I don't understand why people laugh on the I also strongly recommend this one sentence with you should register in head through knowledge is knowing that you know nothing I just like with the topic to talk about right now it might seem little crazy butmissing you elaborate on what is the physical body versus what is the Astral so we talk about Astral body is Astral travel Astral meditation is a different plane all together so what happens that many people who are the beginners Meridian believe it out and travel the world and come back with enough evidences of people actually having out of the body experiences and we will check on the person is that canI am not going to tell you about the body experiences I have personally actually gone through this experience sale exactly what is happening is that tell you experience it Unites like talking about sugar to somebody was never tasted how does sugar activities and it's very easy to know what do you mean by sweet sweet means this I don't understand this sweet sweet means not beok smart beta it's about what is sweet is ok wait about this to speak to experience what is sweetness thing coming my clash Royale travel I think it happens with lot of people of fact is it was like any other with the eyes not Rocket Science reflection that space you can I actually got the body you'll your soul leaves tree and then comes back with this body is only instrument and you know that's why when you look at thepanchappa punarjanma what happens when the body is changing rebirth this is exactly what is that I am now the soul is in this work the body of the soul is actually using this body the body will get one of lekin old cloth bobbepalli as good a new one touch my body is travelling from one word to another and using different bodies to in his spiritual journey known as somebody put it we are not human beings on spiritual journey is actually a spiritual souls on human journalnational travels are people who actually can use this body Gora the body may be entered into another body use that body and come back now this is that the more the physical ability can people can actually go to different planes I also feel that you know this all these things are beyond science but you should also understand that science is as advanced as you think it is this still a lot for science to recover special Western world the Vedas the ancient Indian books talk about things like this is something you will not believe you are tuned to reading a text box andthe world according to physics chemistry biology match when they might be a 5th subject with you don't even know about this is that subject so just listen to do with an open mind also understand that this is why I don't eat non veg I don't recall because if you make a body impure don't get beautiful experiences like this one thing beerbiceps is beyond wine and beer and biceps also within a few of the factors is cheaper body pure there's a lot of mental factors in termsnot updated not losing your PC coming angry voting other people all that also kind of mixer system impure and not able to have Astral experiences I am not Sab Astral travel I will highlight of you your the when in deep meditation some that I can feel like I do that there are still experience we can see my body from a bird's eye view so happened you so I think most of us go through it fighting betweenaware of it honestly have you felt sometimes you know that you are in a place completely for the first time in for a second hits wincing live into this place before they argue that experience is not by practice this persons in the same colours same room this is not new but actually your come the first ever so thatactually a different experience we can call it at a different planes of the body exactly the body different planes in Reno OK what is a second explain it coming back to me also have seen actually seeing people who have been almost declared dead medically there are some processor so there are other people was done and actually after almost any for his come back and his actual experience you know I have gone and then you know somebody stop me I'm into different planenude go back I am not saying it is about science it's also about their experiences so it is a very fevers book called as the laws of the spirit world and if you had about it actually written by a person who actually was made to write true spirit and it is not don't get fat in short horror usse somebody makes you write a book is called exam devil entering into a livingfree to use your body some divine soul when is a truck black magic knows not black magic it's me white magic for allowing yourself to get empty and ok so there are a lot of shows in this study the world who don't know we'll work with you don't find a noble soul Achcha kam Karen do something very noble but it was here is a guy that you can request that can I use your body is to allow it actually Logon Noble work happened to let me tell you are asking about my experience one ofspiritual Masters Hotel something very deep visit in the God also looks at the right people to do his work but the question is where are you that right person saptarishi is always there that all around and their chirenjivi they never die so if you look at Hanuman Ji the lot of people say you know when did Hanuman Ji actually died he never died and there are great Rishi is was still around so Bindi Astral world using their in backthis world simultaneously to the travel industry would become back to our world people have experience with them but think what is very important that in a letters not look at this world only being what we touch and feel and see the something beyond what we can exist parali there are many diamonds to its colour the shape but is also called heat so can you see the heat resort at the same time there is a quality of you know the materialwhat happens is that you like It's like a sponge and also take a sponge and print the hot water and take away everything signal corresponding to said there is a witness in it there is heat and it therefore is also it as a colour and shape to its not that different the all properties of the same object at the same time the mine also can pink diamond in is it can be two places simultaneously can travel and come back and there are a lot of cases about you knowRavina the physical level of a horrible stories of great resource to they have been seen at two different physical place in the same time at 7 o'clock your in somebody's is you know but you all seven o'clock at my place which is likely to have a photograph 7 o'clock this is a no I also a photograph is my mobile and streams right but possible for people who have used the same physical body to multiplytravelling people go from this body help out somebody come back then uses the body so let me your very very famous example from our Indian scriptures and history about it said that basically Adi Shankaracharya ji ok he was a yogi Astral travel what happened is that he was a Bal Brahmachari so he never got married and also had a debate with the scholar and some where you are getting defeated on the pathgoing through the whole experience of being a married man se Bal Brahmachari is over the physical level water was the intellectual ok bye bye your points when you ask me questions about marriage problems in summer Bal Brahmachari I don't know it is said that actual the ok wait I will debate with you but we had an experience that doesn't mean you can get married another minute to go to the hall cycles of being a married man should then he just went around and left is body using mental women's body or a man's bodywhat is married women experience to understand what is the mind of a person was married in call to so that is conscious living the Yogi is can do that you can do it for example let's say I don't know this lot of people who is it ok if I had to be like Gandhiji Gandhiji soul is still there in Astral plane me to invoke him to talk to him and then what I'm saying is that if you are mind is getting tune to other souls can actually go experiencethe body or invite them into your body all this looks very very grand and you know very magical but remember one thing the moment you start misusing it or rather using it without a Guru can be dangerous something that it is important that all through the all exist on WhatsApp purpose the population not be getting more powerful famous and misuse it all this knowledge is important as long as you're using it for your own spiritual and other spiritual benefits do you think there are people in the world to use thisto become rich and famous I'm not sure of that but why not so I think a person who is rich and famous for me is a two levels the people who actually you know about Lord of harder than they have become rich people feel a connection to it will become rich overnight in certain there is a blessings of the divine Universe awesome god that you believe it have Metro route ofwhich super rich people across the globe the truly humble because I know in spite of all the food that we put there is something beyond which they feel which we don't feel explain it in luck because I amin fact I could see a lot of spiritual connection with people like you and Steve Jobs on the matter if you look at it was going around like a Hippie in the latter part of Steve Jobs is very different from the first you know he's gone too long experience is the best days in Apple you still not his own company we also officially Khud study was a part of the Hare Krishna and he goes that somewhere they look at the connect the dots as used in you find this shows to become rich men for that matter Rockefellerhard very different level then the physical level the like you and me but the reality is in the mind is a very walled mind reading some where they have 2 secrets with smaller than never disclose writing now why did Steve Jobs not allowing children to use iphone will only knows about everything story the person we actually made iPhone for the whole work at the described his own children from using it so they knew that technology which I create it may be distraction to a different level of growthmodern to understand that spirituality has to the basement understand success at the material but coming back to Astral travel a lot of the listeners are still stuck on how do people get after experiences like what do you have to do to get an asterisk speakers things I think if you are really interested master travel I think first of all you pray to God of Universe in a small childmama mama please please please chocolate is coming from which shop to go to the first put that on the universal basic level important to read about it but this understanding and try Baby steps and I would say that for all those people who want to actually get the Real Experience please find a group mein told you before we find a good to be really since a student can read about it write about those things I know it's very important that you start with the help of those people who already are in a grouponly The Spiritual Organisation in practice this Sciences part of it because I don't make it a lonely journey have some people what travel journey before you and they will give those experiences as a youtuber being made basic meditationChinese whispers of really don't want and knowledge to be little bit what we can use for two years and I'm still not affect the technique of Yoga in the centre some Universal correct missing your moving finger not the weight should be perfect in my own that can't put out the information on the internet but if you are in search for itadding the call to action for you is first read those books read read satguru's books read device would you recommend any other books that people should read initially in fact to inspire all of you cannot even into it I would suggest that one very beautifully written book which has inspired me to Astral travel also is many life many Masters it's actually about an American doctor who actually she is a no after that experience of many of these patients many lives many Masters and BC is thissolutions doctor and is able to observe a lot of people were dying is during death people go through the strange experience and strives to map it scientifically knows maybe like science logic right we find that in a person is dying is actually communicating to someone speaking different languages on so what is a pattern here is that every particular soul actually has had a spiritual master with him throughout the life around you aware of it is protecting youit seems the child in the women of the person who is closer to the death actually can speak and talk to them so he starts talking to the understanding the manager realise is actually all people who have ekarmik way of keeping those Masters with us so I would suggest that in that book it be chords and many life the many Masters you are with you is a very beautiful book and a real-life experience book of a great doctor scientifically proven that it works so please read that also read booksgenuinely go for one of these causes for inner engineering Isha Foundation Chinmaya Mission has light u r the one who is close to your heart andgoing down the master part because of you know the bad reputation of all these like the random Gurus and all that that's not that's not a good generalisation to make a lot of us who have way more knowledge than any scientist in the world right now I think if you really get into this try and expedition in Himalayas because that's a different place Himalaya is a part of this earth but it is notany specific place Himalayan Woods I just go from Rishikesh anything about it could be Uttarkashi it could be Gangotri Kedarnath to Yamunotri Himalayas is the closest place that you can connect to the otherworld so many Yogi is not just sitting there have met so many of them are so fortunate than actually my company Kala Pradarshan within the spiritual tourism and I remember in the initial to my research I just lined up in Himalayas I found so many peoples in that cold without ACyou know piece of cloth on the body using how is it possible and all these people still exist in the what we talking about the Gurus right now is ddos Gurus may be made in the normal situations the popular Gurus without so you hi sitting in the Himalayas today I'm talking about today's generation something that will just get a feel of just take a trip to Himalayas with an open mind of course this go then I'll come back and if you look at the autobiography of Mahatma is still there physical form or not seen it but many people have the experiencetalking to satguru's fighting the basic thing in all your travel plan an itinerary Himalayan trip and especially the Indian spiritual Himalaya part of it in Himalayan mineral go for the average part of it also Gayaopen to any kind of experience as a physical body will have any actual experience that you have anything that someone else is teaching of our spiritual perspective don't just this and say that it is not possible what you say you because you're not Experience At get remember that you only use 10% of your mind and the cell 90% to go Eastern Mediterranean Godown 90% Road spiritual growth to all of you let the great Lord their help you and guide you in the field of irritationspiritual growth to all of you let the great lot their help you and guide you in the field of irritation and Dr Radhakrishnan Pillai thank you I hope you enjoy the podcast I am coming from you thank you thank all of these books Found

35,Conversation with a REAL King - Lakshyaraj Singh Mewar (Udaipur) | The Ranveer Show 34,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s591oVQa1Bc&list=PLfNW_1ECVaThQynVe4QDlBM5S6Kzy8CeJ&index=36,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s591oVQa1Bc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDHmgAu5NNvMoVq7NwxEA37oy5D8A,is primarily so that you get the feeling of being the same room the podcast was recorded in this room was a part of the Palace in Udaipur the city palace is a palace of a prince called lakshyaraj Singh of Mewar I'm proud to say he is a friend now we became friends over the course of this podcast and might recent trip to Udaipur which is very kind of awakening for me I tell you why is a modern day Royal in India in 2021 your access to the best educationto your access to some of the best Minds will visit you at the moment in your life I also feel that prince lakshyaraj is an entrepreneur at heart when he was beginning his career he decided to move to Australia what is a Bartender work as a waiter worked at the lowest rung of the hotel industry so he could come back and run the hrh group of hotels in Udaipur that's the kind of mentality that he has in humble guy has a lot of respective is always hungry for more perspective and Godhot teach to the world so without further ADO film a conversation with a modern day Royal someone who kind of taught me a lot through the cause of this interview from this podcast I want you guys to learn about what it's like being a modern-day royal in modern india keep in mind in the city of Udaipur is the prince and people still worship him as a Monarch is not people surrounding him all the time is got an entire Palace to himself his got a whole army in a wave6 people still look up to him at the future king of Udaipur also keep in mind is a great humble guy his brother at heart so through this podcast through the Runway show I want to bring out the real personality of this man to show you guys that you know were so in people's lives can be this way as well a direct descendant of Maharana Pratap he was got a lot of lessons from his family lineage today tackle all those topics and we cannot change you to the episodethe Ranveer show enjoy yourselves come to the Ranveer show you guys today Mr king of Mewar Udaipur to get to know that you are a part of royalty and you understand the concept of royalty very late in life very very little of it my parents is a fabulous job in keeping us comein a state which I think was very very good thing we may have got a lot more flat from the outside world that what you mean for who you were absolutely no relevance in your mind of who you were as a young child baby didn't go to school obviously the others around you knew more of you then you knew of yourself so so the question was then so you didn't understand all of those things so perhaps dealing with the outside world who was a bigger challenge then beingbecause I think they gave us great upbringing and I really say that this is something which nature has a huge role to play in everybody needs to be grateful for who they are and what what they really are and at the end of the day as far as my identity is concerned I am very very proud of it and then it is something that you are to learn to live within the yourself or the people around you that school fees of yours when people were noticing that ok royalty among the school stories from then like or anything remember cool it used to be more like being thebenzene 230 come to watch and sometimes it used to be weird and sometimes it used to be fun because most of the time you didn't realise why they were reacting to you rather than responding to you aquarium in and like when you go and and you see something which is perhaps not a part of you and you have a reaction when you see something so you felt a lot like that when you are around people and then you got to know some people in the you got to make some of friends and things added as you say when you first walking to schoolpeople carry success by Christian andersen that you never knew at the early age of of life but in terms of being more cool I think from your perspective it I don't believe you but I do think that yes it looks cool but when you were my shoes when you go through the journey that you do and look at certain things in a certain manner they are not as cool and as Fairy Tail Din in terms of what the the film's may have done from from the inside and and that's something that you know you got to understand as you arethat part because I am a firm believer in the fact that the idea is not to go through life ideas to grow through life and in these are all the things that make you grow through life could you give like three challenges of a life that Aam Janata aur take for granted life example 1 suicide being being born is who you are and it being cool so that is something that has been taken for granted functions about people make assumptions that is the biggest thing ever in ke pass Sab Kuchh Hoga kis chij ki Kami Hai it's so cool decide Najar everything in all that they don'tthe largest part of their catching the short end of the of the stick second thing that you know your parents may be treating you differently and so on and so for trust me the scrutiny that they put our solitary I can tell you from my own experience that house tricks that they both have been and rightly so this is being stick does not take away their love or doesn't take their affection or doesn't take away any of that selection kind of bite into saying that they didn't lovers Point by the matter is being strippedreally had been noticed from our friends and all that around as per as negative way affected your parents are alike superstring exactly that somebody was driving without licence in your school of broader two wheeler now parents would allow us to do that you want to go to just pick up bike and just because your 12 years old and you can ride a bike or you can drive a car open take it in here are the keys because a lot of the children that came to school at that age for their own vehicles we also and backmost of my friends are bringing cars and bikes to school for the first in the US how older than the heavy licence but if they do then by all means you can take one then I found out that I learnt that at that age were not allowed to appear as I would just allow you to do some of those things are parents just didn't allow us to do any other things like this you know they were a lot of being things that were on the right side and making sure that you didn't disturb things aroundand what went well within your range and limits of things that you didn't and still within that you could enjoy your favourite third challenge it would be very unfair of me to say that in case there was any pressure against giving me the answer is a lot of people would think for me that there is a lot of burden and I completely disagree with that and I think if onehow to set out for the challenge then perhaps yes but the street that was thrown at you is a you must be and you so much pressure you must be and you so much for this and other and everything else that not not not really you know at the end of the day everybody have that kind of pressure but just to think that this person is constantly living underneath hundred tons of wait I think is perhaps an true So these are probably three things that come to my mind this point can I stop talking to the podcast and talk to your younger brotherplease please absolutely straightforward questions with all this how did you not become arrogant achi Surat ko sawarne ki jarurat Nahin Hai Saadgi Mein Hi Qayamat Ki Ada hoti hai so you know that's one thing as a Mantra that you always grown up with a knife and that's certainly not a makeup that you need when in a simple things in life are far superior and far better in explain DeepaNusrat Fateh Ali Khan qawwali line that I have stolen and shared with you exactly that you don't really need to put up make believe make shift throw your weight around to get recognised I told you know sometimes the ordinary things in life standout is extraordinary and one of the greatest things as humans that we do have is being down to earth being respectful to people and being one with them and I think that's the most beautiful thing and why not shareit do you believe in Karma and rebirth yesso do sometimes look around you and ask yourself what did my soul do right to be born you all what is a lot of the time what is the answer to that found one yet something on another one must have done to be able to do what they are doing now and I think everybody in the room so should be very grateful for who they are give bacchon ki Jivan Lekar is Prithvi per Paida hone Bhagya Ki Baat Hoti Hai Insan ka Roop Lekar Paida Hona Subah Ki Baat Hoti Hai Wapas been given this form of Being Humanmatter of eternal witness so outside of being around people to view as a royal king Maharana what would you call yourself an entrepreneur and administrative what do people give you wait is flowing in terms of its digital world in terms of everything else that is going around on this planet is a taglines and things are for convenience is of people are giveyou know you are you get up you do a job if you ask me professionally what I do and where I make my bread and butter from milk from the hotel industry so I have qualified in being a hotel yawa my degree in hospitality and tourism management that have a look at myself and other things that you do with interest us you to absolutely no I read your entire profile in detail and the one thing that stuck out to me during the appeal to me the most was this that you work at the lowestHotel industrial learnt it from that why won't you tell you what like it is an important life skill are you believe that if the opening a Startup for sweepers you to be a sweeper yourself but not everyone is an apartment Mini City gate no 11 is ready to go that Lo not everyone can eat featured at the beginning of the Journeys so what was your head right before you that step exactly that the till the time you don't do it yourself you don't know what is going to be likeonly the sugar knows where it ventures at the end of the day it's important to put on that you what you do know that everybody else is going to do when you didn't know that most Joy was such a lot of fun I can't imagine doing something and for it not to be fun within the industry or an area that you may have chosen of your choice so you know it's not something that somebody forced me into so it's not really come out as a surprise to work at the lowest level or you clean dishes O you watch toilets so I didn'tthese are the things that surprised me that you're asking that question surprises you that you know this is what was done but it surprises me that this is even a question in the first place because at the end of the day if you want to become something you need to go through a process night so at the end of the day if you want to do something you've got to follow all the parts you need to eat food so you need to go by their needs to be vegetables you need to clean wash and then willa complete processor same way if you want to achieve something in life you got to experience all of it at all levels and then perhaps go ahead with you when you do speak to somebody at that level when they are standing in front of you can look me in the eye and talk to them and not be because of who you are rather than what you have done with the reason why you are able to connect to the princess precisely and more than the experience is it the technical know-how and the skill of knowing what needs to be done you meincleaning toilet mein bhi very simple but at the end of the day that a lot of things that you may need to know to make sure that it's not harmful for you when is not harmful for the person using it so that is what is the most important in your own words could you describe the whole face working as a Bartender and working at the lowest so-called lowest face of the hotel industry is what interest to be very semicolonwhat did it teach you about life that you didn't know prior to doing that I think a lot of things that you just knew at the at the surface level for example dignity of labour right so when you were working at the lowest level of a new working as a Bartender know that you are always kind and courteous to people but when you actually went behind the the table or when you went behind areas were people did not see you when De De Pyaar Dejob it kind of give you a little bit more in-depth understanding of what it actually took from within and from the outside and the surrounding to be able to complete a certain task which was network take from within the fact of the matter is that you just took it as a very by the way you are always respectful and kind to them but they were Samvida job in the needed to do it but when you do it yourself it's a taste that only you can you can figure out how you can feel and understand that what it actually means when you go in there when you do a job you make a drink water glassare you put things back I know that entire floor teaches you in its own Accord in to be able to explain it is somebody could have then I have had to do it but the fact of the matter is that when you follow a entire process is when it can to explain to you and make you look at them with a lot more dignity and a lot more respect so up because you've been a batsman who I am going to tell you one Paramilitary somebody considered to be because you when a batsman I keep telling my close friends who have not been able to keep in touch with the yaarsetting kar lo life mein nahin businesses I am trying to Southern I think that I need you in my life that I am a little busy but I will come back to the dressing room Monday and I see that in your quality of very busy you doing a lot of things possible in this phase of your life so you took up this gives a Bartender work in the hotel industry was it with this intention of returning your property into a top quality Hotel it was it with an entrepreneurial ambition at the end of the day father was already running a very successful business and so the idea was to put your shoulder to the wheel andwhere my inspiration came into lean towards hotels in US when you grow up in that environment when you see your father do the the job and be very hands-on himself so you know subconsciously at that point in time in your school holidays this sort of thing starts sinking in you don't realise this but subconsciously they start thinking in your mind the role of this is fascinating and this is interesting and so on and so far so the idea was to be able to really come in and help somebody who was already so passionate about certain things andthat's where you took on the journey from and started to understand the nuances and integrity is of how to build and how to understand so you could communicate with people at the level that they are right without killing and without causing any harm to another physical being used some way I look at yourself as a Warrior Within your Rajput Heritage kicking in an entrepreneurial audio Bakrid wishes truth Aata Hai vah Veer hota hai aur jo Shastra Tyag Deta Hai vah Mahaveer hota hai answer is within20% really think but I can tell you that I am deep into spiritual reading and the special school I go to all the more reason you should associate with this line but the ki promoting the idea that you can get past any talents in life if every single day wake up the mentality a body of that would killing anyone of causing any challengesI think one doesn't need to be that Harsh subconsciously also ok so I don't think that one needs to take things of life of a day to day challenge of an office or entrepreneurship or working at the level of being a warrior in all I think very much so you can just be something which is very simple and the ideas to dispassionately on associate yourself and look at things for what they are andcomplicate things that itself is Indus OS 7 is sometimes let your guard down in your letter of weapons down but that doesn't mean that you let your situation awareness come and once your situation alea where you can deal with a lot of things very peaceful so and as I say you know hear the ideas not to prove the ideas to improve and I am not here to go live in school ke are you know thank you for participating you get a certificate in school or thank you for participating not here for participationthese days what we really need to do to overcome all of that and to make sure that you are able to run things in a certain manner is that you need and what is happening of what I see around me is 99% participation and 1% involvement what you need to do is 99% involvement and 1% participation rate that only more when you look at things on the outside is participating when you become the thing yourself then you are involved and that's what you really need to do so once your in worldthings then you know you don't need to go to the extent of being a warrior in your mind of taking each day as as a box there are 8 days and there are challenges when you need to be a warrior that when life throws certain things that you at that point in time you really need to kind of thing that intensely but on every day basis I think there is going to be a Burnout because that level in your mind is a very intense level and you can't be a frivolous Warrior Warrior is a certain League it has a certainand the resultant intensity to it to be on that intensity on 365 day basis is a very high level of intensity are so you only pull out those things when you really need to be that what has been your success formula for all the stuff you done now we've grown business is a simple formula that I followed is called ggn ok so it stands for greatest good greatest number so in life when we are trying to do anything the philosophy is to be able to dothe greatest good for the greatest number possible to the first us anything it may be so it's not subject of bound down to humans God its intangible and you know and is very situation and its unconventional so when you're not going to try and put it into a structure to Fabric to it in all that you are applied on the moment so for example like now the idea for me ifthis talk with you I am very thankful to you for taking the time and coming my intent for this is that it needs to be the greatest stock and at the end of the day with your number of followers which one will be very jealous of the same time very happy in all jokes I don't mean that is that is for the greatest number that automatically if you have to apply this formula usse ki applied now like what you have been doing which is fantastic to make it more relevant and to make it more explainable so this formulafor me in this moment how what am I doing trying to do now is to talk to you in the greatest and in the most honest and the most transparent manner that I can I say that would be the greatest good for me and through your means it's going to be true for the greatest number that brother Mod now yes and I'm gonna ask you this Akele kar very self-aware Gai write any one of my lovely family is listening to this early somebody is declared methat's on Record now going back to the first one in trying delete this will keep that you and your self what do you think is your weakness for selfish people also know the weaknesses like I said to you were here so the level of involvement I personally feel that to the extent of which I can pushsirf to be in Bolt I think I am probably sniffing out selecting out on that a little bit perhaps something a little easy or may not be taking things the to the boundary of pushing them as much as I could or should be able to do it snow in density than water Hath LG YouTube perhaps vs Wild that gets lazy to be very simple and very honest why don't you there is any comprehensive concrete solid Sachin someone just as you write myselfcal kar lenge that perhaps can reduce you know home again what I will people perceive as at the end of the day that tag of you know royalty and all will end of be with you for a long time so we will automatically assume that when you born into luxury you don't have permission but I see a lot of fire in US well and relatively allowed but when you are born intousually the first sad thing is what is taken right so that was the law that you guys to whatever is first side remain right now in life what is your ambition as at the age of 50 what is the best possible scenario for you as a person gets that's really too far to be very honest in at the end of the day I think it's very very important to be relevant and I think a lot of people miss out on doing things for tomorrow andletting go of today you know and that is a mistake I definitely don't want to make neck and usually in a log Hamesha getting Apne Bhavishya ke bare mein Socho beshak sochana chahie matlab there is no question of the fact that one should not we focus but the amount of time and energy that one puts in for tomorrow every day and the life that goes by for that tomorrow everyday once pretty much reach their end of that tomorrow before they even realise that they been able to think of their presentwomen have seen that happened to often and I N I really don't want to be like that person that string until that time to change its self and you doing nothing else but just going round and round in circles and when you look up after going round and round you listen still right there were identical begin from and life is already Knocking on your day those trying to say that listen it's time over now in a future seen so many people make that mistake I'd rather be nowrather be here in the now I'd rather enjoy myself and let my now have an impact on tomorrow rather than leaving the now and start thinking about the tomorrow it's the way you really think of things in a look nobody is saying that is right or wrong approach your perspective but each to their own people want to today think about when there are 50 by all means in office as a human they have the liberty to do it the they have the right to do it they have the ability to do it but I'd rather do something today which would let my ears 20 years from nowbe decided I'd rather leave it to my actions or today will be fair to say that the biggest advice of the world is focus on execution of your daily tasks today and then and than absolutely and let the time of the future be decided by the task that were executed today because that is also going to mature is not going to be something that would be executed in it good to have a result back into you in the next minut right that's also going to take a process is also going to take its toll is also want to take some time good or badthat's the call that you have chosen to make and inlet that call mature in that time to come and enjoy it having Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham yes you like them movie Amitabh Bacchan going right Chand write an essay families New Year's so that way when you are young adult us what values with your family to way they told you that listen this is something that will never leave like you know our families lineage so with that name of rights and yougive me something that my family told me in knowing you now in this little snow time will ask me explain it with a rather just get statement explaining how to build a house but the moment to ask that person ki bhai sahab aapane Apna Ghar Kaise banaenthe first response to kirae ke Makan mein rahata hun 2000 righteous people will never built house in their entire life themselves or know nothing about it but very very careful about the second chance that comes into this being is hukamchand they seem in their own mind and to the others who was slightly elevated from this Raichand peoplenotch higher these are people who give advices we just give orders kar dena Hukum Chand the personal just given order these are two chance that you be very very careful about the third Chand that comes in is the ancient things themselves and their rights and you know they are both fightinglet me open my own school and my own Pathshala which is gyan Binu so they will start coating the various books and so on and so forth Nani first thing you ask them ki Sahab aapane Kitni bar prayog Kitab ko Badi Nahin Hai per Maine Suna themselves to be the biggest gyanis of this entire Universe and they'll be the gyanchand of life IV Chandra to go to be very very carefulis the Hoshiyar chance who think that these three absolute fools and the only thing that one knows is me because I am the most clever of the lord I am the Hoshiyar Chand Re Chand Taare Gawah Kanchan do ghante Gyani Gyan Chand Baat Karega in sabka great Grand daddy is me and I am Hoshiyar Chand so he will be a mixture of all those three the fourth one so the idea is not to be any of the four ideas to be vwhich is Karamchand you do your business you do what you need to do and you be happy with it and let all these four live in their own delusionary world and not bother and you keep doing your Karam as they say near Jiski acchi hai Kismat uski Dasi Hai Karam Jiska acche Hain Uske ghar mein Mathura ka is that the advice Gautami family just in a nutshell if you ask me what does it mean explain it to me then this is one of the explanationso not to be any of these people but focus on what you need to what you need to do and be the Karamchand Chandra Bhanu padh Raichand gyanchand Hoshiyar Chand Hukam Chand Aaya Chand Ne Banaya Apne Ko Karamchand banna hai to Insan Apne Karam per Dhyan Den Apne maqsad per Dhyan De aur uske upar

it's a messthere is going to be passed in any family that is conscious of doing the right thing tuition yes but we don't have a floating on this planet for 1500 years so what is your life's most impactful 3 movies which had negative impact on your as a person is the first term is called Dosti second film is called Dosti in third film is called Dosti Ko shot in the sixties and it's a fantastic film Dostirelated to watch the famous all about friendship and tell you a lot of parameters and and teaches you a lot about life sometimes cinema does do good may not be all the time we want to learn the truth is now but but we are sometimes they do have a great impact on you and I think this is certainly one such film that in a Dent in a very ordinary man has an extraordinary impact so when you look around you and just ok Udaipur for now we look around you what you feel when you see Udaipura place where you can hear silence Agar Khamoshi ki awaaz Kisi Ko Suni Hi Tu Har Jagah what do you feel about your home exactly that it is home home is to everyone that at the end of the day of place where you can actually listened to silence and interpret what it's like to sell the place where you can

with your branded watchduring British X unfortunately my grandfather passed away before I was born so I didn't rice is one of my regrets of my life again some that is not in your control with any of the elderly relatives have spoken to them about constantly how things will be constantly on the first and foremost we were never subservient to the English so one of the areas that never came underneath the British rule or the moral so which is something that we Pride ourselves on that is our greatest wealth which is our self respect andI know that was something that was never for sale and was never given up at any any cost was not up for auction is so so that is the greatest thing that we were spoken about was exactly that they may have been floating around in this country but they were never able to have 100% rule on this country was because of a certain family that did not allow them to take over their particular place of whatever the consequences may be or whatever they may have thrown at a set that perhaps atpoint in time and with a lot of pride and help to clear a lot of cobwebs in people's mind through your channel is a factor of the first family too much in the republic of India as well be the first state to say that lets make a republic of India so which is something that we Pride ourselves also my grandfather my great grandfather had the opportunity of going to the Red Fort was in the national flag and declared in India independent that is something that you know we takepride in being able to share this beautiful country and its Heritage and its lineage with the rest of the world monex back then when India became independent who won completely willing to become a part of the role of the word history tells us on human level what do you think was thinking I am I am I am not them so to be very honest that was not something that we did they do we understand that we didn't understand it then or not it my four fathers understand their philosophy that hotSudhar opposed end and we don't understand it 70 years hence of India's Independence either because Maharana Pratap first battle of first fight was for independence for the word Swatantra was given birth to drink his famous for Haldighati is where the word Independence came in show me what has been wanting Independence for a very long time is finally came in in 1947 through different rules to the friend rains todaythat came from the outside and finally and independent India was was born which is all what we have always wanted to to have so you have kids now but if you could only pass on one Life lesson the orchids What The Life lesson be who they are known to be explained that exactly that just absolutely without me trying to govern their life for teaching them what to do the idea is that they are already intelligent we need to understand the fact that they areteachers we are not that teachers we are going to make them Daman by teaching them and today if we could open the school would open a school for parents of our age rather than sending these kids to school because they born super intelligent their exceptionally sensitive they are aware of their surroundings they know what they want a job is to be able to nurture and flourish them and help them 18 them to be what they want to be rather than from outside O you should do this invention to the solution to the don't from our vocabulary visa with themshould get deleted obviously one doesn't mean it in a manner when the standing somebody relief and not saying no to them otherwise the idea is that what they want to do in the daily life should just be really encourage 10th when you're certain time when you just let things be natural and don't poke and prod them they flourishment so you know when a human is young girl in general is a natural human tendency to be alamofire to remove hormones flying around you is there anything from your youth that I want says the great regretbut you that you look back and see if they may we should never thought that maybe should I upgrade my old already but that I don't think there is anything that I would feel that I have not gotten me just now yes certain things in life weight may have been featured on or at the weight and fold it may not have allowed me to do certain thingsbut there isn't anything now that one feels that one cannot do aur achieve or not willing to do with the experience that you have in this may again change dynamically a later 6 months later five years later depending on which point of junction of life that you may be at and agricultural shameless question Ok Please did you get a lot of female attention back in the day for being a princess king not believe this butbe confident of my family of actually Singh mm very very shy person I would look for in a round room which is which is absolutely right even if you did get a lot of attention that point in time in it just didn't and I went to an all boys school a Boarding School which clearly didn't help the question at and and and posted as a shadows are exceptionally a person and then you know as things progressed to Kinder understood thingsand differently in and all that but yes I think the prime time of 81 was the just looking at friends who were like you and would give you company to get too busy as a talking to yourself that you didn't have to talk to somebody else you introverted back them absolutely become this extra person that you are for the pure reason that a lot of people thought that no one was being arrogant one was trying to be rude but they did not understand the fact that one was just being shy and and it was a wrong message that was just beingdo you know this person does not to talk it is not sell or they think something else of being just being rude when is it was no way anywhere close to it was just really not confident in talking to someone that kind of give me the motivation rather than it being a disadvantage of the advantage that situation being very very negative towards me I thought might return convert that into into an advantage and try and do something about it and then slowly slowly slowly baby steps one thing at a time allowed you to to grow and not let that other personthat you are being ruled states that that's how you were to a lack of confidence usually arises from something that having your childhood or some images of yourself and your heads what was that for you overcame it was very comfortable my own company which are still I am ok so now you I am just able to divide the to better we will have to spend time with myself I still do that today but it would be at the cost of being rude to you if I didn't want to talk to you I don't know how to avoid you are now I don't know what toso you know you could get caught up in that it was now you don't get caught up in the atmosphere able to handle the situation is often need to be with you here and I need to talk to you and I need to be who I need to be and what I need to be the might as well do it and do it properly so that you know at the end of the day you don't hurt anybody is feelings you don't disrespect someone that is very very important I think an intentionally people were just getting the disrespected and they didn't realise that that was the that was the case so you just managed the two sides well-roundedmoney to spend some time with was only talking me to spend time with his life can do that as well and I don't need to run away from people I have the best of both worlds how do you spot bootleggers what is given me like someone is except you a very very easily now you know is just one of those things that you learn in a setting where you said you meet so many thousands of people every day from childhood absolutely what what was the formula there was no formula in of people would just trying to come and see if there is a lot of those techniques have started to change you have to keep up with the trainpeople do that job differently everyday you know so you ki Pathshala that I go to forget that experience for free completely not give us a view point from back side of the court that what are you saying bahut hi Bada hiteshi hun main aapka fan Ho Jo per aapane Jo Aaj Jo kapde pant rakhe hain vah aapke Upar theek Nahin lag rahe hain to give main sirf isliye kar raha hun Kyunkipata hai ki aap Street ko acchi Tarah Se Samjhe Ayenge Kyunki Main aapko bahut chahta hun so Sometimes this has two sides to do you know some time that may be absolutely correct or not known for my dressing sense at all and sometimes that this is got to do with somebody you know trying to say a negative to you to be able to get you closer closer to them to see more in this person is actually said something that other people who say they want to use that card to be able to present something that they would feel that usuallydon't say you got to be very conscious of the fact you know sometimes with people sitting with closed may just be having themselves and sometimes people sitting with arms closed maybe being actually closed now that is something you got to be careful of the fact that is it something that is it just an emotional physical touch to yourself or is it somebody who's actually being closed now that depends on your levels of expertise knowledge depth understanding to be able to perceive the situation and not jumpyou may be able to come out to a conclusion that we maybe maybe not so you need to perhaps prove that situation better but now with a lot of things an experience you are able to figure out most of the sun on all the stuff so you know you read in a book and there was a bad Mein Aise baithe ho ya vaise Baitha ho to it means Nation it means they say it's not a blanket like to have their arms around themselves and it is like to be alone feeling comfortable in and other cells and you know that something that we should be open to be able to seebut you do study body language to you by default a lot of these things that just the Antennas used go up in a lot of these things you just end end up noticing not because you want to but it just because you are I just got rained that we use the standard uniform in not be looking at something that is something spoken yours would just signed up on on certain things of these things happen when you are in a certain scenarios in spaceand it's teaches you from there on the flip side question what do you enjoy about certain people like why do you like ok I can be friends with this person exactly entertainment for freeexactly from former perspective of Summer is come up to you know keep you on the right side for the wrong reasons exactly that they'll come in start telling you star advice I think you are not really well yesterday and only telling you but ok I actually want to know the people around you is it the good energy use and from them ok theek haishort like that at all at the end of the day you got to be very very open you cannot be closed on this thing because you don't know keystore Hai pickup kahan on vyakti are Kadar vadakkekad and you need to not be looking at them and making the same mistake like they make for me and thinking of them that excess baggage in in mind otherwise if you ask me I am I have my childhood friends who have known for 30 years and I Hung out with them is there is really no that's that is one Compartment but at the end of the day does that mean that do I close the doorsthe world at work and that would allow me a meeting with you in I won't be sitting here with you being able to learn and understand how this world works in US would be closing my doors on a lot of things and I don't think that's fair for my growth and it is important that every day I think consistency is perhaps the worst that could happen to you means and and to not to be bitten by that bug it very important for you to be open or you will find all sorts of people but nobody is forcingyou got to rely on your judgement you got to be able to absorb understand and respect and appreciate what is coming to you to be had to choose not to choose it is a very end process so you don't agree with talking on netinx the 27th today 28 and Kobe Bryant passed away last night and was issued Idol for gift and it got me a lot of low phases of my own life my own career and one statement of his that stays with meyou set your own limits like everyone put themselves into brackets into Roop Singh and we can only reach your in life and your job as humans to consider break those barriers to message he left his world what is the message you only for your world if you know something wrong with happen tomorrow what is the given statement will be remembered for that I will let the world suicide that's not not for me to tell you know that's obviously going to be something that is going to come out of what I have doneso if it was to be that then I think the world is a is a better your teacher

Switzerlandlet's go to Pakistan is good for my carrier because its neighbouring country so we lived in Pakistan between 3 and it is 7 if any memories of junior KG in Pakistan school in Pakistan it is

applause for you to they have journalist they have worked on the highwayecosystem is the largest embassies in the world you are many memory of Pakistan house my parents have lots of memories of Pakistan and they have very very positive memories of their Pakistan face it this at Indian Embassy visa rebonded place nothing else to do nothing else to do known as I was really homeschooled I was homeschool to the first for yours joking with my friends these days WhatsApp statusgetting into play school at one and two years as like it is fine you know just homeschool them till 4 of IPL tone out ok so that was our memory of Pakistan and my mother has some very funny memories of dice spying on a sinner phones being tapped and you people was sort of outside our house watching over 10 years and they knew that we know and we had a kind of nice they would even just used to go answer that that iswas and I was brought up to my first language is actually Urdu and eventually you found yourself in Nigeria and that different countries in the world they take the world map in the rated from a to C A school countries like it leave the US and b is like average countries are you know that is NCS countries like Pakistan in Nigeria and super democraticpost to in a country the next country will be a b or C country and then it'll keep rotating so like we did Pakistan then he was awarded so to save in New York which is us a plus country after New York then you were punished with Nigeria that's actually how the way and its its interesting because as a kid that you're going to get a drastic changes because your moving from a country like New York where you everything which is so luxurious and New York in thelet it is a 97 this was a time when nothing you use to get nothing in India coming back from New York and there is orange packets of the tank am in my due to you to which characters for everybody write an original that anymore and then you move to a country like Nigeria where you can't get out of the house after 6 O'clock where your house has a bullet proof for many of your friends and family have been robbed at gunpoint it is nothing to do accept it morearmy photos of his kids life actually subject to a lot of extreme teenage teenage Facebook and YouTube and to talk you can't keep in touch with friend right innocent Snail mail to Nigeria it good to keep in touch with this life is that you don't have school friends so I don't have friendsyou also grew up with that but can it shows a super interesting place to grow up and out about this I really don't Envy my mum because I think I was 12 in my brother was 9 and Note 8 Pro buy clothes in it so if you wanted if I wanted a swimsuit Alaika prom dress and I went to an American school where you are these prom dresses and all she would have to go to this market call yawa market this cloth market value actually buy clothes Maithon and put a tailor in the houseand he would stitch every piece of clothing that you want interesting kind of child America add to the changestanding in line to get petrol that were people up to two drivers in Nigeria if you look at the start of the happiest countries in the world nigerians are constantly optimistic about life and I think that's something that I picked up a lot and comment mine told me the season leaders naturally have to be optimistic you can't have a pessimist inspire a team only the team so I think that was a really important learning thatI got from my Nigeria days out of something from each country developed in that leaves while using 8051 safe because I have heard stories about their little ones and he said he feared going to Nigeria on assignments and his attack even engine in America and he said that a friend of his when their land about the Lagos Airport is driver pick them up and take him to the hotel De to come into forest and then they found the driver was in the real Rider female Yahi made that guystook his watch to call you belong left me in the forest and drove away and any actual driver like this driverand that creates a sense of why do they have what I do they have what I have also there was it is an interesting thing that when you go to roam around in Nigeria you always wear a robbery Thulli even a Man a gold chain around his neck or drink or something so that if someone loves you don't get killed you can give your drink rather than your life I got magla stillrelatively safe five Gardens and its I am a water and all my life and on the phone with someone Walking Alone Manisha me something about business and walking stick and walked in the head my specs for low and my phone Falls off is well this guy I was confused back Nihar on the floor Vinod on the footpath and he picks the phonebike pics movie and change them I couldn't take that died and was the creepy apart of the story was in shock when file a police complaint online and immediately after getting mugged you have a sense of shock and you have a sense of why did that happen to me this is like last year when was established as a famous but everything is going well Sanjiv and mountthe next 2-3 days you realise ok but maybe that person just wanted that phone way more badly when I wanted to kind of start asking questions about life that why I can be a good person I have not done bad it to anyone but we had that happen me then you realise this class difference we all like you know even even in India why did not be as much as I did are there is that class division of people who are given a lot versus people were not I want to school in Philadelphia in the US andaur very unsafe Areas where is holiday marking there and if you come to this in you think about it it actually had a community of very poor people and then all these University kids and it's the same difference and you wonder why people would make a college kid because a lot of kids in Philly at that point on the point which you knew you would not lost life to make a college kid sings a great these people have come into our community and they have something that we don't have to sendkripya part of my story was later on from an anonymous Instagram account I got a message saying hey brother I am sorry I was the guy who wap to enter your phone and Instagram account was it had left 0 followers 0 whatever following it was just like an account made for telling me this that it was some fan who had like me and he said that this is your phone's it would've given the number and was actually the correct identification number I didn't knowI was too busy by that were not forgotten about making a night that moved on but it can I just change my whole perspective on Fame this concept of class difference but yeah it was like an eye-opening that's where I actually got fascinated about West Africa this is a youtubers a lock with a lot of Business and Technical Guruji is explain your difficult it is establishing and you thought for your friend who is scared to go there is an it professionalnumber as a product that graduated from Indian Institute and he said one of his friends go to college offer in Amazon $300,000 of an energy and asking for advice $200,000 of the offer was the virtual Life Insurance does that country other than giving you optimism we can I find a little finals train from the outside but I've never been an what does Nigeria give you about the importance of a community andcan be very individualistic arm so if you do get Nigerian we all had helped in Nigeria you know your help will run out of money by the 15 for 20th day of the month since you last 12 year you know where is the money she is like you know I hate my sister and other village so my mother after month after month and at some point I was told you have not real sister in Nigeria system in the anybody from your community because they believe that went off x come on themcommunity comes to support them great learning it is time I always tell people in financial services to build a sense of community around you it's interesting you know you haven't asked me this as a sort of grown up I realise that women are their community in most of the corporate world and when I Chashmah 2788 care about feminism I thought this hold the debate was quite a 50-50 that when the 50% by 60% girlsI am older actually realise importance of community especially being a girl and importance of building a community of women and standing up for each others this whole concept of sisterhood that I learnt in Nigeria it's now kicking in a very different was a scary statically might get slightly wrong but Kunal Shah the founder of thread was on the show recently and he said that in a Bin metros in bomb in Bombay Deli Bangalore80 to 90% of the women are just like sitting at home 25% for women find participate in the workforce I get into trouble for this shit but in my own industry we have 45 mutual fund companies in India with this is to some quick mad about 45 leadership role so head of the measurements 17 17 Oct so 45 x 5 means a speed 200 otherwise 150 senior positions according to the national 5 killed by womenit's not by the way that we do not manage money it's it's not that I don't know as a guide to 15 tables were granted because it's not really your concern you don't notice or leasing still you grow up may be with you will not ignoring you have women and men working Mother Teresa noticing this little things tracks and Society will likely the first end of reason I thought I should have you on the show I read 152 it's just delivered beforedeposit of video of basically Trump and Modi walking down this pathway and there's like in girls wearing Bharatanatyam costumes and one guy wearing this traditional Indian outfit that one guy is a kid and white outfit and goes up to Modi and photo and their lives it take to them and your caption on that was let you actually completeask for opportunities because nobody is going to do anything for you and the other thing about that photo is a while the kids tapping in asking looked expression of the Gods so lot of people told me and that's saying what is the girls don't want the photo answer is looked expression with almost at Miss India moment like I can't believe he got it well my point is why did he get it he asked and you know what the girls were first onlinethese women sessions in the keep asking your what's your advice for young girls just ask for opportunities ask for the big promotion if your computer into something ask I think you know on every day for women is 8 out of 10 is public or at herself 608 herself 11 study my friends who are consultant at Bane she sent me this exact than actual study there actually asked a bunch of women this an exactStreet dancers lower than the capabilities and most guys rate themselves and might be suicidal condition in genetic condition and I don't know what it is and asand told stock liable to be told not to look and say thatas I want to in a leadership position what you understand about women in your workforce is that the add completely different dynamics to the same projects kam Batman even men have their own your good things are the other products in the same goes for women and the best organisation always contain according unique mix of Management but piprauli far from that adds valuelove someone who is a physicist for someone who is a lawyer versus someone who is an engineer they will all have different perspectives and I believe organisations should have diversity of edu can't have 30 Euro 50 year olds in no young population so it's not just the engine is one form of diversity in diversity of everything better award how you overcame the gender by sage by all these things but before youyou went on to the Corporate Park you also had an entrepreneurial side of things and before that you are in Wharton Android after watching you had an extremely dark phase of your life with interface but so what what after Nigeria what happened to Italy which is where I did my high school awesome place by the way like the best places on earth and then I think the time I was in 10th 11th visiting thatI want to next and that is in the government form is winner teachers so what would it be that your personality I think I think I like my foodevery stone that theories in a country because they have a very rich heritage on this celebrate so you know it is home of espresso and cappuccino and being a coffee when you love this but you know this Starbucks in it right italians are not going to let Hotel then there was interesting and let some random American company what can walk all over their culture they make it harder when they make stuff there was something no there in the celebrated insometimes we can lose touch with it teaches you to celebrate your Indian so you should be proud of speaking your Hindi and walking around in your study and celebrating your Ramayan and celebrating your Mahabharat Mahabharat celebrating your you know culture and I keep rocking the one at one point in time I have a secret desire to be the tourism minister of India and this comes from living in Italy I just believe we have tremendous heritage of tourism in this country India should be the best place or notalbedo terrible for organising and 100% with myopia in 20 years time if I am in politics in any way that 1 department of which to clean up from your personal perspective we can make money off of tourism soft power is your brand and its business and celebrate literally Every side so that that that that the table questions opening ofyou telling me how these things but but ok let's come back to your story like what did you what was your intention behind going to Wharton I and I guess I have fix ank my mother big issues super aspirational formations like you should apply abroad and wouldn't have government doesn't pay you very much money and a college education is expensive$50,000 a year then something for yourself Like I Remember seeing it like a crore papa at that point in time is a big amount of money in our world and I said let's only apply to the places where I will get scholarship and you know the big schools don't give scholarship to give loans in financial aid my mums LIC apply to the best in the world and why don't you just try and it was because I actually got and what I got in with financial aid which is the college Counselor told me that if you awhat is a normal candidate you have one in718 chance of getting him to apply and ask for money also to support your education your 140 chance of getting and it's like their way of saying ok don't do his wife and two thingssitting in Italy wouldn't have very much of that it on a lock with root Asus from the heart and that was it and I always used to tell her that your mum I am not an athlete and I don't have anything I can't play any music background on what's the worst that can happen you won't get in anywhere you go to India that's actually how I got into collegewish I will get location at your head because I mean a lot of parents so ok I love you my perspective and my mum is Gujarati education through and educationyou right now considering applying to Riley college she likes up she will be having that happened in lifecan change your life I don't think it can change your life because of the four years there are only and sitting in classes Amit classes a good enumerate world-class professor in the community of people that you get exposed was incredible for studying wicket from all around the world and that is and provide a global background of studying with kids from all around the world is very different from traveling to your holiday I think it's two very different perspective I think you always taught to lekin amfree hai so you got that you have to be alone no that you have to push your mind and I think that's that It stays with you even when you are 30 and 40 and the most powerful thing it does is it gives you an alumni network so his head alumni club here we have about 2,000 alumni from my college in India and would be connected to each other they always be holding the top jobs in the countryin my case it interesting my husband's I met my husband in college and all out close friend also managed friends from college so we have this group of about 5-6 Awaaz couples in we meet every weekend and we just look at and now you know I am in some of the mausi use of listed company and people have done very well for themselves but being bonded by the rules for your very intellectual cannot be not actuallycollege kids founded by an experience when you were 18 19 20 21 I just think that changed my life give me a lot of confidence I had to dive into my top out through it give me a lot of the exposure and confidence that have today you know I always try finding polite ways to ask questions previous question ask articles about you are you even consideredsomething like suicide like so what had happened in that face after you had so much perspective 1 review that thought process and professional project on campus placementcalm down I think that forces brings out the best in people I mean it makes you unnecessarily competitive and its dogi Tok world and I always feel that I had never face detection because also my life I was like a good kid class topper in the only in security I grow up it was around my looks because of my neck issues and my way to showabhi location to beautiful beautiful how do you turn off this will I know this is kinda stuff so if you see you all that coupled with rejection I think that's what so I got rejected from a bunch of Consulting interviews at that point 37 in ago and got rejected I rationalize this latest so when I got rejected from the seventh one and I decided to try and jump of the 19th floor of the buildingnot even issued Consulting for irritated me it was the fact that I got rejected the friends of mine who I thought it was great got the job it's like that dialogue heroine 3 Idiots give Khud Ki Har what happens if youwhat and who prepares you for failure at any point in time so that was my first out of here and on what is the minimum so you sat through many hiring drive yourself what basis during the rejected you want I don't know and I found it to be a part of a conversation right and it's not like I have been rejected after that it was a knife handle it much better believe that rejection in some way is redirection to a better placerejection romantic rejection this could be college rejection this could be rejection from you know I am in your going to book hotel in you didn't get it and you ended up staying at another what I mean it just it could be rejection am in any kind of rejection I was applying to college I thought it was my dream school like I want to be an engineer not all that I didn't get into MIT in retrospect I think they rejected me because I was not the right fit resources Consulting form rejectedI was not the right fit or someone else was a better fit the needs and I ended up at McKinsey which was great for me so I always think rejection could be just what we are saying I know you are meant for something else that's a better fit for you but you are not taught how to handle rejection 2019qualities in Nigeria USA Italy had experience is there was lashing to head I really worked very hard I want to what no scholarship which was very rare I can survive this how can I will get the seven times one time is ok but how can someone be rejected 7 times after being topper of class going through all of these beings super Singhabout everything goes to your head how can they reject me my best friend that time who most people do not my husband today you sitting with me and he just call the cops like this girl is ready to jump out the window do something and that's when the cops came and it took me to this mental Asylum this thing that existed on campus and then I have to escape andmy father was in the country code Zombie at that point I had moved to Zambia from Italy calling with three in the morning Singh Papa I need to get out of this is how you'll end up there in the first place at anoboy I was trying to do this and a boy I am asking the same question that whitestory would you give got my am sorry undeletable did that that had any layout your personality this coming I got my final after that and relaxed I was sick so I had a job offer at Microsoft and then I wanted my last interview at McKinsey office leave in a good week and I figured you stop taking yourself I seriouslycscs to take life seriously come down this is just not this dramatic about everything that happens in life I just have to cool it my husband always says your stop and smell the coffee stop and smell the roses just come down that could happen to you get rejected by 7 consulting companies at Microsoft that's not it so it started seeingthe other side of life and putting my problems into perspective and I think that helped it's not that I don't knowlife would kill somebody it working like I can't do this my team struggling me on having some person from it's not like I don't go through bad faces but I've had the ability to talk about rather than just internalize it and I think that helped so that was problem while lowest mental health face I think the last 3-4 years ever since I have discovered the power of photo sharing my story is being vulnerable and realising that Iperfect have been really good for happiness and confidence for corporate career at the Trail Blazers that is one of the corporate career is less glamorous then it is made out to be in your so I try to jump off right for this is my first opposite vacancy it is like top Consulting firms in the world now when I joined vacancy as like very sad I would be a strategy consultantthis conference room and come up with like Strategies and a white smoke is going to emerge as just for the listeners to determine what a consultant dost consulting companies advice corporates fortune 500 companies large companies on various parts how to turn around the day 4 how to change their operations is basically a problem that a company could be going through and a higher Consulting company because they have got expertise Singh many different companies Consulting company doespeople excited about two girls at a very early age give you exposure to different businesses different problems and you think you actually want to sit and advised so you think consultant on somethingtreatment of Croma Electronic retail phone and it was in a city called Houston Texas where is no better Italian food and my job is to go to this electronics store and started phone in the morning and follow people around in the store and just catalogue on a pen and paper what they were doing from four in the morning Hilton at night and I was what is I try to jump off a 19th floor of a building for this and that's how my call tractorthis is an entry level jobs and not what they are made out to me and it's not just making the mechanism great employer you need to go to the top grinder nobody is going to give you the range of the company and se solve my strategy and tell you don't know anything so the first thing I learnt my corporate career and I always tell younger than the don't expect the first two three years to become a very very very basicyou always start life at the bottom of the Totem Pole again like there is a Totem pole you just start life again at the bottom of which is the biggest of problem in BC and hiring even for the media industry today will have some very talented kids who will severely lakh patientsgood because it is your analytical ability teaches you to understand retailer teaches you to make mistakes and go wrong no and second hand over your company to a 22 year old kid on the first day at the mean you can't make it is a young person and you have to go through in life and a lack of patience and a lack of the ability to sacrifice things can literally photo stop on your career growthIntex satellite 10 at night and I would sit in the warehouse in start crying and have been what am I to I can I will tell my parents about this was embarrassed that this is my role but I didn't realise it was the right thing for them to do in just me it happened to everybody right you just go through the bride for your jobs are like that I get better and better and even nowrandom stuff that doesn't appear glamorous that's not very fun but you have to do it before the journey began I'd like to call you a multi-billion dollar so I have to sell myfirm and ending Bottle by someone else so I always say that young people have a little bit of Hungary and foolishness in them again try to rationalize why this so I did the consultant and then I walked on wall street for a few years great your visit in 2006 and 708 which is like most what you see in the movies is true about Wall Street of 2004 World extreme but think like a big shot at 17elements I was actually trading mortgages that was my first Wall Street so very selling loans to people who had no income no job no acid silicone gel on that point I am so if you don't have a house take a loan fromsmart people watched it has a ton of was and I have an interesting conversation so my dad represented India from the 70s to 2020 Year 2015 when he retired perception of India globally has changed completely and he said this when he retired is like to keep telling his new market mutual funds for a living rice old India for 11 years to so beautiful thing is VIT CSE in the kind of respectablethe seventies which among us and German counterpart I don't think WhatsApp him very much at that point in time and from the land of thisnews about sanctions on acid that point in time the TOEFL test happen and by the time my father tired India had gone through and become an economic superpower so the kind of respect he got from the German ambassador of the Japanese Ambassador changed totally and that the reflection of Wall Street to so I think you are economic standing is date of perception is 300 perception is Indians are very very smart table people are very personal selfish levellife is to change the perception of India as a creative capital of the world and artificial intelligence capital of world because I do feel that in designing artificial intelligence products they will be of use requirement of Creative and that my that's the phase of life I want to begin at 35can still do a lot more while people are not very hopeful about India's future but I will be heading and good faceolder than 8051 in the sixties and seventies there the presencetotal always say talking about optimism that I don't regret it all and the reason I don't regret it is is the US is Sachin evolve place is a great market most problems have been solved have to do things that a third order to make your I think with what you are doing what I am doing this so many people we can cater to and we can do basic things and solve a lot of problems you can make a tremendous impact yourI don't think you can make in a market like the u.s. right but I'm really resonated what you are saying at the age of 27 days 22 it was my alpha ego kicking in 72 hours working in this country and not a second class citizen can be true like adventure in the USbut that brings me to my question on entrepreneurship what was that Gionee like starting your own business because I have seen the allowed me to try transitioning from the corporate world into the business and I'm not generalizing I have seen a bunch of people who can't we keep up with the world of entrepreneurship because for example in the world of corporates if you eat a banana you want to submit the dustbin can you in the world in the world and Entrepreneurship if you eat banana does not display in the throw it into it by the dustbin yourselfUS to India transition I think employment entrepreneurship is a very big transition especially when you're young I will say I was a super arrogant like Wall Street kid how do you 24 so and 24 is not young for start a person with a little ground for financial services start a person because we are a great here and here we like rear right it is business of fast answercan you show but a white light shows content on the notion that was very fascinated with the world of contact you loved watching television as I want to get into this business award show people visuals that why does content and media as my domain what initially due to finance because on the outside it can seem boring to a lot of peoplerising that create write an ALP to find your passion in life is to good student who went to a management school and it happen to be a finance and management central school now that had never had a corporate career for me to know that I so if you want to ask me did you want to do Finance in this was right on some of us just start in careers and we grow to lover Carriers as it's almost like arrange marriage rightfind a life partners in which use them in Innova fall in love in the we get married but some people in a lot of this country has arranged marriages and you marry someone and it works and I think that's my case and now and stayed in the profession for 15 years because what would things about finance is that you are constantly learning something old what is the date you are you say so I just ask him that listen to have lots read you have all the money in the world where are you doing this at age ofthis is the only profession in the world where you always have something new to learn everyday because either you should be making money every day every day and that's what I love about itopen bank account and you have hyper rich people who know what to do the capital markets that is constantly evolving so you have lots of people where you can make a tremendous impact and its its most heartening thing in the world to have someone say You know what I did in SAP and I'm so happy and wasted in mutual funds and I was able to pay for the surgery your do something like that of my dreams were able to come through and ultimately be in the business of money managerwe people's dreams come true people invest and people safe and they make dreams come true whether they are a vacation or a business or whatever it is so that's very rewarding profession that is the stimulation and the ability to help the people is the joy of women Independent and enable how to start your own business you know you could change the financial fortunes of a family so deep office I think it's not Wolf of Wall Street was not the evil industrymedia makes us out to be also not like the trial was not like the glamorous like that girls all around in this 5 rich life most financial services professionals are actually very few top fund managers who manage money click fund managers who manages your money to give me money by the responsibility of itseasy for me to manage my own money but when you give me money to manage stress your responsibility that thousands and relax of the people who are responsible for so I think that's also another via our is a word in our industry called fiduciary what fiduciary means your responsible for someone else and I think we live with that responsibility everyday I sometimes think people don't understand that so that the stimulation by a bit but he was itseating enough for you deserve can I want to start a business analysis business can be a very brutal game so I was an investment professional right as you said there are lots of other things that happen in running a company that you have no idea about when you have a corporate career and I think there are so many things that you learn want you run a business for instance if you run out of money management business someone also stood on the office and administration someone owes to accounting someone also has to hire people someoneVastu marketing and PR are regulated Businessman also has to do legal and tax now in the US someone else is doing it for us when we started 3 hours partners and so it was you husband me my husband and I thought partner was a colleague of mine in the US all three of us had only investment background somehow I became the person who decided to leave investment into everything else so I remember setting of our company with Registrar of companies and going to the arrows website in filling the name and I remember applyingPAN card in fighting with it guys are so why are PAN card is not come and opening a first bank account which state bank of India two wheeler teaches you that listen your incorporate India ownership can be like it is department Amazon mostly when you call someone at a call centre is like this is not my problem when you have a business everything is your problem right and I was the ones in fact on get into trouble for saying this will come from the US so we didn't realise you have to have a sign in hindi and marathi on the outside of the companyshop and Establishment Act notice in my name is this is also the stuff that you have to manage and I am so grateful that it is today in AC used in Toronto only look at money management you also manage marketing you also manager office you also managed a chance to spend more time anything at all and all of this in my phone from capital state so I was very well prepared but the basic product was that you take some of the money and help them take care of itManagement Service which is basically that will take someone's money rich people's money and help them manage it a second product was something called an alternative investment fund which is like mutual fund for the rich so it is more sophisticated in terms of what it can do then our mutual fund problem you need more money to invest in this then you would 1000 rupees minimum which I managed to de do for set of products how do we better part of the money and give it to youminimum that's ability to take from a client in a Portfolio Management Services 25 like so that we started with and would go to friends and family and se please yours money and it was believed that when you what can return Graduate Level 1 waiting to give you money that I will be greater nobody cares but does every Wharton graduate or every I will graduate have that capability actually x 25 hackslike they are good enough and strong enough to money management is is a very basic profession I think a hero is a profession that involves understanding what is a good business and what is not a good business arm and whether or not working graduate I think if you are a strong thinker if you are disciplined about your approach if you know what is a good business you will be able to do it so I don't forget that difficult and industry and its different industry in terms of temperament sothink my husband says because he is also a money manager is that this is a career where every week is like a report card come out on the film industry because you doing badly for a month for two months and people start you know questioning the last 10 years what you done so that since temperamentally is a very difficult business and Markets move up and down and you know we live in like a social media and noise induced world so this so much noise adjustment ayena temperamentand have conviction that I like this company is going to do well I don't care about what other people say I think the temperamental it your money management is pretty underrated most Portfolio Management services in India like because I know a lot of our listeners actually think of their life with that target at some point I will definitely invest the pm's that's just how young people think has influences like myself basically a PMS firm in India what do25 lakh so that they have done that is it all stock market is a mixture of FD stock market in Indiastock market you could have one that is partly stock markets and partly that markets you could have one that is just doing safe instruments important to understand what the objective of what you are getting into a is like you could have health podcast or you could have your food podcast for your music and one negative people often would not from the financial world get intimidated by these words like European mutual fund industrylol this is very basic and simple but all these things are very whatever mam Singh if your not understanding it was this podcast pause this YouTube video go Google it and come back andwhat cars were trying to explain people the basic principles of investing through Ramayan which is a very homegrown kind of thing we releasing it we add next week with finding is Kabaddi as a medium to explain one of our financial products also tried to simplify it because I agree we have too much login23 concerned about money and the bigintimidation factor was this that I didn't understand what my wealth managers were talking like and then I had to stop them at tractor taken my phone Google ok Kolhapur friend used in finance is a broken please explain the selection board is always a simple way to explain it absolutely but it's the Challenger your industry faces as a whole is notarm and out of recklessness or lack of knowledge and it's ok if you make them in your 20s you meet the man you are not wearing something you have your life to on writer is better to start learn investor little bit make mistakes hopefully in 5 years you learn something and you'll learn what should you possibly right and you do ok to make mistakesfinancial mistakes are being spoken about by someone who created an extremely successful financial services business and then got bought over by a devicesecond just placed in the listeners that I'm getting the business model your resume and a sum of money at the prophet you make that when you take a cut from the sun also again so you manage someone's money in youth a small fee for managing that money is it will 8.2% is typically the fee sometimes in some products you charge something about the prophet so like if I make 15% then I'll take something that put the basic money that we make is a small Power Bank charge is called a management in our business with a fixed fee for managing your moneyTitli 8.2 % to your money got that we charge but then what would happen once you got your family and your young kids TV channelaata hai vah Bakta hai abhi is visible actually said she is like to have to promote your brand you have to go out and build up and so I remember going on LinkedIn talking to open your TV channeltime we had a total of 2 crores he gave us another to cross and he didn't know was and he just like to put we had said in the media that's actually how we got there and then the business grew from there if it's it's unfortunate but he died three months ago in the locked earth but he remained an investor without root and yours you did not read about this is please go follow on Twitter you are one of the reasons that I see that a new wave of Twitter happening in the countryentirely political not through it is one of the easiest ways to grow your mind is a very underutilized tool in the modern day was discovered a source of vitamin getting so much for me and I just think that people complain a lot about Twitter but if you look at the positive side of Twitter Twitter has liquid young brand is totally democratize Amit in the earlier daysthings about having big budget Satra now you can have good content in Twitter gives you reached as an individual and as a brand so I love Twitter and you know if 5% of people are trolling me in its ok its all good modern life hack you just need to learn how to embrace the concept of Rolling alien life and you will be able to tell you where to watch offlinecontrol centre of the new modern human experience it is all I actually have fun with them and do not talk to them but I have fun reading rolling into being trolled in the corporate world by older guys why did advice by you guys out like what does a big company like a device receiving a privately owned company and select ok we need to buy these people is it that they want to buypeople like you that I want a Radhika Gupta to work at the see that they see all the report for your managing and and andthe little people think these Billa done only for the money and you know you sell your startup for exercising I can promise you when you know you said that you want to talk to a device you know and work for them out of college the reason we picked a device was the brand and the culture in you have to find sequential services businesses or not food business is why you just said it and you walk away they by the business for the founders because the expect the team will have gone now if you are a group of peoplewhat were the company after word for primary criteria is tourism place I want to walk away from marriage rather than a buyout absolutely I said this again and again when I did the deal that it's a partnership is not an acquisition and you know people always effect when the soul the business people kept saying the good to eat you alive corporate India's only because this was our first time booking in Indian companyin fact the partnership of for your partnership after which you know my husband and I could help you don't we haven't put on right we stayed on road on things I like about edelweiss and this is very rare anything we get after that is it's one of the few financial services companies in India that really cares about young talent most of the sea yours are super lotto cos-1 the 3548 this countryI got this opportunity when I was 33 so you have to give something to people during this on your 33 it's always been a passion to do something they know that the good advantage of young people is the passionate and they adapt to change so if you are a Challenger brand you have to be someone who is open to changing right you have to be someone who is like ok I don't care what anyone else is doing I don't care ofsmall I am just go out make a mark so I think that ability to adapt and change in young people is something that they like to take a button and because this already me I have the confidence to our young people in my teams like I know like you and I don't send humidity and I hate doing this to you but I read of very very interesting sat about what happenededelweiss after you to go could you just share some of those just like that number with us about the many billions of dollars that your managing now and what are you doing phone 2025 super so fun and we have an industry of 45 mutual fundsrank means that this every quarter and there is like a lot of social media hoopla about his life so it is a very big table of test industry on 36 which broke into the top 15 this quarter which was super excited about nrc news manage six thousand crores of money which is a little less than a billion dollars and we problem manager little less than 50 thousand crores of money in the last few years 6000 to 50000lokpriya aspiration is knife set this in interviews that we want to manage 3 lakh crores also ask you know what's the strategy to get to 300000 rupees and I don't think I have not so that I don't think you need to have answers that even a6000 I don't think I had an answer to how will get to 50,000 I didn't know that from 6 to grow this business to 9 and 10 and grow to 15 so life is a series of small steps taken dailyyou take the small steps in Hindi with more confidence develops into a little bit of luck also comes into play a few opportunities come in you grab them when you know Lo and behold you karo so is eating outside college kids we don't know what does 521 do every like do all the companies have different roles for SC and to what doeslife as a few and tell me what do you do I watch your daily work or changes on but I am unfortunate that you are always in my father old model of the Seoul being intimidating in itself I don't thinkside of the team and its Jo one among equals and see that you know organisations have is designations its role playing rules but the so is I think a few things when you lead a team and I think I spent 50% of my time doing Achar by the way I Di little easement 50% you think it is the easiest thing to do to Hai Avengers smart people and you just assume they all work together if you have to wear glasses that is humanitypersonal issues sometimes you just be sitting in meeting the only way you are not technical contribution that is technical expert in every department derived from just there to facilitate two people working together on their motivated team and then tell them that they can do it right away people.in Aisa Kyun understand this while we are also Carriers of the brand is you know in your CPU is Mutual Fund your responsibility is to carry the message ofmutual fund everywhere that you go and make sure the people sing the highest bottle voice mutual fund I like wake up everyday thinking like I represent the brand and I have to be the best ambassador of the bride of this is my father I am best of India it is type is title all these years a best of India and all his life is meant marketing India and making sure the people thought the best about India and I think of myself as an AmbassadorI think that's the second rule that we do and then of course you know you do a lot of routine staff and you manage business and you make sure the company is profitable and all that stuff happens but first you are the leader of people and you are an ambassador of the brand and also likebelieve this on actually I have over time I realise that I think it matters because you know it's one thing to have thoughts and in India I don't get as much about what it's about convincing a large number of people that this is what if I say tomorrow we all have to wear T shirts because that was going to be good for the complete about convincing everyone they have to wear a t-shirt tomorrow and making sure that every day t-shirt tomorrow that is communicationyou have to be an optimist and has to be communicated to lift people of inspire them what would you like to tell young girls watching this telling 8090 so it starts with u believing that will be SEO in fact you not think that irritates me on inspired me the most funny interview fresher candidates is awesome look what you want to be in life and then there's a your item to your manager I want to sure that you want to hear thisread a long time ago as a kid that if you're in for the stars rule reach Halfway through so if you're an aim for less than a so if you want to be a cricketer you'd always within I want to play for the national team nobodyambitious is not a bad what is a girl and I also think told me my money is a common friend and this is also something only learnt after starting my own businesses and like to learning about professional life through people like yourself with a beautiful continent is something you Mukesh Ambani assert himself is said that it took my dad Dhirubhai Ambani maybe 40 years to build out his legacystrawberry Tumi 20 years to build out a much larger Legacy and it'll take my kids 10 years to build a much larger than 120 years and the reason for that is India spectrum and the number of people that have some young people underestimate remember being in Engineering College and always had the same question that via these people living following life like a and I had that prospective fortunately because of having a lot of business Savvy friend outside of Engineering College Valsad interesting BBA who are running thetalk much more them as they have the disconnect engineering college friends and I asked my business services in engineering Oz you send this with all these are the people avoid the evening solo and they told me that this cultural and breaking they've been told that your in Engineering College you better have a stable job at the end of it and that it is mehnat karo Naukari mil Jayegi settle Ho Jau status game the parents won't be able to tell their friends that oh my kids got a great joblugaya ki shaadi bhi theek ho gai hai Nahin to have kids and all that but why it is starts by aiming really really this is definitely an Ivy League education it forces you to am really really it is not thinking that you are the best in the world right 36 is that the league table can call your anything that's realityand if you think like number 36 in your head always get number 36 business and Entrepreneurship and that anything is possible and sometimes you knowwhy do you think there's no chance that I am good bye have to get this you why would this come to me why would I get this and it just happens if you wanted a man looks so don't judge me for that I am total Shahrukh Khan fan of I am and I actually really believe that whole dialogue about Agar Kisi cheez Ko Dil Se Chaho to actually the world conspires to make you to succeed my my my reason for choosing thisand not creating se comedy content or light weight and content if that I want to breed entrepreneurship in India I want to see my mistakes on a shared the fire bless Unborn a lot of iron I just wanna put it out of the world and you know if there's ever a 100 billionaires of the world list on 52b from India and I want 49 to we like this what to name but it is the sum of odd one out and got some 125I really hope so I want to any five of them to win I wanted to be a change through the podcast and I'll tell you why again this is concept I read about a lot for this concept of matriarchal society is I believe that Bhutan is a matriarchal society Kerala and it does it have been to the Northeast and spoken to menDragon societies again I will get it from this because of you know in the India does have it section of people who do not believe that all why do you think a matriarchal society is good for your let you take the answer for some then I'll give my own perspective it is explainedChinese and simple words to build this is where women play a strong role in society I think you mentioned Kerala in the Northeast I've also seen this my mother-in-law Hills to Mangalore and the advantage of a matriarchal society and medical Society of lifting women is it only if the woman you lift a community and when you leave the community to lift the economy was given the get liquor storehome in Israel country was developed after World War 2 way they had used from all over Europe and all the all the word settled into it but it didn't even so they did this very interesting thing where they need Hebrew compulsory in Hebrew was like De Sanskrit Sanskrit dine out in India it is coming back gradually like people get interested in Sanskrit again but he was entirely dialogue and the government did notBaaghi 2 complete the made compulsory for everyone to 4th standard but all the girls till 10 standard because the girls would become mothers and duties and our families that's the core concept of patriarchy that women have this ability to unify to what we call galvanizer galvanizing engineering is when you define other metal and Zinc and the whole metal discovered in zinc that's the power to decide when people learn to look at societies businesses life like that and notanumandal Pawan meant to be in power that's when will restart my mother in this made and I told the story before from Mangalore and I think maybe you would have been fourth or fifth pass she came to Bombay and started working with my mother-in-law now she don't know any English writing Kannada medium what I want and then was forced to drop out of school to support a big family of brothers 17 Sushil brought up my husband and then I think when my husbands and 20 abroadabroad with her and she traveled the world she learnt English she did everything came back to Bombay and she was able to migrate toward three of her sisters from the village in to Bombay she was able to settle down her family and buy them land in Mangalore and she became a base for other girls of that community in Mangalore to come settle down in Bombay so that is the Kelvin rising a fact that women can haveby the way she paid foreign betting she is not sending her two daughters to English medium schools and I think that shift now from Hindi mein Kannada medium 4th standard dropout to sending your daughters and getting them educated that is not received in our society that black what do you think are the strengths and weaknesses of both men and women list out strengths and weaknesses of women also strength and weaknesses of meninstrument in the terror feminine qualities that also exist in men but I do believe the world actually if you look at the skill set of the future it was a feminine sleeves and so the old skill set which was the masculine skill set is analytical I will like you to remember these books that used to say if two men can do a task in this much time then how many neurolic screw Elite world and how many men will itto do for light bulbs attract commoditized woman by the customer experience for instance at a record come back and mother is the best provider of compassion and customer experience in the country Indian mother on average know how to manage her husband she knows liveMata manage my father profession and career and she cooks samosas for everybody on 26 January ko that was part of his profession she know how to bring me up in send me to an Ivy League schools should dealt with my brother she dealt with her in-laws and she ran a job of her own she had four or five different customers and her life who she was managing to perfection every single customisation of experienceclean and feminine energy which in the real world means balancing a masculine and feminine skill sets for example if you think too much Sagai which was nearly 20 years it was about a list out some masculine and feminine strengths that and weaknesses and strengths I feel that guys for some reason I might be wrong please correct me if I'm wrong but in my experience has seen the dry skin a scalable team players as you can make a Gai work with another guy who are kind AVN Sangathan and the team apparel andHindi new hit album 200 hundred guys think similarly 101 working women strength on the other hand again it multitasking it endurance being able to take like a huge amount of pain in one of the most beautiful memories of the period is what are the countries who handled well woman Prime Minister of presidents and what happening on the groundhandle the situation of humans that if there are only women leaders can be any worse and again she is a mother and during the period sitting in managing and talking to people on video and she's making it like she is part of the problem is not above everyone else because she is this untouchable so vulnerability which we talk about ittell you can also bring in A bitter truth year at the cost of being baisa mistake ok and ok now they are a big weakness that women are especially in Indian society is a lot of conditioning the divine through the Indian society from the time your little girl got old things or even even in the media reporter industry and unfortunatelyset this in the American context it was even more true in the Indian context you are told to quit your job well before and make a shoot cloud management it's still coming to me saying you know I don't want to take on a bigger project on you know I can't change jobs I'm planning to get married away from thepenis ko thus 25 accordingly practically was going to happen this is not something I wish I wish that 5050 but I think it's going to be something like a best case scenario over 60 40direct to sections of the famous movement as well and the majority in that is all just a lot of highlighting the negatives without thinking of solutions to the next generation starting the solutionsopportunity because I am one of the few Young women so as to interview people like Arundhati Bhattacharya to spend time with people like Sia Modi to talk to Mary Kom I have been given opportunity is because your gender makes you different it makes your thinking if it makes your approach different and the world is looking for different people so I will not step back and say it is only one embodiment I think he is about how you look at yourself I think people auromeera right if I think being a woman is an advantage the world will make an advantagewhen I meet other youtubers I know that they've been through a similar struggle like like like myself like it's very similar a journey is our initial Sagar we're talking about camera when you meet and wish you a successful women like yourself what that underlying Vibe like video connector sistersMNC used in manufacturing businesses and what film producer my god the bond is incredible because we connect on shared experiences and we all have shared stories we all have shared stories of going into rooms where are you only girl and other guys bathroom is working but the ladies bathroom is not working in the office I have stories Banal is that we have stories of things get pocono conference room with his I struggle with this even now let the 15 there is talking in the lekin Annakind of like everyone is talking over each other and many of my girlfriends tell me the stories on we have stories about how a lot of the socializing is done over dinners is best in financial services in the US over drinks and dinner new just don't feel comfortable talking about that and unfortunately and I'll get into trouble for saying this me to is not help our cause is given either in some ways while it's made the workplace a lot se for people are getting more scared to a womanpond on many different levels and I think probably the best part of my job is to I do is the sessions I do with young girls what would you like to know about an ambitious woman the man said it's not very different from the US and it has no reason to be different but the only thing I would say the guys is I give you a funny example that would behave differently from you so I get this thing with you guys get scared women cry in the office right leg by managersyou almost saidham hyperventilate understand chatting then ocean and emotionally mature and stuff like that I tried to tell guys like this that is it ok for you to use bad language in your face once in a while like we keep it right we say it was a moment to Banga Express on emotions through crying and is described on the floor everyday but once in a year if his bride don't chat with as ambitious is new movie Expressdifferently stone touches for it from your Outlook from a you send you hopeful about where India is going with respect to this gender equality think Professional gender equality in Hindi onlyanother really interesting think this is cold with that men having the office the 2-minute all get pregnant second come back I have had countless number of girls we have a lot of women in the thirties bracket all of them have relatives and they come back to backand also by like Matin occasionally that I drinking too much emotion and I was created for creativity confirm this emotion so as my career goals odd or even more emotional balance but emotional and the term can I use this opportunity to this request people that if there's any girl who's watching is what is looking for an opportunity I have this goal of Khada curing light at in establishing 1000 we're watching the sunny morning and entrepreneurshipyou don't get it right into US Carriers that buyceps.com I hope to be a part of that changed the Sigma sisters in my mum gift only on my life into that wanted waters and wondered what is definitely like to be a part of that change you know and while I also have been rooms with just guys I know what that side of the gameI know you guys look at women also there is some that is there is between about women that having the whole gender it's my husband and I am so doso forum with mostly guys also joined the forum which is possible sources ok and he is the only guy in this group that he is in which is all women and he says it totally changed his perspective because he said that is Reverse exam also it's not about man it's we willnice men if the majority that will FIR is the minority and it is very subconscious so you know it's not just about men if you are equal in a 50 people from one state and there was one more person from somewhere else in all speak in their language also majority syndrome it's not a man was his twin syndrome every guy should a group that you understandhe's totally surgery should at CNET change the kind many years I mean I just hope that this series of the first podcast in the series of women

Mai ko found on containment once again today stream is Engineering College we can go entire Engineering College Loni right from 6th standard very big and IIT coaching up to now when we like 25 year olds and we looking back and Engineering College in figuring ok that's what we gain from there the all the mistakes we made in Engineering College super funny conversation on engine if you currently in Engineering College thinking about getting in the engineering college absolutely everything you need to know in a super funIndian engineering student Hue enjoy the episode welcome to another episode of monk-e chat you supposed to be my co-host then we decided I am going to host the show instant loan he is also my business partner Basavaraj shade is the man was made me millions and made himself millions for very humble Gujarati one of the most intelligent guys of my life is for brother and this episode is entirely Engineering College specifically forstudent loan Aladin episode also going to feel very connected to us because we have shared your pain we are shared all the stuff you have gone through Viraj Sheth my was questioned US less jump straight into it as a 10th standard you know that you can enter Engineering College not all but I was obvious path was science because I was a guy who succumbed to pure pressure very easily so that I was from a CBSE school everyone in my school Italy everyone like 9thunderstorms band for science because as properly how the curriculum Was Your Man for science most of them and for engineering only so my first experience after 10th was keep pace main entrance exam linear because we have to get into if I feel the bass is any give money to pay for and you can even for classesthe other side of the train collide at what point will they know that no no that was then the bird flies from one train to the other cultures that then comes back to this is a moving train the moving towards each other to calculate how many times the bird that is the test and I didn'tit Karenge and I went there super competitive light environment super intense environment very depressing face like you wake up at 5 a.m. in the morning classes started 6 from 6 to 11 you have to attend IIT classes difficult problem I think that if I had better teaching that time I would have probably manage better but teaching was good for meI don't think about like meant for that kind of a curriculum itself it was not made us at all it was founder of vibes in life for YouTube on either side of India so it's like yeah I I knew Kiya Ja maths physics chemistry was not my Vibe in general I think you personal of Physics a lot but I didn't like PCM at all but for me it's like I was really good with like communication and Social Sciences and all of that clothing andnot really but but the thing is I couldn't go back to my mum and see that these are the subjects I top ten English and Social Sciences of 20 degree is artsI'd like to start withbut Guwahati Guwahati Jaenge OK then then that concept trickles down to known ID tuition those of you go for engineering tuitions in Bombay contacts is like Borivali and Vile Parle in Matunga and if you go for those tuitions their tell you that if you're not be deti are you DCT with truth of life as to why you are you doing engineering and might as wellsamvada because it becomes a discounted business to the next level become the ultimate that we don't get a newborn to the other colleges that have you any better was the third layer and if you are from which means you are coming from ACsukhdas and Vivo screen crowd and good situation if you don't do an amazing Masters after that it's over like what else will take me to you on the Third Level and now we have those that features exactly what I think it'skids Jisko class Mein Doli Le kahan hai yah to Masti karta hai na yaar Kuchh Nahin to 11:12 very and healthy environment for 17 year old kids when I look back I had a teacher in my tuition showcase OBC in place there again NID coaching tell you are right in lifescrewed to skip the living and so was pressure of people get depressed people dropout people cry because the whole life because I don't get it people try some women suicide it's like they get destroyed their trying Kiya what do I do two years of my life first getting decided by one day of an examination exact and just so much pressure to have been in that situation so I possibly give CET and not idea and even that was all you are like billion hour to complete liveis the version of your colleges something like that and this so much pressure for civil like so many students Indian one Centre everyone's like you're not trying to add the last moment rule on the formulas order that it gets so high intensity it's definitely one of my experience with others to your the worst years of my life and I know there's a bunch of students have also had like the golden use of water but I know that they would releasesChhotu Dada top 10 and that is just not as bad on the medical side of not worse yet it's just as bad for me actually my journey at restart back when I was in the sixth grade my mum put me in this class is called inside which is one of the classes that starts teaching students from the sixth Grade II was like a five-year pre-prep for it and after that this to your 2 movieMMS full movie of it so your life is there is nothing else you know there's no personality exactly and tell you that it doesn't matter only and only properties and why it has so many branches so when organ hate on the education system but I'll tell you what is good parent pushing the kids and it is the version is a parent's version of people getting error plane aeroplane lands and everybody getline for kids sitting around saying thatnext release11:12 is also internal doors teacher sunao you about engineering medicine Nahin the things to say to students To Mere Wale maths equivalent Mein Nahin de rahe the internal table thatPatang 16 year olds to like shit like that there was a dumb do like their own that features a branch to another perspective that you wish you had when you are 16 17 to get through two years and then the tell you that ne ek bar CT college starts and an idiot and I thought that onlyso I'm not going to do anything especially the first step 12th little did you know dude I feel like I had a very fancy schooling and to the money you brought up verycommunication skills and red and that's cool but back then of perspective on like the real world when I entered DJ song we meet again over a lot to but the level of education was a lot less was kind of looking down on engineering because I realise once engineering startedthat it was a lot of Rote learning in fact both learning and even CET for engineeringvah to the showcase what like system the computers using and those computers are not in use Israel about computer and it doesn't just stop at the curriculum I'll tell you at what degree the Rote learning goes engineering everyone goes for tuitions in the first which is so weird you done in tense level of tuition 11:12 again people on computer programmingclasses when you think is it I'll miss out on this one to bwn mechanics and all that is also because your parents of now we that your crippled without you should I go for the tuition and a signal level tuitions there in the professor T3 from the data mentality and was very famous Electronic design professor and electronic designs of very complex object we are supposed to teach about electron movement inside its ok to go inhan yaar mere ko movement ke bare mein aaega mere ko yah yah kaise hota hai he gives you an anagram to remember particular formula so fuddu ne apni mummy ke le gajar Le ft equal to M into p.m. them how is your maths 3 a.m.OK Google math because Mein 3 is like the what subject of all friends nearing Rai Devon if they are getting a drop of getting ok to use Mein 3 sharm kar driving and how is that guy because then all of that too early yaar loser but I was going to watch with dance team perform I didn't study atswachh chill organiser paper I got one hour of luck 22 recovered in get into it God of Kriti all of that their parents still didn't know about the top of this state is story also from my and got so I was the highest marks in CET in my class and I got into really good colleges in Bombay that purpose it crowdok and all my reasoning getting these but little did I know that that crowd Masters 12 students in each class is people from Kandivali saying that this is what cycle order and shout out to people from show beerbiceps it's a great people are still very nodi and then ODI not in terms of I want to learn circuits I want to learn programming in Orient of the nearest mere ko 11 formYad hai tere ko Sirf Do formula is like then it is a very wrong kind of node is not the fault of coming back to the wayKya Hoga I literally that that and I remember sitting in that one BW basic engineering electronics paper and not knowing anything you would solve it was the Kisne KataDam bad the next day they got it like that bad people people people really talked you like your dog is died or somethingbad for you then it really side ok no get it like it really got me and because you have so many voices around you telling you that it would actually had believing that directly open my friend very represent the height of depression record at the same time in my personal life I had like a very bad situation in fact detail beerbiceps video on this is what I had a Breakout yes no I got I got played around with the made a depression story video sogo check out my heart and that story is genuinely true I think with a loan to look back at that face and laugh ki kathaen bit but ok let's move to discussing about you know those courses that senior cell to you kill encoding in life there is an ethical hacking in one week or two days did you take the more you the one who sold that initially I was 12 later than Businessman kicked inI will one selling back to that how about how we met we will come to the ok my point is basically even with this whole thing about going for this course is just too much herd mentality in engineering owner if kids C5 get going away they get for more on the go for it and the visiting the time that ethical hacking and those are the courses that the cell you don't add anything to stop going for those is basically you know what you are doing your giving that organiser 5 star on hishe is being able to organise ago so that's what if you really able design Engineering College it comes from leadership medicinal so if you are able to organise workshop sell things don't like by the exact thing exactly you are never going to learn ethical hacking in today's we're so just completed but having people point fingers at you and you know kind of being mentally convinced that the whole career was oververy tough how did you get out of the feeling oshad now I have I have a que Te ries a from that it's honestly I got this tattoo and still today and your people look down on tattoos and already the thing with tattoos if it has a motivational message and helping you with adequate in your life that is a good thing in saying that I mean think a lot before getting a tattoo I got this super impulse only because I could have a story to tell what my life and I800 feeling of Rock bottom sunao literally the only thing you can do is upward so I asked my seniors were also failed and ask and it doesn't hurt that O broso I am also like a lot of College Fest that creeps into your life second year engineering college actually becomes one night Engineering College 2nd look back at engine is where you kind of look back and then that's where I grew up a little bit in terms of its not a good thing but getting drunk a lot party in a lot which is not good for health and retrospective in a drawing as much as I did but it out so muchpayment so much that we are going to be so bad but then it now so why does one get that type of engineering student wing and ladies and trunk outcomes from everyone is suffering like people think that after studying so hard me 11:12 you be a little but it's not bad that the case in fact even more pressure was you know that on the other side of Engineering college 1st cross the line is your career and Engineering cause the whole why was in the professortell you that there is no scope for Karaoke on engineering so you kind of create a reality for yourself that shit abhi Mani Ayyappa tender kar liya Naagin 3don't fall for the area and this other famous stereotype of Engineering professors where there is a lot of picking on students all the time anywhere so that always happen that I was that guy who's always picked against was Y1 last bencher to never gives assignments on x 3 always get the assignments done by someone else and it was just that you are you thoda Osmaniavate Karta Hai padhaai nahin karta hai assignment assignmentwrite the paragraph exactly how is written in the textbooks that delusion student the smart mirror copy the paragraphs and then and have a good guy that he'll give his assignment to his best friend that's when we make 5 copies of a Din in the end it is put on WhatsApp groups in WhatsApp groups that that's what happened during my time so WhatsApp or exceeds the thing againhammering copy baby is coughing based water so you have to copy close to 30 to 40 pages for assignment you are not learning shit dropping blindly if you don't know what it's like they actually are design and does not mean that the true ya so and you copy things the way the returned to the textbook also the sentences get over half way through the sentences like grammar mistakes that logical mistakes ki how are you and it was chapter your not explain the thing but itthe cool thing is that there is business of taking assignments from hands and writing it for your mother was the best business model for expensive it like 10 rupees for page 5 rupees a page if you doing like you know 40 pages ka assignment at 400 rupees assignment is a good wishes for him but imagine that people I meet the business owner ofassignment in Engineering College the system and this is what people don't understand outside of the engineering college world people entering and in Oracle using a good education becoming a man of women of and and then you get this your handwriting assignment liquid that is why I hate make peace with the storm that isit's that again Roli UC people going down by rules of smoking smoking up and drinking finding the peace that professor start taking you because you enter your departmental people realise that segment of professionals that govern new general category and reality then what happens is that once upon a speakerit becomes very intense coronavirus top Rohan Joshi tweeted about this one purpose of you psychologically pakane always use until they like very toxic think that a 19 year old so there was one professor who basically I can get copy the assignments were copied as a reputation wasok confronted house like most things grow117 my second year results web results came out and April literally did this he made the topper of the class that the best mongoose beta betaKyon Kata Mila aap to Hanste Dena vah class mein smile Karte The na kyon ab kya hua kya hogado with quality will come in the study will leave anything negative to prove that happens in Engineering College via this is one more instance which was like basically the professor after the Viva he picked out students based on the overall relationship with them throughout the semester if they want physically looking as if you were nisbat books so he made 30 students stay back after the waiver 2 days before the actual written exam dateto hold a including the day before exam you need to stay in college form 7 in the morning the 11 and write assignment no just just nothing you can't you can't go home and the thing about theteaching if you're not got your dream engineering job and is limited and generates a lot of them have that not everyone who knew that but it auto engineering the way it's supposed to be taught that the logic of things they taught you how electricity actually works mobiles actually workfood to teachers like the basic and take us through all the diagrams and all of that which is where the positive at microengineering cakes in the play that you are given that perspective of how machine work so basically when I'm looking at camera I can never break down exactly what is the logic of how is writing down the information that is recording through us know us how was the use of itnow in Brazilian business to be honest in office be kind of it slide your Wolf of Wall Street wife without the drugs and lack of this fast paced why after be created using the Boom a Goodbye but in order to have the speed we need to think problem solving very fast and that come directly or 21 good teacher being exposed to a lot of intelligent kids who have the same boat as fastand like multidimensional not just like books every Lies over the last year when we moved into an office and running this start up like a proper company letter corporate office leadership is learnt in Engineering college bus day you will lead your own game plan if you don't always have to leave assignments till the end of studying till the end and kind of fixing those problems in a very short span of time teaches you alot of Jugaad not fromduty of light in bus stop sad and human but you'll be l&s at this I think audio for me was where I kind of slowly star making peace with the situation and I also realised that hold on bro I actually don't know what to do in life and my overall aggregate percentage is too low for better start studying already picked up 2.35which is the lowest like this to my friend and 48 others like anything and I was like this is when I need to pick up ok so give the non engineers contact now what happened that you are 21 years old and people start kind of getting very serious about the carrier post Engineering College and is also whether it starts again like the 11 12 13 at Alleppeywhere people judging you for not going for MBA classes not going for GRE classes not going for 13 for preparing replacement if you or someone who doesn't have a game plan you look down on a lot and in retrospect the one advisor for people that is alive right now that don't follow the address don't get into things with everybody is weighted so there people were a very short they want to settle down in the United States there are very short the one on the water table corporate jobvery short I want to enter the Indian Engineering space but if you are not sure of the three things don't do those things just chill out it's ok take your time that you still no third year you figure it go for internships that's where I am actually that was the highlight of my life in Engineering College that they are in my location to utilise my time and activate Windows 10 Pro in college and Wolf of Wall Street release around that time and I suppose that whole world is able to finance I told my I told you fineinternet to something I didn't learn anything much about finance and I learnt corporate culture and realise this is not for me financial financial experts that it was notI am got the stop job at like a financial company ok finance company and they not happy because it now from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. there in office life struggle even now what is all this noise about oyo life will be sought after CET engineering after I am why work so hard to even we work for like more than 12 hours a day we are in an industry that we buy Bharya it's it's true man it's notputting in its like even if your working Bhairava live 24 hours a day for something that you like you you will not mind it because you're not you not like oh why do I do this via your is still like you want to be in the spare so that that's alright but you did your internship at intern at Reliance to share my experience with Reliance was that like I intern in the petroleum segment of contacts kissinternship Kyunki vaise normally sirf it is all ko milti hai so I went there for a certificate all that I was direction less than keyboard I didn't know what I wanted to do so he was awarded by experience had to do some data entry and I had to do some calls and all that but most of the times would realise this people there were not actually working like if you were doing and 927 job you're the only time and work you have done was the initial like 2 hours Uske bad as you take your what about childlunch break then you play a Lil bit on your phone and you chit chat with friends it's over the day is over at 6 p.m. now you're making a move the the bus has come Yog you going to your home in a lot of Corporate culture even now even people at really high positions in Corbettspoken to keep it simple but they only do the task given to them to do these three things in an hour then as 11 take I have on corporate culture is that did not got Northern Engineering College mentality of assignment Karke so I think the crucial coming back to Engineering College crucial turning point for us was third fourth fourth should got real and againcome to pressure from herd mentality my whole class was going to MBA classes and also a good idea at definitely do not leave the country because it always has a way of giving back to India since 2000 and friends around you like youSomani college football don't go to any college in the US you will make yourself don't go to any college colleges that are calling you Stevens was much it's it's difficult to get a job in USA according to like the current scenario that will come to that I will be composed Engineering College what friends are doing right now coming to Thodi of lot of people asking for GRE average GRE scores a goal with the thing ofI continue plus a Gaya totold him that there are going though so it's likely that just trying to be to be finding for you like ok it's unstable don't do it every probably don't know that maybe it's not you it's just some of the element of both had a beautiful saying he said that a lot of people always ask youGhar Nahin Hua to like it doesn't happen value to your response to that should be per Agar who are you like what I wanted to do what I wanted to just leave the country so GRE for MS was outlawed we will look down on you doing good thing was I don't really want to do a job of Engineering because the companies that come to every Engineering College at TCS Infosys Capgeminicoding based job usually and I didn't want to become a part of Corporate culture at that point I don't know but at that I need to do something different but let me just taste this whole MBA world that studies are actually interestingcat actually test your logic test English ability but not your vocabulary how well your mind can perceive reading it and how you can think it actually a very good exam and that were actually felt mentally stimulating for the first time Since 10th standard not actually use my mind so I was pretty good compared to the rest of my class because they were trained and hard core Ratna mentalityproblems really fast ok but I just felt like again I started reading a lot more what do you do want to get into IIM what do you do want to get into a very big MBA college and how is it do I don't want to do finance because I know what that would like to say that I had that you doing right nowI thought that you could do that you have to basically old call people and sayutilise my mind better ok I cancelled out the MBA options I can I stop going for the class that pretty that I like to do that I apply for jobs as well yeah I didn't have a direction what I wanted to do was also in the mentality ki I know I don't want to do engineering I am great was like management or something to do in Engineering Management degree in the US these all kinds and I have decided by some of them like in that it's not easy tochat difficult have like a stable GPS coordinates ko really good and cat plus Dhol general male Kota is likely to have a gas through like respect it's a It's not an easy grammar crack MBA is not a good MBA colleges not easy to get into the problem is that there's a lot of the MBA colleges also just like engineering agreed to it and you'll actually learn engineering in some aspects with MBA schools are eating office professionals today is kind of the same way when we talk too muchMBA is there a lot of problems again that ought to think in boxes in the world works like this you need to get up in the morning and read the newspaper everyday you need a job and I need to do the task given to MBA does create a lot of leaders but in most MBA colleges in India we actually definitely a lack of leadership people who think inbox bro institution as they worship their own company birthday card ideas themselves so even when the company is probably not doing things morally right right there like nothe best power for health food company is the best version of MBA or notdoing engineering and was actually a better chance of getting into the so again I kind of in this mentality that they realise that hold on 11:12 I give environment Idea outgoing and incoming calls are not support for three years of my life right I am not Ganesha for like 2 3 classes for yours a my last moments to chill out our main focus of this during my last moment until I became a more hard core party because I know I doelement and I didn't realise it then but I look back at it now and I realise it now I went and did a fitness certification was really important for this whole exactly and you know what I said I started cooking and I didn't know that helped me put those skills along the real life skills my YouTube channel started the fitness channel because I had I was a certified professional trainer and now the great cook and it is put out like mybeef and my fitness talk on YouTube and that give me my career today dropping out of like that's when it comes to write the college the curriculum is not going to teach you these things you need to pick up the skill sets no that can't you see this is what I want to learn outside of my college curriculum and approaches learn the skills that I did a bunch of like internships in the marketing space space this experiment and see if this is my calling and I just went with itworks good do it if you are Mumbai University University student you won't get the time to do it but bunk those college lecturers they are really not important in figure the attendance in college we will happily screw you if like me you don't match up to attendance level but I got damn you have to learn skills man don't get into the domain of who I definitely one of my friends are going I definitely one of them because I was the only that in mind that shouldn't it was in the job placement within you what jobs areI had the internship I had prospective people look down on me so much it feel like getting over it again what do you doing I think you're telling me that I don't know what you're thinking of your mentality get out of your drinking mentality and like do I think I know what I'm doing you know I am scared for you at that same person today's extremely unhappyjob letter Job Lucknow point is that what they often life again if you sure about getting a job of Engineering College MBA vs sure about Ms give you done your research you have a relative whose life is in your lifeagain this is just a perspective with two guys who was worked out for us or we believe relentlessly Naukari on the lord of failures day but he kept going because this is all we had recording turn to MBA don't want to go and see if I am doing a job or otherwise an I don't know how will start my dear kudos to a parentcollege students for some time but one kind of Battle the divisor laptop Finder for sure don't do the traditional things explain the game plan to your parents be on the right moment of force moment but you have to build towards it you'll have to show that some cash flow coming into through this business only then will they be satisfied the ok maybe this is the right path for my kid I'll wait for it here and if you can afford it ok families financially alright take your where maybe youas you don't go to find yourself in the hills do something you know if your living in India is laudable to make money at home become a digital marketer make money give this go out looking for talk to a lot of intelligent people in my first off I mean when I M A first year of life real life to great decision that made one was unemployed and I went to my mamas factory like my uncle factory and otherJawed how like the real world works non college world works assignments all that is not I think very difficult 2022 Erode because a switching from the mentality of education to Real world and money and all that I remember my mum was against this decision of not being along the conventional pass relief from a generation that you should go along conventional so do hi sunao me a lot like that I is a good job you may use these tags and number of weeping in front of him it's big but powerVPN for my mum got to ride a little Khan 2010 ok he was in his mentality of his generation in odoo happy he promised in people around them throughout the years but I'm the changed your mind so the closing notes on the engineering podcast are that develop your skills in college road building going for face glow your face committee is lighter skill it is excellent but don't think that it could add your CV you don't like don't goJugaad you learn like classmate situations how to deal with how to give respect to celebrity how to manage things and all of that is important do it if you can but do internships that's like like we couldn't stress in those of their dad in Engineering College of you all so much kamaya professionals keep them in a good boydefinitely try passing don't go through that Katie situation it might hurt the your family or more than yourself and just know that irrespective of what people tell you while you are in college your real career starts after you return 22 after you graduate with starting from zero to have good gradescause it's not like you learning anything that you actually can implement in their life we learnt about ship things are not tune relevant anymore coming to that whole topic of Engineering based jobs MBA MS let's tackle one situation and time engineering based jobs go through the job profile very well before applying it to understand what are you doing if you are interested in coding and decoding job I don't just be like ok I don't know job nahi mil raha a data analyst but you know what the data analyst profile requires you to dolike what languages are you going to learn what profile I going to take up what is your actual job located very like properly Neelkanth away from an containment actually my it got to your drops graduated at the same time as you what is my and his jobenough to do that you really want so I can go for regular engineering job he couldn't get one because of his to your dress but he's one of our stars at Mangal in today if you take your life after the whole engineering a lot of the best jobs according to me actually don't visit colleges so you are out looking don't think that only you know the people are coming replacements are the best jobs will find your dream job when you apply yourself from the outer to going naukri.comtalk to your friends try network reference is there really work because those guys know they've been in the circle for a battery know whether right jobs at the digital scene in India the startups in India popping directorate jobs out their kind of War looking ok don't just engineering based on thinking that yaar Agar man in pilva places a Nahin Baitha I won't get a job that the case work jobs case with NBS is that ask yourself from now you want to a marketing MBA itfinance understand your specialisation is more even toward them marketing finance on whatever specialisation understand that maybe two years after I've done this course and specialisation I will do these things if you doing a communication MBA know that you want to be a brand manager at company so that you can improve the branding of that specific company are my understanding and learning from seeing my friend you done MBA is right of a college student right after college you should we should taste the worldalso if your Kiran ke finance MBA finance internship letter on something I did it is built for some people it not been for some people read in terms of marketing newage marketing is digital and you can learn much more by working in a digital marketing startup grind you learn from him in fact it is actually harm you if you study marketing in MBA college because they have their own ways of thinking they probably don't know what is actually happening on ground will give you case studies but they'll give you case studies of the biggest companies and that's not like and appreciate it also the courses are kind of outdatedin the last three years because of digital in your dream is not really top 10 MBA colleges debate should be taught by hard-core marketers ok now like a job if we are there in the middle of the mark of the world and the loan on the job and its symptoms of those things where it comes to some people and delivery outgoing person you can think of that is very very bright like you need to know Kiya thisis very like you need to be on the job you guys are on your phone's all the time marketing today is happening to social media platforms is not difficult to grab it you just need to keep your eyes and ears open if you think you can do social media Wale Jameen probably a great marketing MBA think about a lot before jumping onto that you do a job understand if you can afford It consider doing and a finance MBA abroad you will gain more skills that if you want to settle abroad and you don'tengineering graphics Driver for MBA abroad but in order to the unit of work for 5 years you might even get Stanford however the best and apply your skills much better when you have liked to three years job experience and then you go for MBBS and the final option the people go for is MS again it is for you if you are genuinely interested in the world of Engineering you are not real engineering in India letter from NIIT and from there not taught it to the level with which were taught in the eliteso my point is that yaar if you are genuinely interested if you are a range of from 3 days that we should do when some papers have you made some really cool projects do you know that is your calling only then go for and don't go ki Hamen data science me Kuch Kar Lo all of you went to the herd mentality is kar lunga main Kuchh Kuchh kar lunga don't go that mentality because you will not have you0% education genuinely for that reason go to a good college don't go to a whatever college and then after he was a gaya kuch kuch kar lunga but and also know this about going to us in this something people don't awkward often Viraj me of travel throughout the world remember that the way of Brown person is perceived in the subcontinent is always a Raja Pyar always be larger than the second and if you travel anywhere in the world there isshuttle shuttle it's not about the physical layer of racism in your own home you will be celebrated don't be a second class citizen abroad when you receive the Indian startup scenes popping the Indian economy is popping it is because you can't enter the investment that I'm going to China which makes India the biggest market biggest population by 2025it right youngest population that the most money to be made if there is a market that you see today go for it attack buildings around it with something sustainable if you don't work at the start of the right skills and do things but don't if you don't have a game plan in mind what about what you going to do in the US or abroad just don't like Miley and if you're not sure about anything Trance Shiva kar saktalike that is your photo option has not spoken about in of startups in India the correct ones are hungry for the right to write my OSS and if it's ok it's beautiful work life balance is a very rewarding job if you join the right start up the co-founders will take care of you go out hunting do internships at start of this site is with someone told me this when I was in Engineering College No 2 3 things to carry out the truth and going to TCS Infosys and all issorry not going to teach you especially when you doing like three years of your entry level job at the same job all the time and there will be a cap on your carry-on that case in start of this no capo new Kariyo ok because of this so many things you learn the job right today you doing at ask a tomorrow you doing task be you have to fill up for someone sometime like the hundred employee at Facebook today is worth more than a billion dollars in Indian mm 35 Facebook seat cover of India be one of those500 people don't don't aim to be one cognitive abilities and cog in the wheel of Infosys unless that were calling in life and you know then is another separate story but my advice to you guys is really be open working as art of you will find your

38,Scary Dark Indian History ft. Radhakrishnan Pillai | The Ranveer Show

only in today's episode with talking about Indian history but on the Boring indian street food in your textbooks interesting value-adding Indian history that can actually make a very interesting person we go to social situations that you bring up these topics with teacher Dr Radhakrishnan Pillai in today's episode is a big matter to me is also the smartest human being in my life even the most well read Indian ever come across trust me in this episode is only an adult rated informationXbox but in a fun monk-e chat episode 2 podcast lesco stories from Indian history in a much more fun way we got the person for you doctor allocation for your mentor to me but more than that you are a very interesting and I would like to call you brother figure in my life and when we need to talk about some very creepy stories of Indian history that were not taught in textbooks so whenever kids are age especially learn about historyrecent history mediaeval times of the Independence movement but India's Got like more than a 10000 your old history and actual or receiver not taught in schools including things are very dark things that are related to the aukat things that are seen larger than life so so that's what this podcast about Adam so happy that your touching up on some finer points he was known as you wrote and every time we meet it generally starts with the YouTube channel and everything that you dous to lead us into the next otherworldly topics most important The Spiritual aspects which we always this code ensuring that no one thing I strongly believe that history is written by winners of Warsomeone is one of war they will always write the history textbook according to what famous them shop or to make the losing side feel bad when your right now one of the thing is that there was a race idiomsInnova in the Indus Valley Civilization and in the race that came in from Central Europe and Central Asia mainly on white skin is called Aryans and that's why Punjabis are fair and the rest of India on order with the evidence that is not true at white you like to add in this topic and what is thisAryan it has been used in the world history not only in India in Germany also the user's word Aryan and they say what is anion it's a noble race that's how the whole thing starts but if you look at Sanskrit are very fortunate actually study Sanskrit the word Aryan comes from word Arya which means and noble person you say the Aryan it's not just the race is a quality of a person should look at the Mahabharata the book which is much more beyond in 2000 of US Navythen use the word Aryan comes very common over there so when somebody Sadri Singh think that sir madam Jhandu Meena generation using ko are you this early bird festival essay word is very common in Indian culture coming back if you look at the woods string that were movements of power politics OK where are you know what we call in India cast is I'm across the world you find the word racism the race theory across the globe so you want to see for the briton world of the Western world race became a very importanttrace the Aryan theory film Hitler the German culture so prominently this hole theory of Aryan invasion is something that somebody best came from there and I just told in the throat in our history books Ki Hai SS hoot hoot hoot but there is only one sided to it in the Western world talks about the historical fact that we came to civilized you came a backward kind of a man may be madehuman beings with more than the backup that Western happen is Aryan theory is that if you actually see genetic profiles of North Indians and compare them to people in Central Asia Uzbekistan Central Europe like Ukraine there are some matches DNA matches now what I read from my historical studies did not a biography of a yogi books like that actually Indian spiritual books they say that Indian culture was so advance compared to the rest of the world15 20 thousand years back he left Indian win 10 17 to Ukraine and settled in Ukraine went and took a pill Chhotu Central your that's how you see the match of DS true and this is something that all line in spiritual book strongly believe in so so so what is your take on this Aryan theory finally was the actually a tribe that came to India conquered the dividend drove them out of the Indus valley civilization that actually happened so I think you spoke about very likely that if you look at Indian geographybig division in the centre the Vindhyachal mountain Tumhara trenbolone the Maharashtra above very easy to conquer Maharashtra and below because of the mountainous regions in in South was comparatively protected is not that we did not have inventions in the south to look at the north in a once they cross the Punjab and the lord of days for people who directly Cayman but after Maharashtra Mahila of resistance thanks to the Maratha culture on the Sandeep South the cap the cultureIntex the temples the monument was to be protected so the one theory that goes as rightly pointed out the providence and the Aryans were divided in two and half the people above are Aryans very white in colour and they have a different way of body stock Corporation features features and deep within south all about in a big dark skin featuresSomesh of those who think they don't look at the past week and there's always wins and matches have seen people in Northern very dark and it doesn't mean that in the North North Indians what is interesting to look at the differences but maturity says that as she looked at the difference as you start seeing commonalities to the next topic which is what is a beautiful conversation about was notmediaeval times by Chanakya himself there was some dark magic and occult used in the war yes so so you actually readable AutoCAD 2008 aukat is basically like adding the Hindi word for it would be something like kala jadu correct which isrocket and want to call black magic and things like the other worldly practices is used across the globe do you think I do1 Africa and Harry Potter's on many of these modern thank you have the concept of witches and understand this that what is offered from an Indian perspective the right there is a darker site which is not generally spoken about kala jadu all those and What happenslook at things that are known and things that are unknown and typically what happens is that when you are not able to find success in the known method you try to look at and nonmetals and that's where you know slowly from faith in god you study when worship in The Devil's to there are you know people who pray to bhoot Pret than enough great things in which promotes Kala Yadav I am very careful about this whole thing because once you getAadat mental trap so let me also give the other side before I tell you about Chanakya the walls and as there is black magic tricks also white magic magic what is black magic the darkest night magic is actually healing due to the right methods to invite The Other worldly people the Bible invite the domains and the devils are the all the people involved the devtas are also using it at the biggest superficial level you know if youtwo people fighting or two kingdoms fighting is generally known as a military war we have people who are having the amine with soldiers elephant better weapons things become bigger it becomes shuttler ok is got there I am not recommend thatis that it is packed is even today to some extent but what was the practice like exactly calledand it should be sacrificed the animal animal sacrifice and you get all the things mentioned in detail and looked into it but negatively I said ok this way the practices not practiced by Chanakya but given the people before its if you look at that there are many Gurus some Gurus actually promoted in a big way like to have Brihaspati and Shukracharya so what is the date of the Gods are there is a lot of the Demons they will use all thistension Sanjay Nokia latest Rai does not try this interesting it goes into even finding out certain parts of may be an animal is the use of witchcraft in bald and things like that in those days everything is fair in love and war s***** many techniques including the market but so what was the result of the Orchid on the Anime like they used to fall they used to get demoralizedsocket one is at the physical level II instrumental level III is the intellectual and spiritual level at the physical level you know a person actually what we called in today's generation probably what is Bio chemicalsmental balance society goes crazy to confuse them so you know what is that you send the wrong message and people start believing it so what's interesting is that finally in the game of War you try various techniques and and the world history model in India it's all about getting to the winning side come what may show in the western philosophy Greek philosopher philosopher specifically how the Tarzan horse that ok so you send a wholegift and finally the people come of it and kill enemy in houses the call Vinay so what is always trying to use the negative practices to win over the enemy and this is also very very physically mentally and intellectually strong understand this because we use this this can actually born U tubemis u z you can be the one get affected let me tell you that I know of a person and really know of a particular person who used to do all this was a very shopping for me and never ever promote what happened because my father actually got infected with that increasing the person who knew it the signs and studied it a lot of witchcraft and all those missing my stop that was a realise when I stand to use it to somebody it actually came to my family so be very carefulbondon what you want to destroy somebody else can actually destroy you be very careful writing actually this is a very deep topic and will be touched upon these and other whole podcast site on let's move on to the next great Indian conspiracy social as you know I am a huge fan and a huge follower of viruses which is the Yogananda satsanga society which is run by which originally founded by Mr Yogananda Paramahansa Re aahu also my Yoga guruYogi miyala audit influence Virat Kohli a lot influence Steve Jobs alot and really like that book has all the answers you could ever have English not read the book make sure you do because it's a life-changing book its a book that has influenced millions of people directly to the leaders absolutely and so that some must read if not read it sorry but it also very heavy but it's not everyone's cup of teaspend time of the sea to the dictionary on the side and it's very difficult and one of the key of story is mentioned in that betweenAnant compared to something which is teaching from yoga let's not get into the details of the philosophies but let's talk about one of the stories which was that if you actually study the history of Jesus Christ so I think he was born around Israel like he was born Jerusalem and that was generally there is Palestine a track record of until the point where is a teenager and indirectly the jump to the point where he is 30 years and above and as one whole period in the middle when no one knows where he wentwhat he did in the snow track record of that according to ancient Indian books according to yogic Sciences that talk about Jesus Christ and they say that he actually spent a lot of time in India learning something called kriya yoga which is also the main kind of teaching of the wires as the main teaching of the autobiography of a yogi should give the view was some kind of introduction to kriya yoga as a whole Potter stopping by the but it's basically a very advanced form of you can now a normal BPAasan when you're building a body in different ways but you a lot to do with your mind you can be determined in different ways you can you know work with the soul in different ways and clear Hoga involve your mind and your soul a lot as much as it does your body the result of this is that you get a lot of spiritual progress like by doing your kriya yoga you advance alot spiritual years which leads to actually a biological level brain development it adds a lot of capacity to your brain128 percent of total capacity and activity like unlocks the remaining 92% remaining 90% of it and that's what they say Jesus Christ did for 12 years he went to Himalayas he got trained by the local Kriya Yog and then took that knowledge about west and if you actually go and see the Origins of any kind of religion in the world it always somehow begins with something related to yoga and not saying related to Hinduism India is related to yogamanipulating the human body manipulating the human mind to achieve your maximum potential and now kriya yoga was lost both in India and by the way that over time with people stop practice but it arising again people are getting more aware about it in the X 11 so so my question to use have you heard the story of Jesus and what do you have to say about this whole thing so cal conspiracy theory yes of course I heard about this and in a lot of people have written about there are fictional hourshistorical references also awarded another rightly pointed out if you read autobiography of Yogi you do get references of it now I am not a scholar on the subject but I wouldn't be against this particular theory saying that in a Jesus never came to India logically for me it looks that anybody who has served the world directly or indirectly as a spiritual person I am vichar PagalWorld yaden and India has been the the centre of spirituality for the whole worldfor human history together physically ke mono could be debatable but the fact that I am sure which our great Master live he or she has got influenced by India and let me come very specific the Himalayas what happened this great country is that it is almost like a spiritual centre at this particular Hollywood charger mobile would use the mobile with some particular point in where we have to go charge it has always been The Spiritual charging portthose directly or indirectly I know that this theory could be true because he must ok come here and I read somewhere I don't remember whether they were the references that I actually went to predict the place in Kashmir and there is a particular place where name is equal to Jesus and there are some books written on it coming back what is the essence of a distance that it came on Om is one part of it is Jesus respected as a great Saint yes and I looked at his theories a very muchjust what we believed in the theory of non violence in the barrels are main use a great Saint who believed in Om what were built by will be done that exactly what we believe in India in our country using the did you do your best and leave the rest so what happens to the new Mein do everything with the end of it finally it's about giving up to something higher than the thing I definitely will win is that in the impact that Jesus created is among the few people in this world would have done Swami VivekanandaJesus and the impact that he had Global is I think of whether you follow a religion or they are some of the greatest masters of the world to study the life when you come and say yes this is basically some of the common yogic practices to one instance to drive commonality the Bible with the followers of Jesus for document in the Bible say about everything began with the sound of Om write Om in the creation of the whole world is there are parallel then again Om comesBhilwada theories that we have in Yoga Pranayama this conception no doubt about that it could be a real fact that Jesus must have come to India after delivery accepted or no the reference or no but why not know and what are you saying it's actually a great spiritual practice call the kriya yoga the last point is that what is kriya yoga I think you mentioned the word please practice it but it needs to be trained like you need to be traineryoga I don't have a Guru hitting your back this is not a physical level it's highly intellectual mental in we can go bonkers so practice which perform even if you want to learn cricket you require coach right to practice kriya yoga make sure that you are having the right Guru will teach in that particular part because sometimes you get and miss guided we want to achieve the highest form of yoga kriya yoga rating make sure you have a group are you I am a practice meditation for my practiceis basically the vedantic method which we call the panchakosha and again its parallel to kriya yoga you may choose various parts or my passes with it but that doesn't mean I'm different from kriya yoga at the end of its all about the mind and merging with the universe 2019that is one direction on a personal level but you really need to connect Wi-Fi with that whole community if you find sense in what does a few understand the signs that a talk about a newly hired the talking sense that when you were when you 100% sure that this is where I want me and want it and you know this that instead of

powerful content creators get together in 2035 maybe they will be enough money power Fame cloud and good intent to collectively form a new political Movement in India on various theories that is that is true that is 100% true because I was reflecting on something similar yesterday where I watch Top 5 minute add of a bag by carryminati watched it for 5 minutes okpower right now as a few months ago there was news at carryminati is going to go in Bigg Boss Bigg Boss season when it gets his power he has power over traditional celebrities and he is 21 years old so he has to decide whether That Power goes and that is going to happen as mobile phones and the access to internet becomes available to more and more people we are going to see more and more carryminati's that they talk about PewDiePie being at 50 million on a sleeveIndian entire population is YouTube sari you will see at least 20 30 50 million youtubers come of this country definitely definitely the handover of power that going to happen in the country over the next 10 years Excelso as a podcast that certain conversation to live for I made this couple I think around a year ago when I discovered them of Instagram I am glad to have a podcast AVN new thank you you are EP 877 episode remember the first time you message I was so excited you are going to Ladakh I think I am very good with dates really good day it was a 31st of 30th Julyand we were going to Laga of last year of 2019 and we were going to Ladakh and you message and she told me that some verified account message called your biceps I knew I had seen your videos since a really long time and I was really excited because that was the time when a lot of popular people started sharing our videos in the stories first for you to get really excited when somebody I know shared my video and then we spoke and uneven Ladakh and then we decided to meet some time in mailAugust 16th August 16 the 17th August can we met write on essay on social media along the way your a video creator even outside of light source media you did all video creation prayog the same thing was funny when writing when you when you see a content please by Sodium content creators you know exactly the calibre and the Pedigree of that content creators my first hand was insane writing unit insane like video unit and then I found this one cupis minute and the next thing I know you all started growing exponentially and there were no windows all time fastest growing on Instagram accounts for the first question is simple I think the audience is pretty much more about your life that were together in college on College Fest gathering methyl got to know it I want to ask you all about your whole hand about doing Instagram because I know you are less people even offline and you are genuinely people very vo can vary driven about the kind of contenteating in contrast to people who feel a lot of people want the glamour when the famous therefore create contact your Lakshmi won't put on the content in the glam The Fame the numbers of money on outcome for all and access the sustainable model for content creators so my question is how did you all view this whole journey when you are looking back in election this Guru so fast this all this happened how you are looking at its completely unbelievable because the so why should I startMetro start from right now and then what on April in April when the lockdown in May March when the locker has announced you went on to your channel and said that now content creators are going to grow a lot ok it's going to be good for content creators because people are going to be at home TV is not working then people will be using avideos on YouTube and stuff like that and at that time in the month of March I was so what we were doing our first brand collaboration and I was very worried ok I get really anxious when something good is going to happen like that of an anxiety when that you use to get when you are going for a school picnic and you couldn't sleep one day prior to that sort of anxiety and I was over it 1 lakh views and get YouTube mein comment Kiyabranco ke clock using and I also spoke to Manisha also spoke to her aaj ki 8 and usually what is a Nahin aaenge to about 100000 like 6 months ago I getting 1 lakh views and that many views right now we get like 10-15 minutes after putting out the video is unbelievable even for us and we feel really grateful that it is happening is like a dream come true and making contentplanting out videos this way incidentally it just happened because I've always been the one who is win a bookish person ok so if you ask me questions related to film or if you ask me anything related to media or content that other people put out online then I can't draw a blank because I am not the person who will watch a video that has always been in the creative line for his entireso it was assumed that he would do something creative then I would figure out my journey but then in 2017 something happened happened 2016 2016 2016 in the month of December I am a school friend of mine who had just shifted to the US and he had just got his job in a really big company arrived andreally really good friend ok so we were just having this conversation that how much do you on then he goes on to say like $130,000 $30,000 for your so that says package so I am like whatever I am doing right now even if I do it for my entire life at the end of my life will I be able to earn that much if the answer is no then I am not living up to 100% potential and I have to prove it somewhere else sothis is where it stand for and I kept looking for something else to do something more to do with my talent because I have this theory that in India a lot of people are underemployed they are not utilised up to their fullest potential and that's one of the problems in our country so I kept looking for staff and in January 2017 I came across this Facebook channel called NAS daily I had around 1 lakh Facebook likes at that time not verified account and he made of videoabout Tokyo that I will explain Tokyo to you in Japan to you in 5 minutes was really interesting and watch that video nava yes if I get to do something like this in my life then life is something meaningful and it just happened to be that around August 2017 he put up a video saying I want to expand and I want more creators to come with me when I travel and he just said that make a video like me inand put and put it in the comments below so I made one video and I said ki he is making a daily video so why not show him that I can do it consistently consistently as well so I made for videos just like him and he noticed me at that time and I was really excited that maybe I could be one of those guys who can travel with him at once again he noticed that same year as documented you notice a content creators energy and it's it's something that onlyonly a writer will know about a content PC sense who the person is behind the content on any bad hello back the videos were really had that energy in the X Factor that is always an x factor Kuchh Na Kuchh To hota hai jo Logon Ko samajh understand that as a creative your never satisfied with the video that you made one week so it happened that heGordon touch he added me on Facebook and everything but for some reason it didn't work out and then he came to India and I travelled with him in India and while I was doing so I thought that he has a different style I mean the way of approaching a video is completely different although his out I like his outcome alot but his way of approaching video is different so I thought ok he is not going to hire me because I am from India and there are a lot of visa issues he is fromand yes we really easily and not gonna get visa really is it is always going to be an additional hassle for a fee is not gonna hear me so I not start something of my own why not I mean I know that this is something I would like to do that why not start something so this is where it started from in 2017 December and the idea was completely different from what I am doing right now the idea was following love I would go to a place and ask random people one questionwhat is your definition of love so that's why I say I am following love that I am following that question everyone that question failed on day one because everybody work everybody was giving me very generic answer that formula was travel formula with living in a mountain with these answers don't make good videos that failed on demand but the line and the name statusI coming because we got married honeymoon he is always the price at Mami is well so he is always been a very good story telling he has a way with putting wordin a very good way and I think a lot of people when the watch the videos they find his line Mujhe Fark padta hai or Ham Kya kar sakte hain it says it's the way he said to the way he puts it so those things have always made him very special so that's so his videos were like that they were not vlogs point your camera and Singh Achcha Mere Piche Dekho yah waterfall and you know I'm going into this Temple not just that it should somethingtalk to people have conversations and then find a way to concluded at the editable on voice was so when we were when you're planning a wedding and planning as 2018 we got married as 2018 Mein and started putting videos in December 17 he started Chikmagalur one-12 Udaipur and stuff like that so then I knew where to go somewhere for honeymoon in he had never been to Europe size at chalo will go to Europethat's how I started an acid ok he makes is very nice videos so I will Pitti xvvideos2 tourism Brad also I also want to add that you are seeing yourself plus one of the most people I know for this is like a match made in heaven she is google something about politics and social issues I will come across somethingnot that is not that was about stuff but I mean my dad is much more than I am I don't think I am very tired at all the sign of a lifelong learning something new everyday I am never done so that when did I started taking his videos in a Startup itching in tourism boards ki aise kar sakta hai we can do something like that we can do something trying for that so manyinterested in getting people along trainer showcased after them and Indians at felt the videos the same made around your pretty much standardization of blogs or they give you a few things the Nokia Sajana Hai you take this flight to do that you do that you do that but he was not accurate first of all it was not very much in detail about se accurate than it was not in detailI knew he could do a better job so I started picking and innsbruck tourism board replied positively and then we met someone who handles a lot of tourism for Austria from India is name is issue in the mud and at that point of time we were how many 5000-10000 live Bihar 5000 likes on Facebook absolutely no presence on Instagram and had not put up a single story in my life so that is where it came from but he saw that there is some potential in thisvideo from Udaipur he is a interesting a sponsor a sponsored half of our honeymoon when we had no but they were ready to sponsor so we were like ok there is expected that people are noticing and from that I was in touch with us I am really lucky as a look back and definitely say this way that I am really lucky to come in contact with some reallypeople who are ready to help me out so he was constantly monitoring my content and on and off used to chat about contact Sohit use to ask me one question all the time are you doing this full time and I used to be like no I am doing it with my other commitments and earning money on the size and supply that and finally in 2019 we decided to take the leap we decided that lets take a chance for your let's give ourselves a yourwhat we want and at the end of the year we will at the most the worst possible scenario would be we have 100 good videos with us but Nobody's watching them that the worst case scenario and you are ready for that we had a little bit of Savings and stuff like that so we were like let's do that because you wanted to do an MBA or post graduation but we couldn't find something that satisfies our needs to be designed our course our thinkingthe Canada or maybe Australia or something like that into a degree and then what we do was sweet work in a job for 2-3 hours on at those rates and then spend when you're traveling across the world because the Traveling across places like South America or in Southeast Asia aur places in Africa it's not that expensive if you earned in one of the leading currencies if you earned in UST or Euro then I found then its different thingsonline rupees because of the conversion rate you always get screwed up so that the plank post graduation Karenge Kuchh To when will work for 2-3 hours will save a lot and then you travel all over the world will just and then will I have to interrupt you guys to bring you back to the present like thing thing I remember 2019 is where I discovered u i discovered your Ganpati videoso I'll video but now how does it feel and I know it sounds like a very powerful statement but it is the two social media is a cultural game changer in the modern day and you have probably opinion leaders on social media in that upper layer of power on how does it feel being your opinions and people look to you in terms of use only from these people what is that we live today after thiswe are really inspired by Leonardo DiCaprio when he won the Oscar he used that opportunity to talk about climate change there was a lot of controversy behind it it has been snapped so many times but he use that platform to be more than himself that platform to spread a good message and that is where our entire philosophy of whatever the topics that we choose all the videos that we make comes from that if you have aform no matter how many people are listening to 10 people hundred people 10,000 people 1 lakh people use that platform for something good to use social media for social good you know you mentioned how people came into your life and help to including you like I just feel that way no intention is that clean automatically right people like comment your life to help you achieve like the way you are constantly looking for help your constantly looking for help with light inside your mind your drowning and whateverall branch is coming towards your way you are trying to hold onto it and trying to figure out how this can take me phone what's the what's the plan going forward like I know that news a master mind planner finance business OutlookI told him was ki you just focus on the scripts of the shooting of the editing you just focus on that I will get you there I will put you up another I will figure out the food I will figure out you don't spend any portion of your mind space looking into that so I was working side by side and found it so about what we want to do in the future we have a lot of different ideas for content we have a lot of different plans we want to410 series wanna drive conversations on a lot of important things but I think we were left in a little bit of flexibility in which direction we want to go near flight we don't have a map we have a compass that thing that we know which direction you want to go into how we will go there we don't know because as social media is always changing to be no where we want to be we know where we want to be we know what sort of impact we want to create a light and we want to increase the value ofyou that we get so a few days ago Modi ji announce that Indians to manufacture more toys in India so the last video that we made about 8,000 Bharat was speaking about Mor toys more furniture and what footwear and how in these things we can be self reliant so I am not saying that Modi ji watchtower video but some valuable person some IAS officer somebody who has that sort of reach that approach might have watch that video maiwhat that Idea and not because Abhiyan you have said it but it's a good idea that reached somebody who can actually make a difference and that's what we want to do I request you to name some people who reached out to you in terms of a we don't like to be political at all would not showing any famous person who is like reached out to us department list out to US after the national education policy video but we were really careful about it because theI don't want to be political at all so we said that thank you so much but we will go through the procedure that our PR person will talk to her he said that and then he got upset and he was a king images of thank you for this whole thing about the nature of social mediamost used social media is that they will place was awfully writing but hopefully left wing person depending on what you say so as news content creator how do article that that said I don't want to be a news content creator because a news content creators very limiting other concepts that I want to discuss the don't fit into the typical archetype of a news content creator I don't want to be someone who reacts on you baby baby as sure as an Abhiyan new fan I can call this new age newsee what happens is realise in the month of August that we are only focusing on recent issues and we wanted to prove it at the cost of views as well as fine but at least a few videos we want to make timeless videos that can be watched 1 year down the line as well and still that will give value to people so you want to create both you want to have balance of both so yes news will be there but it's very tough because what I see on social media is like thissocial media has a sort of a bloodlust kind of like all other people's desperation with their lives within the desperation spills as blood loss on social media ki where is your opinion on the scene where is your opinion on this thing you are not spoken what does issue Kidhar Kidhar Kidhar you don't care about any of the things happening in India you know you don't care about violence against women UN Mela video on rape and all that I like bhai we made to videos digit stop rape no be a little practical the thing about social mediaalways doing for blood always want a response the way they are anticipated and is an echo chamber is an echo chamber because if I don't require your views then I have a thousand years only if I don't agree with what you are saying and I don't project was views on social media then then suddenly you are everybody use a supporter turning you know into your biggest Enemies onsending you hate messages and stuff like that so I talk to all kinds of quantitative everything from beauty to fitness to you guys to like you know just what we went out of business of all the general George Henry is the one which is the most scrutinised while the positive aspect of it is more views people are very interested in knowing what you'll have to hit the downside is that there is a massive wave of hate u always Proany without you all will have you know people who is head on it on a very light personal human-level how do you get the pleasure Kapil so I don't know that also plays a role in protecting yourself of course it does there are some things that we take care of at the input level like when we are choosing the topics when we are making the videos that we will not make videos about politics but we will make videos about policies so if there is a good policy coming up like thepolicy whether good or bad what are the positives What are the drawbacks it's our job to discuss it that is what we do at the input level while choosing the topic while making the video we make sure that if we criticize anybody than its constructive criticism is not whataboutism we try a lot of times to back it up with numbers because numbers are easier to believe in you its always make sure that your opinionare not given more importance than what is a fact what is a known Fact and try that at the execution level after the video is done we just leave it aside v11 decide it it has a mean it's been a learning curve for us because in earlier days we were so hungry for that attention that we use to get excited whether it's even if it's a negative comment and we used to engage with them just to increase our engagement but now we used to do that but nowdon't look at our America be know that this is going to be a controversial video VS Liva phone the side and we sleep so we don't we don't really like as a person because he has been a creative feared for his entire life his parents have been in the creative fields here when exposed to that world since I was a child so in that sense is developed some sort of maturity to deal with such things I am from a completely non creative backround so both my parents have no Expothis nobody my family dost two way just strictly nodes so then for us getting this sort of backlash was really really personal it I know you still really shake me up in the beginning and at times sound with some things that people have set up being so route that I have actually stopped cried and wondered whether there is any sense and doing was reduced to stop them and said listen what is the purpose of what we're doing why are we doing whatever we doing and then you know it'sis it made me want to give up everything I've learnt to let things that the tipping point at the Clash of the Tik Tok video we got an unusual or after the our corporate you and a lot of times people would always say stuff like you know kya kar rahe ho tum content Tumhare contact se Kuchh matsome people made of video about us being social media influencer Nazriya causing spreading forward was used and someone actually share that video on personal chat to me and then I'd really drove me nuts and hydrocotyle personally because I know that both of us come from a really good place so that reallymy head you know I actually sat down and we were actually making a video against the environment impact assessment draught and against coal mining and then I was like what are we doing what are we doing well then that one of the largest like ok a bus Ho Gaya aap to point it helps that I have him but is winner learning process but like even today was only all about social media I all like a beautiful missionswhich I strongly feel wala from the outside looking in both both individually all the other Blackberry locked in the how are you looking at that game how to turn your future on the skin I want that to be more positive content there has to be more positive content to tackle with all the negative stuff that is out there that we have to talk about something that changed his staff whatever is there are only two ways of dealing with but there is a line with in Rang Deif you don't like something then you change it you are not satisfied with what are you going to do about it don't executed at least that is that is the question that we want people to think about which is whatnew about lighting again 2 days back where it's like that so many cry babies on social media it all our friends were not content creators and all who are the people of use your thing I have to meet people want to show the care even if they may not actually care and it's become cool to just put the opening of the blame so and so will everyone else but not take action about yourselfwhen people call me walk I am like I don't want to be war because book are those people who are putting one status about it and forgetting in 10 minutes later I am like no I am not ok I am not book I have a hard question for you guys have tied with a lot I know that the age of 40 I'm doing a lot of business is a very natural even more natural and content creation dost always question that after 40 I know that a content creation Carriers as well as a business grow to a degree weather will be aentering politics available toyed with the idea of becoming policymakers entering the world of politics we could definitely Advisors I don't want to be I don't want to enter into politics no plans as such because it's very limiting it is very limited and we have seen some really promising people can you expect that thought I don't want to take names but in 2012 there is a really big wave in India and you are expecting really greatchange from a certain person but when that person has that power of doing something a lot of drawbacks are also coming into the picture to Indian politics is a little screwed up we were talking to somebody who is in Delhi who is father and law on tested for an election and he was telling his own Experience so he approached one certain political party and that one certain political party ask for 60 lakh rupees just to make him a candidate so that they can promote your messageok he went to another a certain party which is popular they also ask for 40 lakh rupees so he did not want to he didn't want it on to another that sort of money he just wanted to contest from his own village in Haryana and then just do something to change so he contacted as an independent independent candidate and as you can guess he lost because even though he is a loop till Gai nobody is going to support him so you have to be a sourcewith the party and in a party that is hierarchy so we don't really plan to go into politics but what a lot of a lot of things if people don't know if you have three aspects of our administration overall you have three arms so you have the Judiciary which is the entire legal system the court system you have the legislative who are the MLA is the MPS MLA state level MPS are the ones go into parliamentfighting and walking cotton throwing stuff make a rocket and you have the executive sales executive are you know the PM of body the cabinet that are there the executive they are supposed to make sure that laws Mera actually implemented as if it all we would probably be an advisory role to the executive or we would love to probably be on committee is the draught you know reports to change you guess the 90s kids just like menew ice the Optimizer in my heart over it is but a strong with that when people are age are 50 years old 60 years old I hope that will be living in a new India where are you know that all the things that pin generation wants but I don't know dual think that that a possibility of using actual people died in small towns also going to turn into the evil that is you knowthat is 50% population is under the age of 25 so that's crazy for India that means to 50% of our people have not decided what is going to be the future of this country that's the biggest strength of India that half of a population is young population who have they have not made up their Minds they are not that opinionated try to convince something radically new to an old person is a Casa nature but a new personhot September to change so yes there I would love to be optimistic about it but let's be practically optimistic about that but keeping in mind a practical optimism what can possibly go wrong for that 18 year old who is 18 today who will be 50 whenever you know 32 years later but what can go wrong not taking an active part in whatever is happening aroundmeaning of passive observer of whatever is happening around the thing that happens around us like you can say 93 and 94 practically feels like an entire generation apart so people my age have already gone into jobs they work for like for 5 years that settled in the accepted that whole life is a lot of them have kids now so that their into that cycle where ok bye have to raise a kid and you know if its huge responsibility and is also one thing that sort of footnew view because you are being who is dependent on user then your focus become goes on that child so I feel like our generation in the 90s had this template put in front of us to study up to XX yours you do in a Master's or whatever it is you get married by exercising your kids can you go on which still continuing the same template that our fathers and mothers have lived through if thatcan use then I don't know to be you know pragmatic if people continue the same template to thoda Mushkil lagta hai because what is happening is people are living life without giving themselves a chance and without thinking it's Roop without asking answers questions ki do we have enough money for whatever your doing do we need whatever we are buying RV financially physically and mentally ready for children whatplan to do once we have children you know what do we want out of our lives if you don't ask yourself these questions if you don't give yourself a chance then you are living the same temperature life you will go by the time you like 40 years old 50 years old and feel like I had a good life but I had of your dreams and they were not fulfilled and then you try to pass them on to your child and that cycle continuous so you know as a podcast whoever you are podcasting with you kind of becomeaction of fat person so I have so many things to add your first leave this concept of biohacking I just bought that medicine and medical technologies in advance so much that anyone who born in the 90s prodigal live 210 $120 life expectancies Goa which creates possibilities of new Carriers and also create possibilities of Bodom offline cold areas of example of foreign trade of a loving the job how long will love this job for 15-20 years will probably want a shift after the ex 1.1address I speak to almost all the content creators in India had few interactions over 90% of the human beings with good intent and I also feel that called God called the universe caller tune no that energy that helped you get the correct people in your life anyone who grows to a certain degree in contact always has done the level of good Karma that niceness that good intended for you go to that degreemy question is strongly feel that if 2030 of this powerful content creators get together in 2035 maybe they will be enough money power Fame cloud and good intent to collectively form a new political movement and animal various theories that is true that is 100% true because I was reflecting on something similar yesterday where I watch Top 5 minute add of aok bye carryminati for 5 minutes ok that's his power right now ok I am his big fan I am is big fan since 2018 ok and I watched it and that's his powers as a few months ago there was news at carryminati is going to go in Bigg Boss Bigg Boss Bigg Boss season 2 when it is power he has power over traditional celebrities and he is 21 years old so he has to decide where that power goes and that is going to happenmobile phones and access to internet becomes available to more and more people we are going to see more and more carryminati's less than that of water purifier being at 50 million honestly once and an entire population is YouTube salary you will see at least 20 30 50 million youtubers come out of this country definitely definitely the handover of power that going to happen in the country over the next 10 years itself that will be politicalagain is a question because as I said the political the political aspect of India is a little messed up even if you want to bring in a legislative change if you want to pass a bill basically then you have to go through all of procedures and for that you have to get elected I am not sure whether there will be enough intent from people to go from protesting to passing on into being an actual political leader capitalist I have to ask this questionthat you can actually change the country waymo with a lot of money and staying out of politics are when entering politics and grabbing the Bull by the time you have good policies directed by and misappropriated for example if you want to set up a solar power plant a solar panel on your house or wherever the government gives you subsidy for itthe government will probably by 40% of the subsidy for it if you open a business in a woman's name in a rural area and I know this because I have family friends who opened the cashew businesses in Maharashtra so he was able to get loans at an affordable rate because he started the whole business on his wife's name so that is there you can get a lot of discounts on a discounts Ne discounts not the right word a subsidies oncapital expenditure on plant and machinery so you have a lot of these policies in place but the thing is we're not released every with those policies so I was reading an article on the better India I know when a long time ago that there is one group of people just youngsters who are all I think in the legal profession and what they do is the dress code different rural areas and the explain government schemes to people so that they canfree apply themselves and take benefit from so a lot of policies are in place a lot of people from a very long time ok I am not bifurcating between any government sale order schemes have been in place for a lot of different years people don't know about them so that the private sector can really contribute that is where somebody who has a lot of money who has that intent of doing something good just money is notfrom India you need intent because money is something that Goosebumps are you serious money in India people think India is a poor country but the Ijazat the divide between rich and poor is very very vast and you have a lot of people who are in 84 bracket that why I have something to the sun is again coming from my own self obsessed youtuber side of me but onevery deep impact on this and I honestly I ask myself that exist until question 1 YouTube began in my life fitness conversation then I really felt a call him some meaningful work began talking about Entrepreneurship and also come to realise because of all the people of network with which are capitalist massive so message Businessman all the mermaid money and now forgottennot the goal of life and to create an impact and should be so blessed to be youtubers and creators BE first create in back and money also comes in a big way so it's a great position to be but a my first I'll tell you have my permission I want to ask about job if you'll have to define a book that one paragraph what it would be my own purposes that I have figured that I will never be that mainstream commercial content creator and I will always have to be that guy who helps breed new entrepreneurs because that's what comes out of the Moonthe first time we metals are always pushti all along with business and adjust its comes appropriate place near college Nache people along that business standard life and I strongly believe that if we create a maximum of ethical entrepreneurs in this country and even rule that were actually change the country where more than entering politics and only I also I also feel that with the entrepreneurs you have to tap into creating regional content must return The Economist at homeare you one thing where I feel original content will boom and its creators a smart then there are a lot of opportunities so one aspect of the new education policy because the problem in our country is people will not read the actual policy with every article that decodes the forces are relying on that authors you know duration editing the author's editing of what is important so if this this ifstress or even if this is done right it can possibly lead us to the India you are talking about so what the government wants to do what they are planning to do in terms of education is bifurcate the first few years of your life and early childhood care and education ECE where they are going to a possible teach you in the local language of your mother tongue which can be helpful for a lot of people in rural areas because if they use to luck for examKarnataka for example people in an absolute Tower there will no Kannada only right to expect them to speak English they may speak broken Hindi but their bases Kannada so for those kids to learn in Kannada over there it's easier for the brain to adapt in Kannada and then you teach them more languages so a part of the policy is that they want to show them cultural aspects of that state through audioand this is where are you feel if content creators and state governments work well it could be of shoes path for original content because you will have someone from Maharashtra saying ok create lekin abcs of Maharashtra for me in Marathi for me so that I can show it in all government school kids because then they will say for Ajanta Caves bhaje caves and Ellora so then they will know what is a part of their state they will knownative language I feel like this is one huge content of the unity that nobody is looking at if played write a 100% sure of you statesville latch onto it a few States may not but the ones the latch onto it and their creators who can get into the space will be amazing because I also not like in terms of you know vision like imagine your face and yourboys feel volume everybody about what is your state in 5 minutes in the points and have you heard about this year we called a Maslow's hierarchy but you might need to explain seep hierarchy of needs is like in simple words are basically you have three basic needs like water food shelterwhat loading food shelter and clothing then as you fulfill those needs you go 1 higher level 1 higher level 1 higher level at the top of those needs are self esteem and self actualization needs of all these people who have achieved everything in their lives they have a car how many more hours with you won't even if they buy the best car they will still have a lot of money left what will they do with that money you will nature said that they will give that money backthis is a theory is a Theory that people teach in psychology and many people believe in that you're so that is where capitalism can go right that we give people so much that they don't know what to do with it but good how it can work outthis one message businesswoman PO last year we had a very interesting panel on the future of transport transport is something you really think of consciously special content of the logistics bird and the future of transport back panel was primarily about flying cars and like what is the current state of line Kasaragod like a Gaya thing from food to talk about what food is currently doing for the future of long as they got a guy from what is the Richard Bransonvirgin Hyperloop and one more transport that and they started talking about when flying cars are likely to be outside in the high Polymers Gurgaon 1023 2020-2024 and tentatively flying as a supposed to come out in the 2030 sometime I spoke to my friends who does a lot of work in rural India is at the moment flying cars become a possibilityis going to make all of rural India extremely rich because that's one of the big problems that they are truly disconnected from the rest of the country a lot of growth in rural India people leave rule but they're going to change of everything in this is just one aspect of things going by how many technological advancement are going to happen with their again and recommend you will know Harish books which are always in every what does you need to read that guy to understand where the world is going and is no one was thatLoafer is known as put it out as well as he has for the world so keep in mind futuristic technology in Avinash you had been know that you read about future technologies I know that are extremely well informed the present where is India going based on the current technologies are being developed because I know people like Radhakrishnan Pillai Manish Pandey a very hopeful that India will become some kind of technological capital in the highly possible that we become but then we have toset an environment for inventors to stay over your already we are seeing that shift that the top so use of the top companies in the world are Indians but we need to give them some sort of incentive to stay in India and try to figure out some of the Indian problems as well as we can see that Sundar Pichai is doing a lot for India I mean he has put of those Wi-Fi station Indian Railways to provide somelot of stations near not layer means to not be Kurla station on main Bombay wala system stations in rural areas Gujarat Gujarat mein Amul is coming because the CEO of the company has seen all those problems and probably at the back of his mind he has Indiaproblem is doing that we have to in the incentive ise engineers and inventors to stay your do something over your again again the thing is I stay very hopeful for the future but as long as the people in the present don't ask those questions to themselves why are we doing what we're doing why are we entering into the stream because of the way it stands today does money everywhere there is money in if you work hard doesquantify the statement like if you work hard and content creation there is money if you work hard in a business in putting up a Startup that is money if you look at something as unwanted as waste then there is money because there is one lady she returned from the US to her family in Hyderabad and her family was someone who contracted a lot with poultry farmers and all of that stuff so when shethere she noticed a lot of poultry dropping ki iska waste ka problem hota hai to then she got an idea Si process poultry dropping into biogas her biogas is used as cooking fuel at Akshay Patra Patra is place in USA then they provide all Mid day meals biogas is used instead of natural gas that is extracted it iswhere is money everywhere what was she doing she is handling waste handling you know check input at a gain of this is entrepreneurial Spirit by SP laddu some Jugaad but figure out how to make money also exposure exposure because she has come back from there there is a good connect that the nature of doing something good for the society came from the Indian roots but how to do it came from exposure to the westabroad ask themselves fundamental questions were not gonna ask themselves have a good to make money but then they'll ask ok how do we solve this problem how to solve this problem if you get if you can't of listen to Steve Jobs is speed whether it's the Oxford commencement or anything else that he was doing he kept asking himself how can I do this how can I solve this how can I make type want more attractive calligraphy how can I solvepeople ask how we can solve this problem I feel there in admin at large that people who probably do that but at large we don't ask me how we can solve it but how does it feel thatdose of today are like two generations apart from a very different from us I just hope that they utilise good content we have a lot of 16 17 Rose writing into a single I wanna makeup right in thinking that I was thinking about this football matchsearch for the singer not find it very nice thing that you said that if we have to make a vision statement for this line has to be the that we want to create content that we would like to watch like I will have to answer capitalistic question you can slide the controversial what is your opinion on used in the modern mainstream news unconsciously stays away from it not because I ate a something I just figured that it's not for me and I would rather getfrom Abhi and you and say other Europe was a good citizen Jewellers using the plot is national news is only focusing on what happening in a few places and they are making a method of everythingPRP treatment to the many things do the masses care about everybody will care about very few things is not the same on the other hand there are some very good quality pieces that come what do you mean by good journalism andGangadhar Patil somebody who is from Belgaum and he started reporting for mainstream media and then he saw that it's floor the model is plot and then he created a platform called 11 reporters where they they are trying to connect stories from local news LIC regional stories and getting them to these big news portals that just feeling this gap and if you have seen the series on NetflixTara the story was brought forward by them so that is the power of regional news that is a power of actual journalism on field the people who are local people the people who has seen everything over there who can bring those important stories on a national platform and now an international card form 2 the regional news people have good enough abilities and good enough backing to keep Google it is backing am or entirely sure ofking is where the whole entrepreneurs and the whole capitalism conversation comes in it I mean that support that you to ja to cut 8 Mahina ismein West kar lekin Achcha news when we give that sort of freedom to people the people were really passionate about bringing out good stories bring out the real stories then it will definitely work national news is it it'sfeels very Page3 like it feels very artificial it it doesn't feel like that's what you might think of a person that any normal person may think of practically like if you read anything about food or something you have NDTV food talking about a lot of different things from a global perspective but when you talk about Indian food thoda lightly Karenge at one point of time India had one10,000 varieties of rice and nobody talks about something like this at present because there are dedicated people who can serve rise you have you know I think around 67000 varieties have been concerned but the rest have been lost so this is not something that mainstream media picks up but smaller publications like I frequently read better India because the better India talks only about positive news actionoriented news 16 talk about IAS officers were doing a good job will talk about entrepreneur so doing a good job and it's feels good reading it so I talk about that and that's very few the missing the point ki what is the essence of India you are not capturing that what is what is Bharat what are the people and that is not getting captured that is if you are missing the mark question but what's stopping you all from starting abhi and newlike your own version of Times Now or Republic over I want to call it because if I put my money on people inside the rock and need these people to begin on you celebrate on you guys so what is stopping on a personal level when we scale at a height chances of using the plot as well because the if we have 10 people working on 10 stories we may not be able to keep that sort of quality control and the are best to get the good people on boardultimately people choices and peoples reporting will be based on their opinions ultimately if you are again this example also comes from US book that in the future if we design a machine that hire people that replaces HR entirely then maybe that engineer CAD can feed in his buyers of not hiring black people just because he was a racist into that it is very difficult for a soto ab you know make sure that the same quality is repeated everyone so right now we are happy we are happy with what we are doing right now when we feel confident that yes we need to become a news portal as well we will definitely think about it is right now I feel like the problem with news is you come you do half an hour segment and an Ho Gaya aapka Ho Gaya and we don't feel like we are that sort of people like when we picked upagriculture which is the burning issue in news these days we found that there was so much to be discussed the so much to be talked about like people always think ki India mein khana kam hai khana Milta Nahin Hai Logon Ko but India as a food supplies country so the food the Government procurements food grains and stores it in godowns and I'm asking this question can you guess how much food the government already has in their ko dance right now I don'trandom big number of 100 turnsFood Food Corporation of India godowns are there in the corporation and perhaps but at our level we want to take it one step forward in Idea it ok to have food supplies what can be done in terms of food management forgot to add on this for the sale of the your solution oriented which is like it's if the that the biggest reason of Grown also as a consumerno news channel no citizen releases are solution oriented about solution oriented watchinguske liye millions of users not people with Dekha Hai India mein ek Kami hai lekin logon ko ek karna chahie Karke Chhod Dete Hain matlab kya hai as something as we are and we go like karna haiAise Karke Aise 5000 Nagar baithkar Kuchh Karenge then this guy is focusing on agriculture this guy is focusing on law and bringing in content together and foods and so much heart in it that it is better than what we are doing right now then yes definitely tell me something called love me and you TV in the future bright only see and feel like the thing that made our journey with solution oriented content started with the Ganpati video becausehappened models of his family used to get a Ganpati for all these years and his grandfather's came to Bombay and then they started that tradition used to do it 40 years have one person from whom we get this one Murti Murti it has not changed your pattern same and in 2018 we got married and near the proposed an idea that why not we get an eco-friendly Murti with without any pain I am like thismy department ok I am not I am not that Puja paath Gaya will be in front of in front doing the Aarti I am the one who will be the end of the department will pass on the idea to the grandfather who takes charge of this year so he said why not send me the price of it was slightly higher but he paid for it he is light Kitna Hua Mujhe bol dungashow that if our family can change why not right for more people why not just tell people that there is an option available and you take it because it is the Ganpati video was your can you see videos post the event of a cry in a river and apply ke kya ya Ganpati ki Murti Kaise Bhagwan ko to message karte hodesperate for a little and advanced when people can take an action and we did it and it it really worked really well I am we did not expect anything we made that we slept at 10:30 we were somewhere in Karnataka and next day we wake up viale ki cal Tak 5000 followers Instagram par at 8000 to 10000what's your viewpoint on where the world of Indian social media as going right now about se Tiktok influencer viewpoint on like the rest and everything from YouTube to short contentknow about what they are doing is because I feel like social media has become a reflection of you know it because it's not a place where people create content is a place where people come in for the Fame for the day because I want that Brandy like want to make XX money through my content and I want to put out those pieces only I want to you know do something that is that andvast majority of it is like back creators of course as there are everywhere but by and large this is how I see social media as that's the reason why it's so toxic because everybody is in it or not everybody is enough for the right reasons everybody is in it so I mean selfishly also we depend on social media for livelihood To Ham bhi views are like kar rahe hai but at the end of the day people are not looking at it for anything moremy perspective about social media is really simple the really successful people are really honest with who they are they are not trying to be somebody else ok you can only come up to a certain level of your copying somebody else and after that if you want to really really succeed then you have to bring in your own identity and that's what people actually fall in love with people actually fall in love with her passionately she speaks about menstrual cupsthat's what people fall in love with because that's the identity so she can speak really passionate about even if you are a comedian if you are bringing in your personal life your personal passions into something that people can watch and white carefully live your life then yes that person will be really successful in social media final question of this episode is after this regard to very funny episodeLast Man on this one does India look like in 2050 and I'm asking you this because you all study India in detail day and day out so where you'll see that going on 30 years we need some actual reforms we definitely need some actual reforms and the reforms will have to start start from politics there has been a great movement to bring all the elections in one year somebody is saying that why do we haveexchange AP state elections Amin for example Maharashtra state elections fall on the same in the same year when the central election but right now Bihar elections are happening what that certain person is saying why to invest every year in figuring out political rallies less decide 1 year let's do all the political rallies that your the rest 4 years let's focus on work this is something that definitely shouldand as a view of a person will ask definitely should happen some minor things that have been said before you are reading a report that was made In 2003 about how the law needs to change in India and the first line in that report is that everything that he was a right now has already been said before the problem is nobody listensprenup bill changes in political science which committee committee committee which was made In 2003 about how the justice system in criminal justice system so 2003 after that how many governments change 12344 governments changed ok for election 74 government change the government that was in powerthat time that government also came in power twice but still not happen without seeing is so and this will only happen when the youth protest for the right reasons there are a lot of protests happening but the objectives of those protest are very short term that needs to change and if that happens then definitely50 will be a bright future will be a bride this may be me being self obsessed but I see content creating the changes that have been mentioned that Swades had a deep impact on all our life there has to be content creators in 1 when it in 2014-15 that created something about what's the internetwhich changes will be a lot more vibrant and a little more in depth with a little more perspective he has a different perspective I am looking at 2050 India from a completely environment perspective and that outlook is not very theory to study of you saying India is the most water stressed country on the planet we have 16GB not close to like it in place and thepopulation because we don't stop producing kids and we have less than 3% of the world's freshwater resources which we're losing very rapidly if have you been to Punjab ever rural Punjab FC nowadays it if Punjab continues to form the way it does in 25 years Punjab will be a desert because I have no ground water left all these things that we eatrice sugar it requires a lot of water geyser water the growing crops but because our certain political aspect is in such a way as distorted in in in that way people continue to produce it in spite of having buffer stocks and so we continue to draw back more water in our top soil is gone if you eat wheat your not getting any nutrients you have to eat fruits we have to eat milletsin 2050 if you are not kaffle it's it's going to be Chaos because order any steps being taken to fix this situation small sporadic steps on individual level I believe I have read that this year as a part because I want to increase work given to people under MANREGA the made them construct rainwater harvesting pits across India to give them employeeTo Kuchh ho raha hai but not enough knowledge is there on the topic not enough knowledge of adverse water uses like I think at when Mumbai was active on the amount of water Mumbai wood waste would be equal to the amount of water Pune consumes so I don't matlab if you are not careful right now I don't see a bright future for ISC if you're not carefulthe flow of Ganga will become one third by 2050 and if so it will wipe out one third of India ok now if you have to reach that upper layer of politics you have to have some level of intellect so my point is why doesn't the person at the top of the people at the top of my state government National governments why don't think get the best in the business to fix this problem like environment because any problem fixing needsthe people were here are only thinking about five years longer than five years it is a problem with the entire country we don't want to fix the problems deeply it is way easier to waive off your loan rather than making sure that your next generation has water going to wait who's going to think 20 years before before 20 years ago this guy help me so that right now I have better educationright now I can take better care of my farm land but if you just view of their Loan at least that your that person is happy again take alone and he will again have that situation the financial crisis but that's the short-term solution we focus on the short-term solutions and not a long-term solution because of this entire hotspot of a situation that India is in that every 5 years will be an election and you have to win that perception game everybody is doing what iswhat is right possibly could the future of this country entirely in entrepreneurs hands it has been a diverse society is hands because it is given to an entrepreneur you can call Konkan entrepreneur you can call Pepsi an entrepreneur yet when Coke Coke Pepsi and the Three most top plastic pollution in the world and have done nothing about it and Pepsi are routinely go to which have a playBihar across the world and credit office water supply to sell you bottled water or to sell you cold drinks which are sugar and god knows what so they are doing at their entrepreneur so to speak with you can leave the country in their hands you have to have a vibrant society that is filled with people from all different patterns you need to have people who have different thoughts wali need to have people who are looking at and chainyou need a teacher in need a social reformer you need Everybody from every perspective we can have taken over a presentation of entrepreneurs you are you can have that spirit you can't baby the leadership might come out of the every company starts off with something nice that every company starts of a line and Batman that you are a hero within you end up becoming I will you live long enough to see yourself become the wind millbig companies because scale is an issue for example if you have to change packaging from plastic to go something eco-friendly you don't have to think about hundred bottles you have to think about hundred million bottle and that sort of change is not going to come unless the government has ki cal se plastic Ban as at baje se kisi ke pass plastic bottle Nahin Hoga if the government said that when there will be a good everybody has to contribute and theirgold need to be that they need to think in the right direction what are you up 2015 positives like reducing India going right what's going good What's going good is the number one thing as going good is access more accessible to people I mean as

wale ka ladka ya Budhiya ya Bura Mat Kar Aap Kahin Se Bhi Shuru kar sakte hain per aap Jahan se shuru karo Uske Piche pad Jana Jab tak usmein aap Excel Nahin Karte to Ek dusre Mein Mat Karna Apna Ek simple Sa usool Sadak per Jaan kutta na Puche per Paisa Itna Na Chaho rigid Lijiye Izzat Itni Milani chahie as an artist is a famous person I don't want to be known for I have for having a big name I want to be known for being a very good artistDylan Nair bhai kaise ho Ranveer bhai I am good Raftaar ji what name the property for sale in diode you prefer of the former bhai is it to different people or is it just me or Mera Koi Aisi psychological reason nahin hai ki mera ek second personality hai vo Bharat Hai Tumhen superhero feel karta hun Aisa Kuchh Bhi Nahin very simple dalon is the dreamer and Raftaarbhai what your story because this is the first time we are meeting and anyone can read your story of the internet and all that but I want to hear from you are ki story kya hai padhaai belong to a family of people who have never been into the entertainment industry in any way on plus they were not privileged enough to do so and also Ek tarike se apne school ka Bagi bacchon Mein who fought for his dreams and became who I am because his mum and dad supported Kafi Logon SamanTu I am the end result of my mum and dad dreams as well so that is how in in short I can define myself because the journey so long Bhai Ki there are so many aspects to it so lambi lambi connect the dots in a very simple way I started off dancing when I was really young then I started teaching because in my college where are you students are they called us to a studio the owner of the studio told me you done so well why did it is the kids and they offered me some money hundred bucksK pocket and that good pocket money right so I started unit teaching without any experience in teaching or knowing how the basics of dances I would go back home study of clips and go back into the kids and then it slowly Guru Randhawa ke like a senior instructor at the same time wanted to create music was an Avid fan Kyunki if you know in college festivals whenever your dancing you create this medleys of short write for people to dance on so I was the one in charge in my whole crew so that serve my benchinto producing music gana was already writing staff before and because it is like a whole complete culture I was dancing to the same group and that groove lead to me writing on floor on because most I like a lot of kids ask me ki how do you write on beat how we come up with the floors it helps me being a dancer really helps right and from that journey the dancer decided I have joined in another collected enough money saved enough now go to Studios and do stuff awayBangalore so then I took it really seriously stepped away from dancing for a bit and then went to music and slowly and steadily everything happens for me and while I was dancing I had done a couple of reality shows like Dance India Dance had done back then and now into a lot like last year I became the judge of the same show so my life is like a complete full circle when you are getting into music like what's that first step live side ki you transition from dance and music but howyoung kid get into music today X musician banne ke liye koi ek particular Rasta Nahin Hai Jo Aap chunenge Ki Yahi se Jaunga to musician Manva Kyunki it depends on what is on dry or getting into Kuchh log Jaise Rock banate hain mein Apne Apne line se thoda baat karo Jo Rock banate hain usse kuch log play drums bajana start karte hain Kuchh log pahle guitar Baja Le aur Usi Mein Excel karte hain Kuchh log sirf bhukhe sote Hue usmein sale Karte Kuchh log team Mein Aise Bhi Hote Hain Jo Na Karte Hain Na Koicement bajate Hain but they are probably the writers of the group but there are also musicians Right To Kya Karun ke shabd Nahin Honge Vas melody Mein Nahin sochega to aap usko Aage product Kaise banaa paoge to yah Sare jitne

organ Jo video musically Ek element Dal sakte hainyou are very good arranges Jo Insan ko kat kat ke arrangement Itni Pyari Karte Hain Ki kahan per music gana chahie kahan per Ruk Jana chahie kahan per

market Mein To aap alag Kyon Howhy is it that I am a different rapper why do people need to listen to me Kyunki Agar unko rapper sunaiye to vah to bahut Logon Sun sakte hain jab tak aap apni Ek Unique Identity Apna tone Apna type ka floor apni presentation Nahin dhundh per tab tak National Kuchh kar Pana yah Logon ki najron mein aap Aana bahut Mushkil Hai Lekin example use my brother you keep your

very positive direction and trying to create something which cannot sustain my life in the future but a lot of people who are you know with me in this journey when I talk to you I feel ki you are very ambitious for sure you are also very you have a vision about where you are taking things so when you are 80 years old what do you want to be known for your music your business the people you helped I

jaruri hai everybody took on the commercial Road commercial route ke bad Hip Hop ko Itni value Mil Gai ki jo Chahte Apni Taraf Se vah Dhire Dhire commercial site Chhod rahe hain India becoming more Hip Hop on the mainstream level it takes time bromo it is a journey to main 80 saal ki Umar mein dekhna chahta hun Ki Main Ghar Baithe ki TV on Karun to 8 Usi tarike se present ho raha hun Jis tarike se Ham Chahte Hain man meinki kis chij ki rok Nahin Hai freedom of speech Ek Chhota Sa example Dunga Pro you probably will relate to it when Ham Apne mom-dad ke sath Jab gadi mein ghumte hain aur chalate hain to Puri Gadi ke andar sirf ham log Hote Hain Jo Apna Sar bump kar rahe the mean but 10 to 20 years down the line when we are with around kids who will get you anywhere understand music and deeply Hip Hop it will be both of us probably all of us in the car so it takes time for the journey to happen and will issuethankful also how the audience has quickly learnt everything and adapted to it Kyunki pixel Hip Hop for the black people for hip hop to spread it took a lot of years from rhyming to pass time in the Cotton fields where they were you know acting as slaves where they were going through that they were pushed down they were crushed in that situation but they were spending time with each other while driving to it leading to an era where to end gun fight scene gang violence they started doing Rap Battles seaportvery intricate part of them from 60-70 is the Bronx came in people started doing you know throwing block parties people joined in from their became the error of Gangster app from Gangster about was all housefly you are how how many much Bling you have it was an error of Bling rappers now it's almost like an error of mostly drugged out rappers most most amazing out in the best but that is also a journey by these guys covered write in so many years India ko dekho yaar main manta hun 2000Tumhen Paisa Nasha Pyar I Thi jismein Bohemia Paji ka gana tha Kali Denali vahan Se Lekar 2020 13 Sal mein India Ne movie banaa Di 100 banaa Diya Hip Hop ke upar Dehradun law of documentaries on it a lot of International Raipur have signed people not a lot of North side divine that is like a very big thing cause Hamare liye is like a legend Mein Naman unko sunte Hue 1 Mai ki sunte Hue Bade hue hain he comes to India to China gay to cover that journey13 years is a big deal signed by but is there any American other than those who is winner personal inspiration for you are who you feel ki young rappers should be studying grown Logon mein kya hota na dekho you don't study somebody learn how to selectively study somebody which is very necessary for example the game the game is a rapper and admire lot Mere Hath Mein uska tattoo bhi hai bhai yah Mein dikha raha hun kyaI am so inspired by him he has a very bad past theek hai yeh sold drugs he has been in drivewise he has been shot at alone could truly alagapuri body many survived but after he became a rapper and when he grew up everything that he did after that is what defines a person right you cannot change somebody's past that is something I got inspired by per Hota kya Kijiye Bihar Ke Log Bharat Dekhte aur bolate Hain Ki yaar yah Lene Pi rahe hain yadrugs kar rahe hain aap ka matlab Nahin Hota Ham ko bahut sara Sona 15 padega Humko thoda Ghadi Badi leni padegi vah wala wala Jo pressure hota hai na vah pressure bhi sath mein log Sikh Jaate Hain so kisi ko bhi Sikho Dena lot of people out there who have done bad things but have also done a lot of good things just learn the good selective selective analysis if someone had to selectively analyse you by what should the pickup from you and what he did not pick up from yoube stubborn in the right women ok that is what they should pick up from me and something they should not take UP NIC khana chahie bilkul hua hai ki itni jaldi Sab pe trust Mat Kiya Karo that everybody is hai to be your brother or your sister forever just be very safe and cautious as to what you doing because initially I used to share everything with a lot of people you know meet everybody that reached the phase where peopleexpected so much out of me because of the love I showered on them that when I was not able to provide it the became like my friend images in ovary me so no don't put yourself in that position don't put yourself in that position what's the darkest 3 moments of a past with you feel ki yaar because of the three moment I am what I am today first moment was when my mum was called every Saturday to my school Har Saturday ko school mein BulayaCup para teachers meeting Hoga iska pura Chitthi se kam se lekar Jaenge to Hath se mummy Aati Thi Aur Shaitan hone ki vajah Se Bhari anti-bullying portion Jiske Se Badi Ladai hoti Thi anyhow mum ko Mafia Baat Mangi padati Thi that is something you know that it's time Pata Fark nahi padta sorry Bole the Rote the bridge when you grow up and you realise what you have put your mum the position they put your mum and that is that was something that hit me aur mera mostly nostalgiaanother document for me was which made me realise a lot of things was when my dad one day I Maine sev Halka kabhi kabhi kuch bol deta tha jaise kuch Mang liya Kuchh Ho Gaya to Ek Din Mere Papa Ne Aake Mere ko Bade usse bola ki beta to Safai wale ka ladka ya Budhiya ya Bura Mat Kar you know that just hit me so much ki yaar he is that is his death his job right but ho mere ko Koi Kami Nahin dete Kisi bhi chij Ki napak Kisi Ko realise Hota Haisim card love in the society to mere ko pressurized nahin karna chahie Dava the moment my brother III moment was when I'd actually I was in a crew and I had to leave it because a certain reasons and had to read I have to restart my entire journey and that was another face that changed me as a person completely as an IT Made Me Do It made me focus more on what I wanted now Ki Mala mein aur Ziddi Bangalore stubborn ok Ki Ab Chakkar nahi haialbum ke gane Mein bola bhi hai ki yah Dua beta Sidha show per Milenge to that was three movements were like a really hard time and what doesn't break you make human and represent bhai everyone knows that you Honey Singh Badshah all came up together so you'll actually witness that rise of rap in India together and I'm sure it on a personal level so you also your life changing Aise I want overnight but over a few yearsthing must change for all very rapidly together so what did you learn from the success and what did you learn from the mistakes that three awful made in that face like the way you look that now what do you find a highlight for yourself brother like I say whatever happens happens for a reason Yahi Hamari destiny Lekha Jokha hai theek hai main usmein se Agar Kuchh Bhi Mita Dunga to Shayad Aaj Main Vo Insan Nahin rahunga Jo Main Aaj hun I am very happy happy with myself anarchybecause of everything bad and everything that happens I was able to create this shelf right now now success for me personally was an overnight because everybody had a different way of coming Apna sabse pahle Hamare bich Mein who blew up was Honey by Honey Singh then the person who delivers Badshah Bhai with Saturday Saturday after that he never stop I came into existence properly in 2014 and swagc.so Honey bhai became bhajan 2011 Badshah Bhai became really big Kahate Hain Ki you have made a mark ruffalo you dreams to ab dekho Sab ke aur bhi bahut bade bade the Badshah Bhai 2012 and in 2014 it was easy for me to aise hi Ham teeno mein se sabka and it's just not as bro Hamare sath mein time pakka tha Hamare sign sath mein sim per Golu tha and there were a lot of people in Chandigarh remember that was this through quality Bheem usmeinApna Parichay bhai bhi Hua Karta Tha Parichay ka dusra Naam Pradhan Pradhan Naam Se Jana Jata Hai Sar aap hi still you doing very good history present his route to aise coffee log Lage the commercial success Ham teenon Ko Mili Thi I don't want to take away from any of these guys because these guys were also busy building the foundation Jahan per Ham soch rahe Ki Nahin yaar commercial karna padega ki usse Roti Aati Hai use chij Badi hoti hai usse baat bhi hoga use time per yah log David Berryto the art form they are involved with aur vo sirf Vahi streethiphop kar rahe the feel of the with my journey I realised ki main thoda sa commercial Karke audience Din Karke unko Ek Aisa material De sakta hun janseva delete kar Sakenge yah Hip Hop Hai To donon chijon ke bich mein balance karna bahut jaruri tha mere liye to I think everybody chose dheron per later on but the come up in the dreaming was together but Honey bhai is awish you need to ask man like a Khadke Glassy kimat 2006-7 right Mira college first year khatm bhai is time to sirf music English mein likha ja raha tha aur Bahar walon ki beat per likha ja raha tha Usi time Paisa Nasha Pyar Aaya use time per Khadke Glassy Ho Gaya Aaya so these guys Bohemia Paji Problem from 2005 Before any drop the source mixtape and Honey bhai 2006 Khadke Glassy became very prominent name but what did the commercial success bring inin terms of Darkness like I know I am sure now you are a much more mature version of yourself from this just the respect take respect of an MCG se bar Kahate Street credibility right so that is what I always felt I left because even if you listen to my commercial numbers usmein bhi mein bahut acche tarike se board play karna ek message chhodana you know the spirit of NMC is to leave a message with everything it has right to vo wala part Mera Thoda MS Outlook 95 the Logon Ko wala partso it used to hurt them see inside of me but then after you know Swag Mera desi Hai I like I said I kept doing the balancing act ki Thoda Thoda Hip Hop Dal Diya thoda commercial Bhi Kya Kyunki log samajhte Nahin aaj ki date Mein Mere time pata hai aapko appreciate bhi nahin kara ja raha tha Jis time per main Lena was trying to invade the space but bro in terms of in terms of Darkness water drink like in terms of something you like are yaar ok theek hai you want to learn how to handle itvinod ki paise sab log ke bus Ki Baat Nahin Hota Mere Sath aisa koi problem nahin tha per mere ko yah bad Mein Sama Jana laga ki Yaar Ki Jab aap ka naam hota hai to aapka koi bhi action will be counted for accounted for you will matlab Kuchh Bhi Ho Agar aapane majak Mein bola ho ya Kuchh pareshani bola tha everything becomes really serious but mere ko uski vajah se shuruaat Mein Kuchh face nahin karna bada bhi recently he bahut Kuchh Hua aapkifreedom of speech what effect Ho Jaati Hai but like I chose my part I don't mens my words Mein Khul Ke Bolta Jo Mujhko feel hota hai yahi job Sawal Apne pahle poochh Hota To Shayad main thoda Bada ke Aangan Mein Jawab de raha tha Baki chijon ka write about how you came of what happened now like you said you reach Phase I am so much I am glad that happened because that defined whom I am today are you happy in life now bro arey bhai bahut Kusum what do you want you happy about I am happyable to do what I love man that's about it it's not the money it's not having that name it is you know I keep repeating this it goes back to that 16 year old kid who dreamt of being who I am today and I'm glad he tripped you know that is what I am happy about that I am glad that he was a dreamer bro can you take me through your full process for songwriting and know someone who writes his own lyrics + I'm sure you think of Beats and all that yourself and produce myself by your own architect of your own musicwhat else dependency zaroori what is a process bro Ek particular process hanok Ivory kya hota hai ki I like I am I am an Avid beatmaker as well I love making beep in fact I make Morbi teneright music ok Jalebi Banane Baitha To kahibari Aisi beach Ban Jaati Hai jisse Pata hota hai ki yah Iske Upar Mein Kuchh Aise banaa sakta hun like there's a song album called popular it is about how I don't want to be popular it's about how I don't want fame but I want to save money that I am receiving todayki Apna Ek simple Sa usool Sadak per Jaan kutta na Puche per Paisa Itna Na Chaho rigid frame Lijiye Izzat Itni Mili Thi as an artist not as a famous person I don't want to be known for I have for having a big name I want to be known for being a very good artist process easily as a raha hai ki agar main Kuchh Bhi beat banane ki koshish kar raha hun to uske andar sabse pahle uska topic Sochta Hun Ki Iske Upar topic Jaega theek hai use topic Se Kya Hota ki mujhe pahle 2 lines Mein jaati aurtwo line Mein Jaati Hai To fir bar ki kahani like I said ki you need to exercise your brain in a way that you can't write bad aap galat likhi likhi Nahi Sakte vah use plastic automatically aapko FIR Khud Aage Le jata hai so that is the process and then then I you know then its arrangement for sale deed on the entire song We recorded or record karne ke bad Mein usko Khud Hi arrange karta hun arrange karne ke bad finally if I feel like Ki Yaari music Main banaa liya per ismein se bhi Baithe Kuchh Hona chahie Aise BhiJo Kuchh add Hona Mujhse Ho nahin hai mujhe samajh Nahin a Raha probably yah to main technical Itna Achcha Nahin ya FIR mujhe pata nahin counter kaise pahunchta hai then I reached out to other people then I give them The song Like The dummy format purv rough sketch Man ko de deta project ke Taur per aur uske bad was built karna chalu karte hain and then it goes to mixing stages but I am make sure I am involved in all of these stages involved Nahin rahunga to it will not be hua meri Pehchan Legi it will not be my sound bike andeven become a rapper or do you need some god-given talents know you're the only talent you need is the bill to be educated on that is also not a talent in admin anybody can become a rapper Pro Kyunki Agar aapke pass vocabulary hai aur Agar Ek Hi chij Ko Bar Bar sunane ja rahe ho sab Sab cricket khelna Kaise sikhe Lete Hain Ki Sidha papa ke sath battery ke maidan Mein Jaate Hain Chhote plastic ki bol ke sath nobody goes to this weekin the beginning to learn write it is because we watch it so much and we learnt so much that it becomes a part of you like live cricket watch cricket score India that is what Hip Hop should be for you and if you are an event listener because you are a very good listener you listen to so many people you will be able to absorb everything there said and then you will start writing rhymes aap likhna chalu Karoge FIR Khud uska meaning Judwaa shuruaat Mein Nahin Judwaa bad Mein Khud Judwaa 2 yah Ek process Hai is like there isKoi Aasan Tarika Tu Hai bhi nahin bhai but what do you after you had just stick to the process creates songs 100% hundred percent by matlab initially for example I am giving example because I see you as somebody who murdered and at this young age and you know a lot of kids definitely idolize human ki matlab mere ko mere ko bhi Aisa Kyon banana mere ko bhi Aisi type ka podcast karna hai everybody get inspired by someone Tumne Bhi pahle Kitna interview letter time and was a first interview problems Hai be likeAgar Main Kisi ka interview Lunga ya koi podcast Banaunga ya Kisi chij Ko cover Karunga Kisi per Yad Karunga yah Maine from doing something comical how are the people can reactivate that lives here right 100% you get added to buy Mera Ziddi Ban Kitna Piche pad Gai Ham aapko Samne se puchna bada bhai Hamen Pramod kar do I need to reach man you need to be mad about something you need to be added after 8 months Ki Jaan nikal do Jab Tum Aisa Lage ki ismein Aage padhne ke liye aur kuchh hi nahin bro Sawantunderstand about us ki you are an artist in your heart you are an artist do you know you find yourself on the TV industry in Bollywood very glamorous Industries to what do you not like about those Industries because an artist is also very good observer I feel so what we observed about glamour Industry that you don't enjoy do I still don't have a lot of people who are from the industry glamour side of it Jahan out synonym Pyar Ko Nazar bacha ke Rakha you will not find me you will not find me at a lot of what showsnot find me at previous you will not find me at music releases in this and that because main usse apne aap ko to because I feel like it is not necessary I don't need to go and indulge and you know say hello to people just for the sake to aap mere ko relevant some Jaaye to Fir to Fir To Mere Mera Mere Hath ki bhejti hai ya nahin to main climate se thoda Dur rahata Hun Main Itna clubs of bhi nahin Gata my life has all Si Manik eklauta baccha hun so I never had brothers and sisterspeople who took care of my friends were people around right so I still keep the same people around I have kalamkar with me in kalamkar then I'm in Delhi Karma lives at my place hum saath mein rehte hain wo dil ko main Bombay bhej diya union is also a member of kalamkar Union in fact has been with me for around 10 years like I met him as a teacher and I love them so much that they brought him back to Delhi with me and the Tab Se Lekar Aastha Ko Mere Saathi hai to maine apne Bande select Karke nokkathe kar rakhe hain ham hi Sath RahteHamara glamour hai aur Yahi Hamari life hai for all offers bro in terms of where you want to reach your career if that is a ten on Ten point where are you right now like home I want to 3 on 10 I want to 5 and 10 I do not have any benchmark Laga how I feel like I I feel like I am at a v ok that's a lot more to Halfway through I'm Halfway through incense ki artist wala kam kar liya mujhe pata as an artist I can do ab Aage Bahut Kuch Kar Raha Hai like to make this Pie bigger100% sure you will bro I am going to ask you thoda Sadiq question now a lot of artists you know will associate something like smoking weed or drinking alcohol in order to create better art like a lot of people say that this is not just music artists that scene YouTube was a Russian writers se this Asin actual painters also save this so what do you see people like that and bro I feel like I Felix everybody isBody Works in a different way and react to different things in different ways write Kuchh Logon Ko Daru party Nahin Mere Bhai just a few people who can drink on for like 10 glasses the specs raybiztech chal raha hai Kuchh Hote do Kendriya kam kharab ho gaya so it it all depends on you how you look at it scientifically it's been proven a bit ki is a focus Bhar Jata Hai per scientifically is the a b prove a key focus aapka gayab ho jata hai ki aap concentrate nahin kar paate ho theek haitotally depends on how it's reacting in your body me personally me personally no matter what time does in I'll ever put it out for the people to see or Never inspire people ki Mathura se likhta hun yaar main To Aise karta hun ya mere social media per Ja Meri stories Mein you will never see that side of me the one side everyone drinking you will never see me the glass on social media and be like you know this is a boys night where is the bottle and popping champions in a club Kiya Mene bewakoofi Kariya 2014 15 MayKyunki tab kya khud ka nhi Hota tha log bulate the Bhar jata tha do teen baje vah maine this life is not for me theek hai isliye main Aage Kabhi Dal I Nahin chauki vah pressure like I said learn good size of an artist Ki galtiyan Sab Mein theek hai vaise Aap dekho Kiya Bandar Achcha kya kya kar raha hai yah Mat Dekho ki vah banne ke liye usne sath mein kya Kya kiya for example is not necessary for you to indulge in alcohol or need to be known as an artist or to become one so it is not a lessonki aap Unka Lifestyle Jiye Vaisa 8 nikaalne Ke Liye Mein Aise Bhi bahut Logon example De sakta hun jo bilkul indulge Nahin hote hain cheezon mein great artist right across Mansi both sides of it it is your choice with whatever is happening in the rap scene in India now what is your favourite and least favourite things from the rap scene in India keep in mind where is going the most favourite thing is the number of audience thatmeaning of you know the number of years designing us itne sare log interest and upcoming rappers men like I see 12 year olds now writing really good pizza what really good visa so that is something I like now what I am not liking is this hold this this hold you know that this is not a culture that but this holder seen that is happening and you know sometimes you cannot avoid it also I am I am heating it that I cannot avoided Kyunki Yahan per Kya Hota Haibologe to aap bhi bus aur bol Doge to famous to it's a very thin line is a thin Line or and the spirit of an MC because an MC is a battle Gai right analyses somebody who will write rhymes and gladly Achcha Agar Bewafa kah rahe ho raha hai Jyada Sab Kuchh ho raha hai it is sticking to the pen is cheez ka Hua Hai Magar yah sab Na Ho To bahut badhiya hai aur do I am also very big part of it Mein jaake Bhi Agar rokane ki koshish Karunga bolunga mat karo tomessage Jaenge Logon ki Raftar Dar Gaya aur vah means banenge isliye chup Rehte Apne self-esteem Ko Sambhal the way I am just letting whatever happened happened and not being a part of it by Like even though you've been apart of this is in the past I don't want to ask Raftaar did I want to ask Dylan Nair this what was deniers state of mind when the disc disease and all were going on like when you win I was shocked I was shocked because you knowkaise banaye simple tarike se batao jisse Pyar Kiya vah Sar pay Sawar ho gaye aur Dekhte Dekhte Hain unke gunegar Ho Gaye to mujhe pata nahin Chala Mujhe Mujhe Chain Nahin pata nahin Chala Ki Kya Hua Ab Kyon how did it start and then I got news that somebody because it was misunderstood something I said was really misunderstood but Agar misunderstanding hui thi to phone per baat kar sakte the per ab yah Baat Kahane ka bhi fayda nahin because what happened happened yes the guyfind me the one who love them got holding both zaroor zaroor hone ke bavjud bhi whenever I was dissing I never does this art or I never Hero try to domain him if I am saying I am se I only say good things about Izzat I kept asking for facts chauki Hota kya ki was Sara instance alava Saurabh masaledar ho gaya tha uske andar fact Nahin day and it became like thing where Kaun Kisko Kitna Chhota dikha Saktabattery is the vah pahunch gaya tha isliye after to I quit and I was like men with just not gonna go anywhere we just got that on each other someone has to stop so that was the step I too would you do anything differently now when you look back and there is no way to handle it I'll tell you why because agar koi live jakar aap ke bare mein Kuchh bol deta hai to aur aap uski Safai dene lag Jaate to Ek pura mahaul create Ho Gaya pura sorry line naya create Ho Gaya aapko usmein world Rahana padega aur agar aapgalat ho ya sahi ho Kuchh Bhi Ho people are going to be there with your aunty you can't help it why because there is information we Hamara dimag aur Hamari Aankhen Pata kis chij mein trained hai ki Ham Aankhon Dekhi per Vishwas karen to pahle kya hota tha pahle Kaha Suno Jane Kaise koi baat Suni ismein se Rumal bola jata tha apni Shakal dikha Te Hue koi baat Bhul Jata Hai To because I always try to understandyou don't realise what's happening behind it and then you choose sides and a or r letter on my analysis is ke upar Meri study aaya hai ki most of the people are not actually heating Each Other matlab jo Logon Ke likhate Hain Ki Raftar aisa hai yah unke page per Jaate John ko Gali Dete Hain yah jo bhi ho raha hai nobody is actually hitting the person they are defending their favourite artist samajh rahe ho mostly Hate Me Hota mostly log trolley dusre ko kar rahe hain unko Apne wala artist Bada dikhana haiI want their artist to win because if there are times when it's their victory so it becomes more personal you know like it if you ask for favours the more you ask for favours the more people become your own people because I'm collector ki yaar yah To Chali Meri vajah se Rahi Mujhe Kya karvata Hai Mujhse kya kya mangta hai yahan Pasand I am I am in to wrap in general and I feel ki in even the whatever happened it was a important aspect of rabbitstream in India like it became National leaves and you are the three things that what time do very nicely back then or is good destiny declared Palakkad Meri there was already a iPod the gully boy movie right and after that

42,India's TOP Corporate Coach Radhakrishnan Pillai On Ancient Indian Career Hacks |The Ranveer Show 28,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o46z_93fZtc&list=PLfNW_1ECVaThQynVe4QDlBM5S6Kzy8CeJ&index=43,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o46z_93fZtc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLD3ws3PgtIHysr7rk3FbOvnu-irQw,3 books on the topic of Chanakya who was Chanakya is considered one of the all-time greatest brains that this country has ever produced the knowledge very spread his teachings actually lived on yours after he passed away at the greatness of that man so magic all the knowledge of Chanakya being boil down to one book called the Chanakya Niti and animated all the knowledge of the one book being boil down to a basic podcast I thought this episode of the Runway show as this is your personal mentorship sessionfrom Dr Radhakrishnan Pillai and elevate your consciousness and elevate your mind an elevator thought process because I can get access to one of the Nation's best Minds both the form of Chanakya and Chanakya reincarnated according to me Dr Radhakrishnan Pillai enjoy the episode was another very valuethis year the smartest individual in history of India was this person called Chanakya and I said about the smartest man in India is this person called doctor Radhakrishnan Pillai who is also the modern day expert on Chanakya and many people consider you Chanakya Reborn also covers the title of a video with it together the title of this episode of the Ranveer show is again related to Chanakya is a top 5 learning from the Chanakyaso before we get into the actual learnings which will help people benefit your modern-day Hustlers benefit I want to ask you a brief history of Chanakya and the Chanakya Niti so first of all thanks a lot for Bring Me Back in the speculation enjoyed your show it so much that is so fulfilling for me when I am just in this particular Studio and I'm glad your speaking on the topic which is my life commitChanakya Chanakya Niti everybody knows about Chanakya so much we can learn from Chanakya like to talk about two basic things one is the story part of Chanakya II the strategy part of Chanakya Chanakya lived in 3rd Century BC I was the king maker of Chandragupta Maurya he defeated Alexander blah blah blah blah everything is quite known and there are so much content available on YouTube website as we can watch it butthe second part of it reaches his work being document Edward said the road to books on is called the Kautilya Arthashastra in the secondary school Chanakya Niti the difference between these two is Kautilya Arthashastra has got 6000 sutras of formulas of how to run a Kingdom Tower 600 mosaic Raj Vidya made for the leaders does it also better business if it does in fact I've gotten quite a few big son application of Arthashastra into the real life including business II a book is called Chanakya anything andbook which consisted of 350 or sutras 350 AWD vs 6000 that the difference scholar seat Arthashastra was written for the king's the classes while Chanakya Niti was written for the masses is very practical in nature It talks about how a person should leave his daily life in a what you should do it talks about Lord of aspects of human being right from being a good student to actually being a good householder you know how do you earn money ethicalit talks about also The Spiritual side of it also talks about parenting and very practical tips on how to be careful in life how to choose your friends how to actually make sure that you are giving money also donation to the right people never to get fooled extraction I'm coming back Chanakya it is definitely a book but if you look at the towards Chanakya and Niti I like to submit a person that cannot use a person of course but Niti by itself has got a lot of meaningNiti means policy Niti means the way to go Niti in strategy Niti means plan would meet in Sanskrit it cause various meanings outside Chanakya planning Chanakya way of teaching Chanakya strategies 100 Tak 17 X visible talking about the book call Chanakya Niti which was written by Chanakya many years ago and I've been fortunate that I am also written a version of Chanakya Niti in Radha Krishna Palace explanation of it also so what will a person gameI'm going through your book on the Chanakya Niti or just having information about life if they are at point A Before heading out at point B what will they become definitely will benefit it's like going to school and you started attending the first standard and after you got passed the second standard and you'll see the difference in you because Chanakya Niti helps you to think differently if you think differently you do the same things differently if we got better strategy of our Storedoing absolutely nothing is all about strategies policies so while learning Chanakya Niti lot of people for centuries of God benefit and I am sure you will send me your example one of my teachers is to tell me the end you know which is India's best selling book Chanakya Nitidifferent from the other sources 650 sutras of pharmacist in the same but what happened to that in Lord of the books that we have is that the Sanskrit and the translate into English on something very different we argue an explanation of a all them in detail for example and then we'll talk about how did not benefit you from point a to point B high scores of five points that you should take away from this particular video start by saying that it simple Sutra a strategy be careful from three thingsok and it continues by saying if you know how to use them it will be beneficial if you miss use them they will finish to the first one is fire free fire how to use Google how is fire rights were warm up the how is required for cooking that's why you know enter how is also called housewarming what if I don't know how to manage that it can one of your house so be careful from Fire Red can help you destroy yousculpting to close to everything that's good to know if you miss you is the king the destroyer the people you know who are around powerful people should be careful that there was a little you ok you are promoted and you can take charge of this Kingdom setting can make your King the thing is that it would take the king for granted they will finish of a career in a life once and for all so powerful that can destroy your main kyu Chadya says the third thing also snake be careful for mistake and dust and we can actuallytune what we are aware of it that actually in the army people are trained to catch snakes you what is the logic that China me you are not Jungle and especially when you are on Amit Shah and you are going to deep jungle you feel hungry right so they looked around and probably they will find a fruit or a flower to fruit Mein look good with exotic but you're not sure it's poisonous but you know your feeling hungry you need to surviveBekhudi lot of things around but the beautiful part that every particular Jungle will have a snake the snake and bite you as a danger so you'd be careful of learning but you know if you know how to catch the snake and maybe just not take the weather was part of the whole snake body you can actually eat actually become like a survival in the Jungle I am not hearing aid in a business nikitas with the logical is that be careful from a snake but it can also useful to youpositive patients practical from Fire King and snake now look at this you can actually practical applied so when you are in front of your boss is it ok and close to him to give me want but don't cross that line that Lakshman Rekha think about goes to fire accident accident so I am just give one example of 350 ideas about how you can be successful and careful in life in fact to be successful you should be careful in life andcoming to the five top learnings of the day so I think every 350 sutras call top by itself be limited to what is the formula is equal to MC squareparenting ok to lovely kids but just because the kids are good doesn't mean you are a good parent as I always look at all the very basic formulas sutras the Chanakya book about parenting for the first five years love the child next 10 years discipline him and after that consider them your friends formula sampann 3 liners so let me explain that you should a child is small is very lovelyJo you can only love the child suppose you gotta latest mobile landesbank did you can't do anything about it just love the chal Unconditionally at the moment the child is 5 years old and upward its Internet start developing it now and it's every dangerous today happening because the speaker of parents allow children to do anything that they won't let you that bad parenting what Chanakya is that now you need to actually use discipline and disciplined Asam in beating ok the ability to say no is also important for repairyes yes yes you will never understand what is no one that can actually to failures in life to discipline the child for the next 10 years and after that consider him or her as your friend the biggest problem that we have a special a country like India has the child may be 70 years old but the 19 year old parents still abhi Baccha Hai after 15 years you are fully grown of course life experiences may not be that big yet your full adult this formula for help me sofalove your child 5 years discipline 10 years and then cancel your friends and think full parenting at the best level for 15 years now coming back to the 5.30 talking about I like to summarise from the all the experiences that I have gone through by reading studying Chanakya the first Niti the first Chanakya Niti to have a successful life is to have a purpose in life of people in a live like a common personprobably the highly educated but you look at them every dal and they don't even have a reason to get up so they just pull themselves out and then that ok study now I need to get a job ok now got a job and get married to get my network children ok that's good but that's normal successful people do all these also but have something beyond the first question that if you want to really be success in life ask yourself what your purpose what is that for youwhich theory to live and if necessary die study using understand that I think there is a saying that the only purpose of a person's life is to have a purpose everything Falls into place setting friends Chanakya says what we call in modern-day setting kaun si goal setting exercise to do something with your Sab sit down and you know in our ancient old tradition it called finding your swadharma what are main born foris very deep question would you actually go introspect and spend time with yourself meditate will answer will come to you remember how I found my purpose in my life believe me I was a Kailash Mansarovar live in the Himalayas and when I saw the Kailash mountain first I will always telling you know what are the purpose of my life the moment I saw Kailash mountain it hit me at somebody speaking Jameen and saying that please give your life to the study of Chanakya and is Arthashastra I just told mysorry I don't know where it is found that is a feeling but I feel you know I should dedicate my life to the promotion and the studies of Chanakya Arthashastra she kept it very quietly to herself but whenever I have a problem she always remember your purpose in your life will ask me how are you so full of energy every 1015 books and reading Neet books on Chanakya got involved into movie is I will be reported as I am teaching in universities across the globeevery single day I'm atleast give me one or two lectures on interviews of something like that is mineral how do you keep it going and I have a purpose in my life I discovered it long ago a lot of people even the end of the life they don't have a purpose of this say I was dead at 28 and I got married 882 just leave and do somethingper people have to live a normal life you can actually when extraordinary life first and activities have a purpose Disco the purpose go inside that it added value was pulled out from a tree in that instance it comes very same this is for me it could be actually save a girl child for everybody to be different in that could be in sports was used for YouTube YouTube and just broadcasting it day in and day out what you have a purpose for which you will actually get a babyNIOS APJ Abdul Kalam suicide you know dreams or not that what you see when your sleeping but dreams are those that don't love you sleep formula number 1 Chanakya Niti even in like daily life in office see the like the best performers have been with the organisation for more than a year and a half to yours now our guys who wake up in the morning with the intention of ok today I'm just not created a and just going to add value is that it the perfect meyes yes yes it doesn't have to be even going to take over the world for its environment is must in Hindi little things but it you should put your mind on that one thing and it's all about advantages you don't have to 100 purposes in one cell you may have found that one Chanakyait in fact it is mathematically Pawan is called the Game Theory called a successful don't be stupid to change it is doing well people what they didn't already found the purpose is I am now let me go to the other ones and the other ones we will not be there in the first is also is like riding everywhere and finding no water is very important to rightly pointed out in every day to create a video and that purpose we will had kids who have worked in the organisation with the thing of no I wantaur Janu to slow or be happy to get created and underlined up exactly without any water in your exact so began as well as an organisation of the story is happening in front of you to kids you of groom your not made those mistakes people make on the effect that actually connect to my second point desire to learn the purpose12 may be start an NGO that will feed in Om hundreds of children but I am actually associated with an NGO contains a roti Bank Roti bank is a very interesting phenomenon where actually they are feeding the Street children and they actually do you know that a million children out of time but the thing is that it has a purpose that the first step I don't know how the process works on which cricketer is sports man on YouTube for that particular Madrid I said OKthe purpose but I can't jump into a dried Sunita we desire to learn formal or informal is what people do years ago and joiner course there are far more things so for example you can you find your purpose in life if you require a coach and gender Cricket Academy or a film academy of what we've read books in law in AC YouTube video setting this generation advantage of actually getting knowledge free but you should be a student visa no I am a beginner and even if you are an expert you still should have a desire to learn that top there is somethingshould have a purpose II a desire to learn and it can be multiple ways of learning digital formal informal you know to box to cinemas 2 people in the conversationnice and more creative and your desire to learn there is something more in different way of creating it exports 3rd point is also something connected and it's called having elders with you and the Sanskrit word for that is called British and yoga point is purpose Sadar Bazar to learn about whom do you learn from learn only from experts let us put life into three liveok select your level 5 that could be people water level 3 that could be people were at level 5 they could be people were level 10 everybody ok that's not a nice desire to learn from everyone but the reality is that lets your level 5 of knowledge and experience and that is somebody was at level 2 or 3 who comes to you actually you end up teaching that personhe or she says it's an input but that's not actually an expert advice if you are a level 5 another person also level for you are actually equal friends we can discuss with each other sharing this is no with the same as those people were at level 10 you have a 50 crore company you can I friends were also 50 crores that in a people was the start of Nivea 10 crores you actually lined up teaching the 100000000 Gaya how to be a 50 crore and discussing common problems with our friends at Ootybut with Sanyog is actually a society yourself with $100 then what happens is basically a surrounded with such people automatically raise your bid in to be without any of us so let's say in a week and spending at least 4 hours with people were more experience than we just friends and and don't even do it just watched them will be surprised when is already 800 250 crore lets asset turnover of a company has watched them listen to the discussions withknowledge we actually turn around a complete 26170 cross easy way of actually being successful by being around those people were more successful than you and when the say something that I actually guiding you try to break your barrier and go to the next level would the next Orbit this first is the purpose desire to learn and learning from experts and here is a warning many people actually get MStwo terms opinion and expert advice and opinions you think that's an otherwise it is not an advisor it is just an opinion it's a person who doesn't know anything who feels to mujhe bhi lagta hai The Lord of market research is get it wrong there is a common man Singh what you think the product will do well or not given data to the real inside is by those people who said this will work and you don't have to go to statistical data as well get how to create a successful businessJust Cause 1 Bill Gates right but 20 people was startups are also important to understand that expert advice is what is with the Sanyog are so if you are already doing YouTube would you like to learn from person was already maybe 10 times bigger than you ok so here is an advice which thread is a very powerful sweet little advice it says never take advice from somebody who is not an expertthis is our advice and advise only ticket from an expert their costly maybe to meet that particular person it will be delayed to the positive and meet Bill GatesKash do internet vs read books but 2020 finding information and finding mentorship from the people is not difficult yes genuine if you got the fourth one might actually Chanakya did its create Institutions understand usually what happens is that when people started always a one-man show R1 moments water was would you you you you go you reach a point that I can go higher with the team onSrinu and individual may be good but the next khilaf happens when you do everything in the process systems that's when you start building teams companies in situations involving the price of one person but you know it's like you're being a good actor and actually creating a production company that's the skill happens with production companies would last beyond you and select are you have a time limit to you are in a performance and this is a smart and ice water Chanakya TV credit Chandragupta Mauryacredit systems and processes for the future Chandragupta Maurya EP don't do that what will happen exactly that you will die with you is very important to create instance Kingdom along with the king who different things one is creating a king is also creating a Kingdom now become v and A final point and that is very important probably we should practice it more often it is called documentation documentation in various forms that could be returned it could be audio or videothat we had a habit which problem is not too much that in today's generation is called diary writing everyday what you learnt write it down Silver Surfer will do it every day it's in your actually located diary 365 days your return something is it was how to things about successful people when they write it themselves they remember after they are gone to thanks Chanakya Road all strategies even if your not return they would have been a great person nobody knowshis mind in fact If you look at all the great Gurus and we are talking about the book autobiography of a yogi written by him is not their performance and Andaaz book is documented all religions of the world and documented you know this year we're actually celebrating 558 your of Guru Guru Nanak Ji is birthday Guru Nanak these birthday how many forever that if you go to any Gurudwara they actually worship and image admin what is thethis it's the Gurbani Facebook rate this book and actually the nodes that energy

now onwards aveeno physical Guru the book will be the group had not returned Arthashastra Chanakya Niti Bada loss is very important that your place please write a bookhow to write a book on being India's number one youtuber definitely sale looking at this point you start realising that life is about actually creating a Legacy after you are gone do you want to be successful only for a short time you will be successful forward to that extent that generations to come will actually remember you are the five things purpose desire to learn learn from experts building and Institution and find V pointdocument in the processes others can benefit after your lunch this is beautiful but I have one burning question in my mind I have to get out it is that because you study chanakyan so much detail what do you think that I was thinking about on his deathbed this is a question lot of people ask me into the extremely how did the naked Eye Care that as well let me tell you on Chanakya had something called as ichcha Maranexactly is problem very successful in life and I think for me is an ideal because he never had any regrets that together people who read number one is that people who don't know what to do in the life on never did anything in the life and I am just lying on my bed and it is just driving around like anybody of the did not do anything that the first ever regret not doing anything contribute anything II is those people who had a Desire but never got it fulfilled in a lifetimewanted something but not completed Chanakya actually was different was completed both of them had no regrets number 1 opposite in his life that was to create a whole empire of the bharatvarsh he created that what is important that he did it in his lifetime before dying not many people are lucky people have goals and they say you know I will show a seed and maybe my grandchildren enjoyed afcoset grandchildren should enjoyed provided you in your lifetime what was Chanakya thinkduring his deathbed probably seen that thank you for everything now I believe very successfully and peacefully if found that made you can have no regrets I live my life well and that scholar successful life

43,"OYO's Founder Ritesh Agarwal On Future Of Startups, Inspirations & Covid-19 | The Ranveer Show 49",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ETWj9jrsdQ&list=PLfNW_1ECVaThQynVe4QDlBM5S6Kzy8CeJ&index=44,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ETWj9jrsdQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDDah2ygnbq2qGb8gEf9RdRYmtoHw,about caring about the outcome I think that's the most important perspective among all the many things that can be done it is perfect for me everyday the only thing that I am most focused on is to make sure that I feel happy about the job that I am doing I try to make a positive difference and most importantly that positive difference would make an impact in people's lives the most important is to remain calm because inJab sabji the bahut Acchi chal rahi hai even then making his decisions is back and on the other hand when things are there in their troubles it's important to also remain calm because his creates raised its critical to to enable that so that's what has been my first focus to become when the fisherman can't go fishing to the sea they repair the legsthis is the time to repair it to make sure that if our customers are not getting a good experience in some forms improve it be the best for the customer when the world comes back no matter how many times I am postback or no no matter how many times are fall down I will stand up and go harder at the same as Pareshan than ever before I won't give up that's the one thing that that I believe is an important skill set forsaying will be hundred people who want to put you down and the many reasons for it but to the extent your heart is a good place you had write values and your right intent I think you can get back at it and and and get back to fighting and I think that's that's the one thing that I am focus upon ok how is it going house Quoranew Europe this is of course something that you see once in a lifetime so trying to deal with it at this point of time this is this is probably one of those times where the longest I have remained home for weeks and weeks so trying to trying to see through this period but but one of the positive effects has been approved my hair longer after after waleyou know you know the pain of the brother you know the pain of the gravel mental Space 2 because honestly entrepreneurship is one of those things whatever stage II at it one of those things that does definitely for lack of a better word Sath the life of you somewhere to stay within the right only I would I would always tell everyone about that you have to take that break every three days I just recharge so that your creativity is recharge so thatmission is recharge what your mental space like right now are you recharge your look you are in this period there is no choice but to be recharged look is a really tough times for zero startup entrepreneurs out there especially the ones who are in the stage of building of the companies to begin with this is the time to also be responsible and take responsibility take charge I think a for me at this point of timethe principal is Jaan Hai To Jahan Hai which is what I see a lot in regular discussions and Jaan Hai To Jahan name of customers because Hamari customers they stuck in other cities States countries and they all want a safe place hotel owners are fighting out on the front lines by serving frontliners hospital so making sure that they are safe making sure that employs even though this is a tough times and we have to make somedecisions of follows how do we make sure that they keep getting enough amount of income to see through the life they have Medicare benefits so trying to focus on monitoring the situation and ensuring that there is a Jaan Hai To Jahan Mein for everybody around us and being responsible in in every way possible when you was starting out your journey did you think that things would grow out this was not a good covid-19 we talk about that but I'm talking about your life are you did you ever think thatsingle go so well you like 2627 think you be doing at 27 and what are you doing nowExpectations that I did anyone knows that the one thing I tell everybody saying that you really want to do something without caring about the outcome I think that's the most important prospective among all the many things that can be done at this point of time so my singular focus for the last six to seven years has been that when I started this business I saw that 700 tractor at the right price at the right location was impossibleand my aspiration was how do I ensure that we get good quality of spaces for consumers and the last five to six years we got so much love from zero consumer partners and flow is just the people of this country and see messages as ago I think just a number of people that have given us laugh I always say before 9493 sort of time period the only good choice was to work inall to potentially go somewhere in the national in the US or Europe to potentially consider opportunities in this generation for the first time that is somebody who's your has a dream and wants to make a difference people are willing to give the opportunities people are willing to let them make mistakes and let them create a great impact in the years to come so so no I had no Expectations but I am truly very thankful and grateful for the opportunitymodern sofa beautiful do you mean I'm pretty sure aware of the fact that you are the poster boy for you are a big aspect of waves branding in general so I am not talking about Ritesh beyond per not understand what Ritesh the guy the man you feel this level of pressure one for being the face and two for being the face of inspiration for the whole generation because a lot of young kids want to take a moment of inertia study you a study of mistake the studyyou done correctly so what does that feel like that night when you're going to sleep you feel any amount of pressure you feel any amount of I don't know men like any kind of negative emotion I don't think of any different from what I was at a party in South Ex Delhi andtrying to get the first Hotel started I don't feel any different than that is Samay bhi koshish Kare the to try and make a big difference as we put sister and I think that I will keep trying that for all the years to comepersonal civics for studying of the business of love is a President if you have to think about it it's not like only sometimes also gotten flat and a criticism but I have used as criticism always with the positive perspective to learn if you get a Hundred things to laugh if you don't get back then maybe that love is not worth it call of thosecriticisms and constructive uses koshish karta I try to do better every day and and and and focused in in the direction what are you working towards what you are in goal in life at 50 words for me everyday the only thing that I am most is to make sure that I feel happy about the job that I am doing I try to make a positive difference and most importantlythat positive difference would make an impact on people's lives and seeing a group of various messages in the comments like that of people saying I use for XI use your for wife and summary saying that I don't like their foreheads anything because people to this few years been able to make an impact to millions of people across the world last year alone 41 million Logon Neused across the world for me that's the one thing that matters the most beyond beyond anything else so at 15 if I am happy about the job I am doing I will I will keep doing this I have no for I have no aspirations to make a Tu to change so we have to kind of address the elephant in the room you a lot of people are wondering about the covid-19 situation and how it affected oyo I know that you guys can of spotted itwave actually took over the whole world to khud you dislike the runners through what happened in your head when you realise Ocean this is happening and at the same time of BSc hospitality industry would get affected in a big way so as the guy who started out this whole journey what was going on in your head and normal people I feel a normal human Aam aadami water problem panic I do believe entrepreneurship kind of grains of brain and having a higher level of mental fitness so keeping that has an aspect likewhat went on your head when the whole situation was going on 1st of nobody in the world that something like this country is something that that the situation isI didn't know I don't think anybody else new about this time we saw this for the first time in China very sorry that there was a massive impact and the whole like a lot of problems is shutdown and so and initially we actually felt that this was going to be a China only effect and all the rest of the business is waiting ok but when soon in a month or two around earlyMarch we saw that there was a massive impact happening in every part of the world where a group of this was affecting the individuals in human beings on a daily basis for the travel and Hospitality link company we will literally in the middle of the prices were not given the corners of the prices because with issues like the ones that today I think maybe the same city in the same state customfor the people were travelling from one City to another people are not going to be excited about getting on a plane when you know that there is such large amount of infections that are they going on us even before the law of the a lot of Indian airports at what like half empty so our immediate response response was making sure to reduce any expenses that we can reduce super example be reduced 8 Travels of employees including myself to reduce marketingblue picture st and security we shared that what ever can be done to be insured ensuring great safety and security for a partnership with hundreds of thousands of masks to our hotel's sanitization liquids consumer safety systems and so on and that unfortunately very recently we had to also grow have some of our employees on Windows but when that happens we try to ensure that we can bring back and committedcan bring back as many of our team members as possible but beyond that every team member gets 100% Healthcare Medicare the school children fees and a lot of other things to ensure that employees can see through this tough times none of us can relate with out of the situation is going to be but for us it's important to lead by example so I am Allah Ki leaders have always taken 100% of 50% bakersXX x** the first was what had before anybody else are but from a leadership perspective what were your big in earnings of this place again on a personal level I'm not talking about the business side of things on a personal level what are you figure that there is so much that it is very easy to be popped up everydaySOS message think this is a problem that same problem and so on the most important is to remain calm because in Great days Jab sabji the bahut acchi jewellery and even then making his decisions is bad and on the other hand when things are there in their troubles it's important to also remain calm because his creates waste it's critical to to enable that so that's what has been my first focus to become secondit because it's very easy to get 40 Euro value at home and your seen so many of negative news for your team members owners and your customers it's important that for all of them there is some way of engagement to be tried every way of making sure that we can find ways of engagement with not the cell employs a lot party members with parents with families with children described to engage with them as wellupload is in 20 times not only to people come together people have a sense of serving the society so a lot of employees across India and across the world came together to also serve the society for example we recently contributed to various fast and a lot of people think that contribute to the file is actually not for office employees who put together contributionswe as a group together would want to serve India and various other countries across the world to take this opportunity for people to come together and fight against against this cause and and as a prime minister safe in it together that that's all of the last in the developed is this is also a great time to reflect because in the last two years things were going so quickly for companyreflect and see what we do right and what we're doing work but want to be a lot to write and hear from all other stakeholders and at the end prepare for the future that is a given the world opens up consumers will want touch rechecking consumers will want to sanitize and Europe clean experiences how do you prepare for all of those as as the world turns back a beautiful bro I will allow people look at you as a good blueprint for housegrow a business especially in this country are completely self made by you know lots of I feel like a someone who is a constant loan as well which is kind of it goes hand-in-hand being an entrepreneur and only because your concern are my asking you this you mentioned that in this page you understood what you did right and wrong so could you take us through like the top three right things super fast and the top three wrong thing superfast in your whole journey till now10 question 3 things that I believe it wrong and start with the role and then go to the right of the three things that I could have done better is what I could have focused that in bringing good quality talent sooner it took me one and a half or two years to be able to make sure that I start bringing high quality talent in the business II was insuranceas our company grew we should have taken up or sooner and said what are the two or three things we can improve we did that at the end of last year around December of January we could have done it a few months before and the third one what I believe we could have done better is make sure that as a true worldwide we could have set clarified about what are thefocus areas of our business across various parts of the world and ensured that not just the what but the why is also communicate better now come come to the part of what we did right before I begin that because he talked about Entrepreneurship and Laura started getting built I believe this is the best time for people to build new coming there is no better time than a crisis for companiesI have read various news about people sing Don't start now there's a lot of race and so on and so forth but it's critical to know that crisis ke Samay Mein sabse badhiya company 23 learning number 19 Vati is good for a lot of times where you be told that he could be very smart you gotta learn about everything in the business if I knew how hard buildingaverage property never done number 2 is making sure to go after Industries that everybody is changing now it is I see that people see the Dead 2 or 3 industries are exciting and everybody wants to go in that remember the Industry that Nobody's looking at this point of time is the Industry that going to be very successful but not just a successful you can be the leader of the industry in the world comes backlearning has been the big fish in the small pond not the small fish in the Big Boss and third and and probably one of the things that I believe is is is going to help Oreo survive this crisis is a great group of leaders I work with in the history of a company I have not lost the people who work with me the the the senior leaders who have gotten and all the team membersconstantly get inspired by other they have not left and will continue to Stand Together in his very tough times so I believe that that's the third thing that is give respect to your colleague who you work with and if you let them do what they want to do was smart enough to know that the jobs I think they will they will work a path to make sure the long-term economic uses amazing stuff bro what has the lockdown talking about yourself you knowpoem side and Ritesh thought you were yourself lots of things I think the first thing I have learnt is video calls can really postpone lunches and dinners because if you at office you could always take that 10 minut break for a larger quantity from back to back video calls it's the second thing is no matter how muchyou think that deliveries and 16 working and a how many things to me you can live with very little basic things around yourself minimalism is a good thing and it can work in outside the third thing is I used to feel the only way I can get my job done is making sure that I am in front of my team members in front of my customers and so on I still feel so but now it is a fuel thatthat's that that's not the only way to do things may be 727 the things can be done by means of video session is a few learning have had beyond I think now is a lot of mosquitoes so so I have those I don't know if others are saying that but it is amazing how much pain it is generally there are a lot of walking home that their masses spider fell on my backSpider-Man going back to the stone age slowly this like 10 of Bloom again so the next feet again there's a lot of young was watching this people who actually want to get into the owner was going for 16 year old 17 year olds and a field as always one of two things that three things that stays one of three things either you chase money like you wantlife and the bunch of people out there like that a lot of people you'll achieve that money and then stop they don't care much about other stuff the second is Legacy so say someone like a Steve Jobs Europe needs money but then wanted to be remembered after he died on the third thing people she is Impact to your clearly not in that first category you are a mix of the two other categories I feel but in saying that I'm definitely ask you more about to other categories my questions about the first category liveafter you made it big what do you spend on lavishly live for yourself and how do you do you pamper yourself in any way it is it that minimalism Minds at through and through I think is related withexample of group back in the day of I didn't watch that match live watch that litre Sachin Tendulkar playing in Sharjah in the middle of a crisis for it in the India Pakistan match those kind of tough times unless your fighting for impact there is no way you're going to be able to find the science USA that Hero why should I fight so hard refuses to leave this thingbecause what Challenger wife fight and speak so I believe that Jesus money is not the right thing for the long term but finally if you don't change my the money comes to you think is about impact and and and Legacy know about it I have a lot to prove and honestly I think we haven't made itthat said I think it is very critical because that way Sunday you can have that incomes and Yuva make a lot of losses but you can go back home thinking consistency of impact to her that you are able to make such a big difference and that will motivate you everyday it's it's it's hard to relate with it and look when I started the company I used to think is well listening to other entrepreneurslook this impacting doesn't make sense but old time I think you realise this very quickly in those days when you realise that running that one hotel in includes 20 things that could go wrong and you still want to do it and you ask yourself why I want to do it then you realise the only thing that you care about is making sure that you can make an impact if you're sad when you see that a one-story when you are not able to make the impactyou work hard that inspired you in a positive way to say that next time on you don't want that to happen again and and you want to make a amazing beautiful stuff again spoke about Sachin Sharjah to somewhere that the still a little kid inside you who draws inspiration from the people of grown up watching keeping that thought in mind I want to ask you to people from the world of Business and two people outside the world of business that you draw motivation from giving3 of 4 people outside the world of Business and two business ideas about the show is because the great business but at the same time people will remember him for ages after him because it did so good for the would be ready created Malaria by means of a virusright now in the field of covid-19 of factories even before the vaccines are found saying that once the waxing the sound the production will be harder that is this incredible for somebody to do an end and a lot of people think that I say that because I believe he's been able to make a lot of income but I believe it's more because he has been able to do such a good job for the world after building a good business as welll l along with the fantastic leader in Satya who's who is the CEO of Microsoft in creating a massive impact partly he is a fellow Indian Who done so well across the world the person I find who is very interesting that you are in India is actually today Kota some people might have known that Kotak was a bank which is earlier called Kotak Mahindra Bank and eventually becamethe first generation entrepreneur started his business and then built into being one of the leading banks in India did not inherit anything I think that's the second busiest person having part by India and list the set of values which which is a which is very inspirational outside the business world quite a few of them give two examples I think one of them I mentioned about 80from the area of a sports is Sachin Tendulkar think is a plastic is made such a big impacts in in in the area of sports he's been no nonsense he started his life back he got criticism of his life saying you doing it for your own self why are you trying to do this and so on but nobody can ignore that he is a classic a match winner somebody who took in there and inphoto a level that nobody else can relate with so I get inspired by him the other person am very inspired by think someone who are a lot of people are inspired by Izzat Indian Prime Minister I think the way he grew from being zero from from being from this little town in Gujarat to being the most influential and impactful person in the world I think you is incorrectand for me personally and my family is be become an inspiration vixens the day my parents thought that I was doing something wrong and he came on live television and said in startup India event that Ritesh Ko Dekhkar Mujhe yah Lagta Hai Ki Chai wale Ne Hotel chain ka vichar Kyon nahin kiya my parents but I must be doing something right to be to be doing this job one generation back if you start a companypeople set a numeric field in school or se aapko Calcutta we have a leader of the country will it to inspire young entrepreneurs by saying that grow if you are able to start a company and give job we will 5 people you've done a good job so I think dose dose dose of the two inspirations and and they are those are the personal stories that inspired me about it one of the amazing stuff bro coming back to the slightly business ideaswhat's your viewpoint on business opportunities after the covid-19 situation is done and you know if someone were to take away oyo rooms from you completely and you still have the same mindset the starting from the ground up what Industries would you look and say ok that something akin to that something you should do that something no people should do should build things in what would be those Industries viewvery very interesting let me share some examples of the people will go back to stores or shop social distancing will be ki so how do you use cameras which are able to predict what basic social distancing should remain there is a technology opportunities that how do you play ability for people the generally houses a small houses in India especially people 11 paying usHero all very kind of accommodation which are small location I think that it is critical that people are able to create experiences with people can work from home anything that's linked list C anything that's linked to give me anything that link to education over internet group of those opportunities will will dramatically so consensusesUse technology for will rapidly increase me if somebody when to take me away from me given a chance I will build more again because I just believe that that a people humans are social beings they will travel no matter what can and I hope to make sure that when they travel the get good quality spaces at lowest prices in the years to come sosame thing but I would recommend others to consider every opportunity including hotels and travel because nobody is looking at travel if you consider travel and confident that long-term your business should also be successful so you are not so is the guy at the Kinara store ok now if in your shop peoples are your use and losing your customers because of the whole covid-19 situation how does that on the pen aur how does the shopkeepers maihappening right now with the hospitality industry in general so when there is no one actually that coming to touch your product what does an entrepreneur do because you spend all your life and energy building of the beautiful consumer experience and others know until I use it so what are you doing that what are the team members at oyo doing right now what what your ground staff doinginteresting messages I recently saw from Rajasthani runs in a ship was that when the fisherman can't go a fishing to the sea De repair the next so this is the time to repair net to make sure that if our customers are not getting a good experience in some forms improve it be the best for the customer with the world comes back if wesome places in technology that we can make improvements let's do let's pics that be the best technology company we can be and anything else around towards the shorter try and serve people in every manner possible so over 30 hospitals in India vs serving the front lines over 20 embassies across the world the foreigners and people were stranded in India with getting them good places to livewhatever basic places we can enable people basic reasons people can come and stay with us we will try to serve them but the primary focus is to repair the next so that when the sea is the and we go fishing we are the best fishing boat on the sea I love and answer ok I have to last personal questions we are one is that something a lot of people like to ask in the comment section which is your whole experiencegames of the thiel fellowship and I don't just a case over it because a lot of people who don't know about it is explain it very briefly the young ke do is like watching someone who might also apply and what how did that helped you in life so introduces to it and take us through experience take us through the outcome and what you learn from that face so the solution is done by featured here who is the founder of a people and and process of building a great management teams who is the Venturi calledPaypal Mafia who were all built billion-dollar + companies and and Percy was the first investor in Facebook I got to know about a year from a very interesting perspective I saw it is also the first time in the movie The Social Network when I was still in my senior high school I saw him on the moving effect how amazing would it be if I ever get the officeI start searching about him and then I find the theoretical site and I apply before we there was no other Asian resident who had become a theoretical issues in the US become fearlessand so on getting excited to meet those people in my heart had no expectation of grief Singh four days later here is your flight ticket to come to the US and out of the 40 people 20 people would get selected to become a tearful so thankful to have the opportunity if light and Shadow quotes when the USI was among the first international flight I could get on the first time I use of passport between side did not even go to Nepal before that but it was an incredible experience that I became one of the earliest yourselves incredible experience because for the first time I got exposed to search incredibly smart people across the world in fact this morning I found that are one of the Other close the startcompany code figma design 20 50 million dollar round at 2 billion dollars at at at a time right now in SBI CDM to increase quality of people and I was thankful to be a part of those group of people I think over a period of time I focus has been how do I constantly create an impact which is equal to the kind of impact the theory was unable to createit helps me from the perspective of exposure It helped me to learn from incredible business people and other players in the secondary and It helped me to get introduced to some incredible people in the sector of business that said when I came back to India to Gosai the second voter reality hit me again when you realise the second hotel owner doesn't care whether your fellowweather Silicon Valley entrepreneurs no you only cares about Mujhe Chokha munafa Kitna Hoga so I think you can learn from the fellowship at the end when you build your business you have to have the reality check that you have to start from Ground Zero all over again but incredible learning experience and a highly insists upon folks to consider applying to get your services if if if you and if you want to make a big differencepicked up again actually I have one last question to the mind Nagar Market to very interesting question in the comment section which is that One Two Three movie that had an incredible amount of impact on your mind set like the guy you are today what was three movies that have some I played a role in shaping up quite a few but let me go one after the other I think the oneone classic movie that I can imagine it would have moved entrepreneurs across the world would be it's called the the parents of the Silicon Valley or something like that so that that's one is a documentary very interesting documentary which talks about How How How How Silicon Valley and puts Apple God createdwhich is very interesting is the men who built America it's not movie is a series of documentary on the History channel it tells crisis look Kaise nikalta a lot of people don't know what to think about it that way that sometime like a many years back us was a civil wars 7 country and a poor Nation and your pores number 1us have it possible got7 and it had blue resources but fantastic entrepreneurs like that of vanderbilt Andrew Carnegie JP Morgan Henry Ford they set up a new business of new businesses and change US into becoming a world leader in the most other countries big challenges entrepreneur stick the Lipeople typically the five and the lead the world going for it and I think that the second story anything the third is very interesting that is are a very Indian movie Guru that that a lot of people would have seen and and products of you just tell how grow a young business person becomes zero successful over over a period of timesing to all the problems that that it is a beautiful as a lot about you 11 books like if you had to go back to a 17 year old Ritesh hu starting out oyo what were three books you put his hand in the airis zero to one I saw those in comments like every file format 021 showed up goes without saying that make it because I asked to talk about third one is a stool is is this book which is the biography of Elon Musk I think would an incredible biography today's have once that problem three times the woodenthe last one I think I am I grew up in a decent something to talk about to reset a book for the story of madhubabu was your Madhusudan Das was one of the first started from and extremely well back in the days I think I learnt quite a bit from that amazing and if you were to write a book what would your homecore message of the book b-11 message that you want to put out and show you put in all your learnings and your character building tips but that 1 crore message what would it be like that there is always light at the end of the can you are the one thing about me that IVada Pav I like to eat at the at the risk of looking for somebody who's a02 proud is no matter how many times I am forced back or no no matter how many times a fall down I will stand up and go harder at the same aspiration than ever before I won't give up that's the one thing that that I believe is an important skill set for entrepreneur200 people will want to put you down and the many reasons for it but to the extent your heart is a good place you have right values and your right intent I think you can get back at it and and and get back to fighting and I think that's the one thing that I am focus upon amazing stuff man Aam I am gonna ask you a slightly controversial question and that only because I feel like the world of social media alwaysI have the same question running through a lot of social media influencers in mind we often asked how do you deal with online hate how do you deal with online trolling now in the life of an entrepreneur especially not know who the mainstream brand like you have to deal with both online and offline store in your real life also have to deal with that to a degree again I'm not asking the founder of asking Ritesh as a peripheral what do you do in your own hairoverhead process that kind of input of negative data because honestly happens at every stage of human life School you have like believe you have people who problem coming from negative family background only know how to ask you hate so that the world does have 10 20% of those people so what is your big learning from dealing with that kind of situationwhen for the first time I saw both online and mainstream negativity towards myself and I think that taught me a lesson back in the day that is if you can if you're willing to work hard 10 20 30 40 years later if you are able to make a positive difference people are willing to give you the20 to 30 years people will keep pushing back on you out like this documentaries on Netflix bestremember that people ignore that for 100 positive love that comes and I am very thankful for that and number 3 is that among the heat is noise but 20% is feedback so a lot of people just switch off heat I actually objectively read all the head that comes and goes away koshish karthings to write into better I will take that into a better job so that in 3 years LLB new hit and that you hit a can do a better job for the next three years do you have any kind of load is at or every young entrepreneur does I don't know you count yourself as a young entrepreneur anymore in knowing the kind of humble guy you I am sure you say I still am younger long way to go and understand that that that is the correct that the coal mines at every entrepreneur should have buteven now when you are your experience as a businessman do you still have days where you are look like I don't want I know that's not a part of your character I mean say things like self-doubt things like to hear things like second guessing things like regret do those emotions refund your headis a great if you can motivate people digitally and I think you are your great inspiration and that's why I think a lot of people should consider motivating people digitally or sharing their personal stories with people as an opportunity that that's the going to be a big opportunity going forward in life that is an entrepreneur job or a liferoller coaster in 5 minutes you can go from seeing great things like a great message saying Gosht we just want this great deal and it can make a big difference but 5 minutes later you will hear from one customer in Mexico saying I don't have a good experience and you have a very low time seeing many kya Galti Kari the city that customer did not have would not have had a bad experience that roller coaster is everyday toself doubt questioning challenges while it is a field but I try to be calm and consistent as much as I can but but but but as you know that there are all these emotions that that come along I think being around people who genuinely have a sense of trying to make a positive difference formyself and my company around who are honest to be who don't have to say just good things they can challenge with the question we can be very hard to be really helped me quite a bit to make sure that I can keep keep a self-consistent amazing stuff so here's what I think of when is the first time I am talking to you Europe in person I do believe that you definitely have a very strong for your mindset somewhere inside your heart and why you're the kind of person will fight it outbut not violently not aggressively your kind of a detached wario something like a Sachin actually Had Se had that fighter mentality but from a very kind of withdrawn kam perspective so my question to you is not about the warrior perfect because I am sure that's all the books you read the movies you see in the courts you've read I am asking you were the other side of the kam stuff where does that come from to meditate do you have like spirituality in your life is it your upbringing in Odisha is it your family valueshow you being so come through this not everyone is grown not not every on your position with everyone agreed to come out on a public platform in the middle of a situation that affecting your industry so heavily and you are still holding a smile on your face have a normal brotherly conversation was that kam coming from because it's coming from some deeper place than just of books and moviespeople have lean on me a lie to yourself said there is trust from entrepreneurs who say that Ritesh we want you to make a difference is trust from customers that 40000 plus people were getting a visit who were getting business from last year the final three billion dollars to the country comes my family and relatives my neighbours so many peopleyou have to trust in me that I feel that I can't make that trust happen on the impact happens if I am not come with second is the values come from your April that grew up in this little town with very limited aspirations of people right so for example if somebody got a job inIT company pure Shahar Mein laddu bante the event to a good college the whole the whole town will know about the amount of aspirations and the values the simplest and the problems you see yourself a dramatic like the town income of come from over 70% people have up from below poverty lineI am fine for my parents actually had a small shop so we were actually doing relatively better than most other people in the result out but the problems that you see in real life are so much smaller than the problems that you have to deal with an entrepreneur so so I think the rock the the upbringing from Odisha and as well a combination of the trust and believe so many peopletell me I take that very very serious amazing amazing stuff so I actually have never be a thousand more questions to ask you correctly on the most solid my insides of come across but in saying that I know what it's like as a wonderful not dealing with your own task for the day that's why we will call it a day when it comes to this live stream I do want to do a full blown podcast with you because a lot of people are requesting that on this live streamself where you want to see us in the same room you on the YouTube channel on the Ranveer show so I am looking for that day but my final question asked in this live stream is at this stage of your life in the middle of the whole covid-19 situation but also generally speaking not specific to the situation was the best and worst aspect of your life right now I think the best aspectI am trying to think about it on the go but I think the first aspect in life is having the opportunity to be able to make a big difference once the world comes back and being able to plant root I feel a very thankful that I had the opportunity but on the other hand the worst aspect is not knowing what going to happen next I don't know how many cases are going to happen which countries will respond in the wayLN so on and so forth so that that seem to be a challenge to the prospectus Ranbir I think your story is incredible next time we do a podcast I'd like to have the opportunity to ask you a few questions as well as always love to man I hope I can also talk about how the world after covid looks like what was fighting the covid-19 book Li Hai and each member of our company was fighting forstories to tell at that point of time thank you so much for having me on your show in in the spirit of times I am and I am very thankful to you and all your us-22 to be so patient with me beautiful beautiful of God bless you man just keep being that detached wario that you are an inspiration to all on the panel of all ages in India and I mean that like everything ignore ignore what you know the haters are saying ManuI think the se but just from one broker to another just keep going keep going because your story is teaching people or lot and whether it's the hate you get the mistakes you make all the right things you do all the correct mind that you have your learning from you everyday so just keep going man thank you thank you God bless you bro have funbut just from one broker to another just keep going and going because your story is teaching people or lot and whether it's the hate you get the mistakes you make all the right things you do all the correct mind that you have your learning from you everyday so just keep going man thank you thank you God bless you bro have fun

want to know that 6018 1 6 1 described as an end and that's a problem with most most people never understand hero and their time do not read more than what is repository in the same stock market is a Rollercoaster and if you keep getting excited every time is up and downhamburger company wanna make you get distracted storytelling finance and deep entrepreneurship base podcast I got nothing from zerodha welcome to the Ranveer show brotherwhat is the secret to creating a Mammoth but bootstrapped organisation and I just wanna give the viewer some contacts is a lot of people don't understand what the term bootstrap means suggest two ways to make money for your company want to start one is that you Raise money to investors and the other is that you create a product to play a basic profit and loss game you are accumulated profit and protecting the business and that's how you grow it are coming back to the question thatthat your identity what is the biggest secret to playing this bootstrap game is not easy to remember thatthis country is Karan stuffed into this success equal to raising VC money which which isn't really true that successful businesses make money on which is the thing is because we didn't raise some money when we start the bases were forced to go and find ways to be profitable and I want to start making some money without water point praising easy money does in there is a lot of Independence that comes alongmy pictures remaining bootstrapped and not having a season today as a business owner of your preferred over this mama I keep telling this to sound like an elephant that runs like a cheetah right and then the reason for the nimbleness is not having all these professional investors who have to go and ask questions before your decisions are taken that I could be having this conversation with you take an idea from you and your Monday morning and executed and andnimbleness has been the success of the business and and that's why bootstrapped when you started off no one was really interested in giving my and then when we start making money than its own appointed to India and the other angle that most people understand is in IndiaUBC to invest in take money explain why so if you make a profit company 25% Axis then you have to pay a dividend distribution tax for 20% write any now from last year onwards in the hands of the promoter you still have to pay tax on the distributed as again it's your ssst paint 55% taxes before you take profit of the company that now compare this to say I am the VC right and se nausea VC investment andI sell some of my stick to the PC and I take money you feel long term and short term capital gains which is between 15 to 20% of the tax incentive in India is structured for promoted to sell stake in make money than to make profits and make money and that the reasons I think a lot of this company is now promoters locate even making money by selling the state versus trying to make profitable companies and dividendI keep bringing this up saying that innovation baby incentivizes right people will always look at the easier way to take make money which is selling steaks and selling stake means to raise money growth company then try to make it bigger get more investors in software for show in others bubble times where it's easy to install some how create a company which seems to have a lot of radiation and in the worldthis place out what's the story what is the actual story what do you doing when you are 17 what are you doing when you were 22 what were you thinking 11 or 12 years ago when you were just figuring that this is what you want to do what is going on in your head of those stages of life 16 17 and I used to live in this area dominated by MarwadiRoman boy so I am like there is only businessman in our extended familyfutures and options contribute to almost 90% of the exchange turnover what is the product where traders to explain that could you explain futures and options in the some people think that after a while you wait for one month to month 3 months now what people to understand is that turnover is just 1% of exchange turnover that peopletalk with for the stock price of pressure in shelf life the rest of the turnover is actually in the market is very speculated that there is a lot of this intraday trading that happens which is no you buy and sell shares within a day by the morning in the new self in some time that is 10% of the remaining 90% comes from this product code is futures and options that and a what features and options is the simplest form of futures issale agreement and I am a real estate agent I come to you and ask you can I have this property for 50 lakh rupees I will pay you 1 Lakh rupee premium keep this agreement with me and my job is to select water price that agreement between you and me 50 lakh rupees and that give us a premium for signing the agreement I don't find a buyer for it you get to keep the 100000 rupees that difficultMS Word write a call option so you can do exactly the same thing in stock market with with torch at an options is that you can make money both on the way up and other beta I mean if you see the big short the movie that suggest that makes a lot of money in 2008 when the market crashes right now how do you make money if you don't get into the market is why stock wait for it to go of it as you canthe way to make money on market Godown is using futures and options that it's it's quite complex to explain it too much but it is it ismake money fast you lose money would lose it faster right now what leverage means is that with your 100000 rupees you are not buying one lakh rupees stocks actually buying 500000 rupees is stopped which means of stop goes up 10% you are not making 10% reservation meeting 50% of the capital the other problem is enough it goes Ham 10% you are losing 50% of its it's everything X doesn't futures and options comes withthe exciting people which is no you can make money fast and furious 2001 I started reading the markets in futures and options and and the whole average was very very using tempting what do you think of when I grow up my account and I had borrowed money and try to make a pen so I wasn't as one of those points in life there was a minus in organising a lot of people money so I haven't found myself for job in call centre in 2002the end call centre because no I could trade during these and then I would work in itand in 2005 the gentleman at the gym and give is 222 and assured in my account performance like to trade with the brokerage for ICSE direct and his or her performance for those three for us and it can you do this for me and I said ok bye not Sahi Katni checkso absently managing is portfolio I quit my job and I started this advice report for the advisory company in 2005 and it's like a lot of random things in life in every every story has this tipping point where I could have easily continue to work in a call centre in Noida and telecommunication engineering collegeI would engineer study that was transferred to another Cityspokes then slowly that doesn't start going up then I became a franchise for a bigger brokers for managers Reliance head of a broken form as well for Reliance money and became a franchise forest in 2006 by then my younger brother has joined me and evolution of labour is seven years and it to me and he is a much safer than I have ever was in 2008 in a week has made some money in the market spellrealisation that you know if she is a better trader why should I tried the sense that it didn't really make sense in a trading it's all I know it's like manual work out to people can also I'm sorry I'm interrupting the middle but I have an honest curious question and before we get to the actual 0 the story you know I always have this theorem that in If You Wanna Build A startup that deals with sweepers for providing sweepers forthe road you need to be a sweeper yourself and then before you'll make the better start up so speaking specifically about trading when you said that your brother was a better trade off a new how do you actually become a better trader is it Instinct base is it like studying based is it up numbers based like how do you become a Wolf of Wall Street Kinderyou can be an average reader in study and be an average traded in a put some money on the table in your trading for a living you can put food on the table at what you are really hit home you have to have that extra and that is Genetics and I don't think you can really learn that can can I learn football and become Messi Rider mean if you need to have the cheese in your cell phonenot the genetic scan of lottery takes over right and do whatever you knowmake money not be a success no problem could be how many people view your podcast and how people view your podcast to be because of your personal and also many factors but including its not that everything was that you did you make money today you didn't make it because they could be a podcast who got a lot of use but doesn't make any money but you define success and failure of a bird in stock marketPNR sure it's very black and white no you don't make money but the way the way Messi would you rock cut people or has got given agility or whatever you want to call it specifically in a traders mind what are the genetic gifs that'll make you a better today is it just Instinct is it like ok this talk I believe in it and having the sixth sense about certain stocks is it that it's actually know that a lot of people make it out in a lot ofmovies that some of the most rest is the one who makes money attraction is opposite the people who make money trading the marquis of people most conservative water is because if this is not something that trading for one day are the one lottery when I attend a lot of trade daily at it continuously over a long period of time and being conservative that the most important thing when trading and and another instinctively alot of people like to be heroes at they want tothe shiksa take 61 runs right as an end and that's a problem with most most people never understand hero and their time do not read more than what is repository and a lot of times you know you end up becoming a compulsive trader in is the best rate in the market is when you don't read because if you are not in a trade you know your Rashi enough to see an opportunity as an opportunity for starting something right you can't even see it as an opportunity that you cannot let go of opportunities sojust be wildlife that is very tough and all around you can't read and by yourself that and that I know that whole saying is not a one day think this is a lifelong thing in this is a lot of grinding in WhatsApp if people play poker in other words the grinder is sister you wait for your good hands and then you don't just not try to keep getting a p has its source and a lot of that people don't get itnothing in India also is that the financial knowledge in school and college life college to end up doing what your parents there for you and your friends and most likely would your friends are doing wrong so know what we have to do is a country full of financial literacy not even know they understand but they don't really understand how to really go about it and that's what are the things know winhow do you fix this problem just wanna sleep it I don't think it is limited to just fine and setting is limited to a host of other soft skills including things like communication including like business which is not taught that in school which is why the whole new education policy is fantastic but the other thing I really want to highlight in this but I get from you and not talking about within the beyond return of the cold within the guy you are you are a lot like Rahul Dravid like energya lot like Rahul even the kind of trading energy you described in terms of a you know that's what you need that you need to be able to be consistent is a very Rahul Dravid is calledwhy we need to just be talked about the whole thing I also feel that when you are running a bootstrap business in a growing it gradually the same kind of mentality of consistency test test match cricket that applies it your ones and twos and not do this is something I sleep with a lot of people from Bangalore in general which is a whole section of the power breakdown later that why does Bangalore breed people like you people like Rahul Dravid with this kam 0172slow build up mentality you your brother and why is it also the startup hub but through your story I wanna know like the whole 0 the so how did you transition into saying OK you know what let's build a massive company nowthe first section of said about know why is Goddess Lakshmi sits on the photos and Saraswati sister ok byeeducation and what you learn from it was that you can't focusand others in his business and in General Life in a being right place right time is extremely important to make the greatest carrier of your life and there is no salt and Ozone it that and and I know that whole right place right time is also extremely important what I realisegood to others know if you take care of your customers really well know they will remember you and they will help you grow the world that until now 40 the we haven't spent a single rupee in advertisement not a single AdWords campaign on a single Google hai whatever it is you're 3 million customers have you done it without a single rupee and that's happening because of the same office at now we are always constantly trying to help a customer at same region of the top hundred people who joins another the first hundred they have it till datebaby 283 Vastu me one or two but not so we probably has the highest retention of employees at 1 team is 30 member team winner really anything just like this X-Men kapati and the not single person from at Activa Scooty list at 110 for success write an essential ingredient writers and it is because I need your people in need a customer and product return if people are happy and you know if customers are happy to go and talk about you and Iso I think I think that lesson who is learning was from trading actually I think my journey as a trader I become a better trader when I stop focusing on money it is in our everyday 2000scorer gold today price in this match then you are you problem of deposit your in all that you dospeaking Great new business and now with having no idea of how it works for not having any exposure to the industry and I just wake up one day and be that may be no no one or two digits phenomenon but the odds of you becoming less fees reduced significantly but don't have any core competence like to know before starting 2010 that so I started trading market13 years of experience before actually started right and this is not like the overnight in a lot of people as this is the 10 year old business today Rashi 23 about business which is it started the day I started in the market and above all things that I've enjoyed doing in my life is I am not really comfortable during my trading in my call centre life Aisa sale on the phoneKatrina folder size sold a most everything possible to this people in the US right with my student name was anyone ok so I enjoy selling on the stock market in Indiaand that's all of that it was very critical in being where is today easy money easy success is something that you when you just reading and playinggame now let's play this game 2018 28 years old in 2008 and another softwarebecame members of the stock exchange in free trading software and we have any technology background when to start a business and so this technology came for free and we saw an opportunity to offer Technology for free harvesting for free and see if we can distort the pricing if we can reduce the cost of trade and Broke lyricsrecently how the idea of the chamber in 2008 9 so that is why you're just starting something new was then nervousness within your mind was their hope like what were you thinking on a very human evolution show you had your games planned out from a product perspective from a finance perspective but what were you thinking about the human aspects of things that ok shuttle Apple leader team I know I've got my brother I am sure you had yourkinda figured out what was going on in the inner world when we start the business it was never really meant to be what it is today this is all I just take in different directions as we grow so when we start the business in 2010 we were trying to build a brokerage firm for very active day traders like us that was almost like to see this people who like Rock music set up up up with Rock music images for yourreally tight knit you know these cannot but it's just that and it is said that when we start the business of what you are trying to get after is the cost of trade off when you buy and sell stocks in India UPSC brokerage fees and and the brokerage fees in India historically has been a percentage please let me know you buy for a lakh rupees 200 se 500 rupiece commissions Dubai for 10 lakh rupees 5000 rupees but in an online worth the cost of executing a traders in Goamain Singh remains in the question was that why should the commission's go out and was the question that we were trying to ask start the business and it was busy MP344 people working from before Sarojini my brother and 2 others now and it's never Norman I never really thought through so far I didn't really think that the first onethe first one year we cannot realise that the opportunities can much bigger than than just time will it take to the small bunch of customers the opportunity is probably one of the things that scared of before starting the business was in the business of money that people don't trust nobody see that it means is the life you want to buy the 500 rupees a Chinese will go to the candy stock or manual by unit care who is running the site who ispromoter is now if you want to save final rupees you would not do it on a random decide which is in the world goes from Spain to save now you start questioning if the person is gonna be around for 20 years because my savings is a person long term is one of the custodian of my acid if you say something the money is somehow and some form lying with that business is so easy is a safe guide to be ki theall these questions and start the releasing people will so easily trust you with the money in the long time and I think I know I've seen that if I look at more than 25000security cash like mother like to think of something else and and andbusiness model and I think that moment in your journey why you discovered opportunity so specifically did you figured that O by 2020 this younger generation that kind of sprouting up in India they will perceive money in a different way was that like a part of your realisations like what was the thought process behind your went and actually got a CTO technical person Tech was your Ananda yourself but you are my kind Avengernot really on the exciting figaro KV need an all-out engineer Tech guide to go and now build something new so what was the opportunity and what was your thought process behind building out Tech and what happened in 2012branding which is I care for the customer in young block person blah blah blah and I was starting toquestion we had at that time was what is a Boat that the only motor for a business like as a product of all the product into something which is not available with anyone else and other things have done to my life I think which is help me significantly is that knowing that I think you know personally I think people who can print products today technologies are like X-Men of today's world I seriously think there at which is thereby that you don't you don't mean just take you mean even product designers of people who conceptualize audio just talking about technology is and if you are not the only oneI started doing wish I knew that I can't learn coding for not I tried it was just going all over the place and so I said how do I get close to people and programs for their child to use investing small amounts to check now se anytime I found some someone whose symbol good product and ok National Product we started significance IMO investor small check in be around that no intention ofmoney invest in some form or just you and co-founder of a company called sensible and sensible as we know it is really afraid of the original author is to be found and I was trying to bank for all that that that that time and the other product then fly visiting get regulatory approvals but somehow we both it off and I think one of the secrets for where we areyou can do whatever you want to do business but if you don't have a great product and take you too far ahead and when you when you say you hit it off with your city owner with you know this situation where as an entrepreneur you figured ok my businessthe text element and you are trying to go out and find a tech person other than the actual craft like how you are good with your numbers in your money and he is good with coding and building a product do you also have to Vibe on like an internal human-level apply that that would you look for the week is a lot of people who can work on the craft become good code of those few people who lived to connect with as a human and important to keep in practical as many people as possibleIndus coffee shop and find a co-founder find someone whom you can trust to be the product and thenabout this know how do you get the right person it is not a block no I don't think it's like asking someone to find the right person get married to let us know what you think that ok good with how do we get a guy who matters of values of what was values in the you like ok this is workingmost kill programmers and I know I know that still going on ID listin this makes it usually bring one guy who wants to just talks about money all the time in a standard why doesn't it has 2 I think IT companiesbut maybe he is not right but is it very tough to replace the person was built product not saying I think this goes back to the original point out and make which is not you try to be good enough doesn't you are good to people you end up meeting people who might think that thiswhat is fascinating should be around him that I don't know anything other than my life and very passionate and is generally have to help as many people as it is a good talent to come to youcopy paste work and listening can say that I don't know you have to be true to yourself and that's the best form of you don't think you can just copy someone else you know I just want this one which is that a lot of successful people will will definitely say that lock has been a part of my journey and right place right time is prepared by Johnny and the obvious response to that is people withnobody to all your hard work then the successful person will say no no but you don't understand how much luck is involved here and I feel that luck is definitely a huge part of everyone's only like what are the chances that you made the exact correct product this exact correct CTO who built this out with you and honestly your luck is totally decided by what you said your karma how you treat people how attractive you are as someone to work with you know dudeswould you would you like agreed that like luck is a big part with yourself the odds of getting a higher than the way to put yourself in a situation without affecting is stuck like what is not Do Ghut kar Mar it isn't it is just so you do that now you automatically put yourself in situations where everyone thinking about you know it to say it something good to me I need to reciprocate right so if you have hundred people think that about youyour chances of getting lucky increases doesn't guarantee that it doesn't but there is a way to adjust just be in that that best situation for the highest chances of getting an I completely agree on that something like just having strong ethics in life is very likely to actually create generational wealth you will create the generationalslow as compared to someone who actually break things and I get fast money but it will be larger in the long-term again that way Vs WI test match cricket kind of thing are you live score 300 runs but do it slowly do it nicelycustomers and and just be focused on improving on a daily basis and also it's the reason I highlight money in this conversation is that my observation is ok now as someone who's running zero the you have a bird's-eye view of your customers and generally the stock market is a passionate about it when you are a youtuber you get a bird's eye view of the youth in general your audience as well as what is the use of the country thinking while the excited byconcept of entrepreneurship money is a very big personal driving factor of a lot of them because they want to provide a better life for their own families and feel the nature of Indians is such that when they actually go down on your knees there are character changes that happened but only on when they like 1718 money wealth you know the glam is a driving factor which eventually changes into ok product design is a beautiful concept impact creationconcept but right now I think a lot of young kids need to be s****** into this world and then kind of develop into something else but that's just what I think man give you go on with your story so so 2010 is started 2013 when we started of product journey them in 2015 we did our interesting thing and Kailash and in a Press Conference of flight delayedthe Angry Bird having a drink and I said did I haven't done anything for violin and which is which zero brokerage for equity investinglooked upon as a brand only for active traders and not for investors ride the the problem is with a business that is the 99% of people you know around your investing that means the trading community even the contribution of turnover of the stock exchange they are very small number of people that so in India you probably have 5 to 10 lakh De traders are active traders to generate revenues in of people like us but that is 70 80 like Indians to invest in the market70 80 lakh Indians win was contributed only 1% of the exchange server side know if we cannot build business only for traders will never be able to go after that it like Indians to invest in the market services we want to change our can of branded sofa set why not put this Katra vigo zero professional it take away all the brokerage charges and its wide variety is it for the first time in 2016abhi to the decision on a Saturday and then by 100 profession and an economic times are the whole thing was 10 businessmen to watch for in 2016 and I was Mukesh Ambani and next to it was put my name pride and then I'll take you to thesetride in this business credibility is very important people associate credibility when the paper scissors for newspapers TV and power in a real trajectory shift happened in 2016 and in 2015 we are also launcher in house production about k&n Of Kailash and his team building in which is a weapon trading app launched that 2016 is when we started not doing well but theplease challenge for the business was onboarding a customer we had like this study page document which are to be signed and how many prove that to be attached that would have happened if before sitting in a documentKYC for signature and other and Ashok 2017 is when it really started Taking Off it is we could now on board customer completely online and the during this journey in between 2015-16 we also did a few interesting things we launched in 2014 our education initiative called what city which is probably in the top two three in the worldI want to learn anything about stock is completely free there is no zero the branding nothing we just do it out of love in a way to give back to the society so we all spend a lot of time and not just the format is very Vicky plus coronavirus in article has a lot of 2 and at the end of the article that it really well in all this investment in startups asset now standard do we be formalized it and started in incubator quality in matterInnova to apply 40 50 crores of what we had made it was a fun and we said we will now enable new startup to kambil nice experiences to grow the capital market ecosystem in the country through it all it all primarily in the world of Finance at your train expandall this compliance issues we can take care of all of that and most importantly we give the initial audience to validate your product at the biggest challenge in the business of money is just to get your first few customers to trust you diamond and end with what we've done is always the start of your showcase their customers say you know this is almost like us and give it a shot and tell us what you think of it and just doing that has helped the start of their all in allphone very successful in a n all making money today is not think that I feel very excited about this new Startup ideas to become business of Throne so that call Re Mai To the round 12 startups that I will be done on fintech as well but it is smo passion but but for the passionate things away fundador allmarket related products in companies 2018 2017 it suddenly changed the world forest completely still January 12 million customers in the largest broker in the country by customers to add 2 million customers in 6 monthsbecause you have this Birds eye view of your audience your consumer what is going on now via people suddenly getting more interested in financial education and fintechs is that young people again is it the same concept of young people are chasing wealth somewhere and that's why people like latching onto this what your opinion on thatthe first thing that happened in the country is the interest rates are really low in the bank ATM in US your fixed deposit is giving you find a person and then stuff that it should automatically people are looking for an alternate ways in alternate places to invest into an American IL higher than the fixed deposit in all the other thing is this whole work from home is enable people to think about personal finances because the 16 people who work in the continuously working itcome home they already tired I don't really have too much think about how I think people sitting at homepeople get attracted to discounts and that happened also and only you have dogs available at 50 60% the cost and then those stocks bonds By April May June stock market well so so people who invested a lot of money and which meant they started speaking about it to the French that I go to make money in the market so all of this happened together andonboarding is today online read it sort of like the four so all of this put together the fact that I think I just enough created this whole lot of people in the market it can also be seen in the other 400 retail brokerage firms that in our retail broking Stock Broking is copy of the oldest industries in the country the Bombay Stock Exchange is the oldest stock exchange in Asian soIndia series has had passed to the stock markets in relation to the stock market for a long time in this whole last 6 months lot of these brokers for offline they've lost out because all the business models were in a wide around offline processes that I send sound pickup check after you buy a stock insufflated admin that does not so that the top 5 Din online book is happen again a lot of market share from themwhat you see in the last 6 months is that our everyday for customers with 32246 28 today so it's just so there's a lot of No 22 year old for coming week challenge of this thing about this you know where this doesn't have the money unfortunately the money in Indiaput out recently Singh 75% of all wealth is with people or more than 50 years of age so that the problem challenge of building a business for 23rd year olds in a business of money is that you have a lot of customers know this customers together and only had 1 Tola in which is the one place where we haven't done very well which is we haven't done very well in this audience of 50 year old + crowdthis audience needs in a relationship manager as they need someone to call our prints a good day good morning sir good afternoon I know they produce a certain way of life and they don't really appreciate their elderly care for product experience as much as a younger than 2230 year old my dad like this cold Android phone in every time I try to give menu phone is like no no I like this betterand that's that one place where no we're not been very successful which is attracting the 45 + crowd to company consideration so the way I look at it I mean I feel like your sitting on this volcano of growth eventually because I just feel that young people now lekin the early twenties is a lot of entrepreneurial energy is a lot of energycomes to again personal finances there is a lot of thought and ok how do I growth that next level because honestly considering the fact that I'm guessing a big chunk of your audience is Tier 1 cities in India like a and therefore I am in your consumers Tier 1 cities in India and therefore they are very influenced by the west the very influenced by America the area enclosed by the garyvee is of the world I don't know familiar with Gary Vee but hisis entrepreneur from America does Lord social media content he promotes the idea of growth challenging yourself and even when we hire people for Monk entertainment which is a Media company so when the hiring 22 year olds the extremely different from what I can I was when I was 21 am just five years older than them but the thought process is completely different so is that something that will think about a lot because I am assuming you do considering the fact that you design the minimalist app you are consideringfact that that is a big chunk of your audience that any of the online 29 is where you'll really see the growth of zero the thing every single thing that today is for that crowdin terms of today's world you have to leave the retirement age has come down from 60 to 55 I don't know a lot of people know about it but as and when the retirement age is reducing that means post-retirement where are you don't own a salary you have a lot of time to spend which means that you have to start saving for your retirement as early as possible and while while there is a lot of excessive consumerconsumerism is a problem in this country largest people in our spending on the credit card on the first day of the month and then tried to make up another member but there is a small chunk of audience in you bunch of people who understand that saving for retirement is an important concept right and I think we need to find a way to make sure the entire route things that you can just have a small portion of this 2230 old saying know what my dad retarded 60 but Imytret 5255 10 years lesser to save enough for my retirement right so you know if you start earning a 20 and say you save 253 after 30 years of earning and you have maybe another 20 30 years of living of your savings at how much do you need to save and the cost of living is continuously growing up today and you can disable it so I can see that other peopleprofit in electric section of the 20 to 30 years old but there is also a big section 22 3rd year old who wants to buy just a person wants 50000 rupees 10 spend one lakh rupees in iPhone which is the most stupid things right but but people get caught by this consumerism and I think our marketers and advertisers make it also it's almost like a must-have today doesn't like latest phone related issues the latest whatever itwhat photos also happened in the covid-19 outbreak in spending on this in a discretionary staff which means there is any Gautam and access to this money which was getting spent A device which is also the reason I think why people like us and other businesses like a certain is that money in the bank instead of going and finding its way to a Nike shoes for iPhone as in a proper gone into another Reliance Industries shareIndia some stock is scaling the climate in the planet is problem for the climate change on on on multiple levels to it's not just climate change its it's probably I think over time I begin to look at it as a very minor part of self-harm also because the more you own you know the more your prone the misery but that just as a deep spiritual theorythat later going to launch this mobile education city is also a lot of n and anything that financial education is broken down into small little known intimidating can of ways to teach people French and that's the soldier doing quite wellthe startup ecosystem that we're working with their build a lot of very cool and products for the 2013 rules and that's also can of India has the highest number of the worldthis progress so when it comes to financial behaviour now your someone who is an expert in terms of the world finance and they would be good to great financial behaviour and then they will be the obvious trend in financial behaviour that happens after covid over the next 10 years will it take the stairs after covid both the next day news what is good financial behaviourwhat do you think will happen over the actually much will people actually get so educated financially that the trend your predicting will be the actual best case scenario train personal situationseem to say that overall back to normal I don't think so is this I thought this weekend and their three people in this beautiful resort namaskar have hundred families right so this is a listed company in USA and my friends who run gyms in excel in a like saying no you need to open an opening tomorrow I think there are expecting people to walk in the enquiry is coming in just because its openingbig behavioural change that will happen and the which means that it is 8 and half job should be created at home how do you create new jobs in this country but if you if it is whole bunch of jobs are getting lost in less money being spent by people how do you create new jobs if there is no no job no other optionincrease taxes or find other ways to take money from people 1 month I don't really know what is the right around what's the right solution to this problem I think the first thing we all open and should four countries are there is a vaccine out soon and because we are there were all in such a thing as a proper religion for this world right now and certainly no in this religion if people stop spending money write the religionit's almost like in a like how going to temple with Amos accessories for most important that you didn't survive in capitalism I think you need like you know people to be spending money for it to survive and and now this situation where people have stopped in at think so I am I am coronavirus for the next few years so unfortunately the problem is I am in a business where I can't do anything much by being brushthe conflict of interest as a business in I can't stock and sale today and then buy back up to three years we have to be just preparing ourselves to survive this now what we think next 2-3 years of it experience the behaviour of a 22 year old I think the last six months is been I think the most most people in the world have gotten lucky the last six 5 six months with leather furniture speakersproblem come down when it comes down to the behaviour of all those people who thought they were this financial Ji Ne assistant and send me your sitting on stocks have lost in value what do you do that and historically would have seen it last 25 years is when stocks don't do well in the loose some money people become the sale at the stock recovery and then I'll much more moneyagain not good for us for business and we have been trying as a company to inculcate some good habits and the trading platform so for example by the penny stock a penny stock as top which really doesn't have a real business behind it is test papers as a company where there is a like it is interesting trivia does one address in Calcutta weather 200 listed companies in one addressOdisha all companies A trading on stock exchange and so it's so people end up buying Sach talk to you by a socket 1 Rupee in routing income 10 rupees right but this one is stock really has no in array and value at all that what you done reside in a we don't have a penny stocks to be purchased a platform that we are saying that is protect the people from Windows 10 mistakes but still said that so many of these behaviourpeople now which which is very tough to change and I think right click and Wi-Fi to and how this will play out of the next six months 1 year but I think when market come down a lot of this new first time investors who came to the market there will there's a way that lets wait it out its way to the stock markets recover before we invest more money which is not the right way to play it the right way to play the stock market is not toflight timing it because no one can time that I think the right way to do this is a certain portion of your income to income of savings to the stock market and then do it over a period of time I don't try to put all of it at one time in sync with his come on redmi buy or sell at I don't think that's right way to do it ideas to be systematic investment amount of money over time because no one knew that dollar cost averaging at the college coaches you bye5000 pieces month next next month fighter take a sip of water you called so over a long period of time in your average cost in 10 to come down and it so much that we for someone to play it was 25 years so I can take if if I have to walk on a tightrope and of a profession as our practices for 10-15 years and then I am doing the tightrope walk right person was no knowledge about Stock Marketright way to play it also says that if someone in listening things that they want to be treated like me and I can tell you after book blowing up my account and struggling for like like 5 to 7 years the lesson I learnt is that don't risk more than you can up more than what you can afford to lose weather is today when I am doing anything I would take more than 1 to 2% of my personal network ondesign of the defect blows out I lose one to two person it's not always Bounce bike people don't think that a lot of problems when people are smaller amounts of money Saiya 1 lakh rupees in saving how do you take a 1000 rupees better is what they think or say 5000 rupees people want to put into one stock in and buy everything with advanced and hope to get luckyNehru Hindustani market shop is released Regina so it's listening the plan is rupees find 10 stocks from different sectors in industries distributed across it now if you want to become a speculator take 10000 rupees in this one lakh rupees and speculate leverage whatever it but keep make sure that you enough to

time and I don't I don't have any regrets about it it made me stronger only it made me very you know independent only visor lot of things visor yes and intelligent at the same timegetting a basics so it has a lot of value you I am thankful for that kind of situation that I got before we get actually into details story of what happened how many years and we became so close I want to just give you all brief overview of what he does who is the head of content at Josh talks today not heard of content I used to have research at Josh talks ok and now I had culture and growth ok but that's one of the many things you do a consultant to showbig companies to work on tedx Gateway friends I mean it would be great to say friends because when you say consultant it's like you draw money but too many people I talk to and I am not that person who hasn't lost money out of here in all those things even though you can I can but I don't feel the want of it I am ok I'm in I am very very happy that kind of work that I am doing with Josh talks very very dear and very close to my heart I know you've seen it personally how we work there and accessin love with the team their Shobhit superior to all these guys with internal of them alot and you know we like family also on like a Startup level u someone who is like help The Lord of the start of jio Sim SIm the youtubers meet them we talked for a couple of hours and something comes out so I don't take credit for it because I had a conversation something came out it came from inside me or whatever came out of me is not mine anymore so I cannot holdthe right of content or privacy copyright after it's your so I cannot go and market kinew 2011 think like that by being like just the small consultant on the Sara Bam enter the whole team that what is pretty much done for monkey is well also on a yogic level dude because of your family lineage the staff your Nanaji taught us you are extremely advance spiritually Avenue can say that I am in either the there is no scale to measure out there is no certification or there is no level in that ok your own level 12 1113 if they are there all Fallsare there in the market that level 1 yoga level 2 yoga it all Falls it's a journey and there cannot be levels of it and there is no age of 18 doors level may be a five-year-old tomorrow will be more specific spiritually advanced put together all the spiritual person in the world we don't know about it and maybe a 16 year old will not be issued at once at all that the reason I come across too many people in my life who are Hue older than my age but I end upkind of giving them something and I have met couple of very young people and like the way you know younger than me and they taught me a lot of things but also like to think that just stabilizer it also helps your mind clot in the brain works faster unlock your potential it it it it just breaks your thought process it makes you think out of the box and I feel entrepreneurs need a spiritual side it everyonebut probably the people who need the most of people working on a Saturday 27 11028 creativity Who need that extra bit of stamina to work on weekends things like yes I tell I always tell this thing there are two things in the world one you become rich another you become wealthy and when I say rich that means may be money but when I say well see you have a lot of things in it and spiritual it is one of them to have Bridge quality with even within you is very very important and there it islike how common sense is there is same thing like common sense is very easy right but not everyone whole set same is spirituality it's easy but of paath God so earlier we come to the story and why we give you as a background on all days because I just threw probably the bulb Buta of the story but through the bulb of the story cable secan you coming to the topic a great Akbar hai madam so baccha India versus at about hundred thousand Sahab may be less than that I was going to be giving a big fan of public speech at some event a Manish of mentoring the team that can use working as a consultant that I used to take care of the Social Media Part of it so one of my core inputs for always to meet speakers and advise them ki boliye Kyunki yah marketable Hai yah boliyethat was my role was trying to make the stock as commercial advance Excel syllabus marketable sellable what about you so the process of the organisation is that they take your life and write it down on the board they ask you detailed questions about your life they ask you ki Bachpan mein kya kiya tha is not Josh talkswritten down on the board little creepy and emotional it is through the process like you know I think 10 people asking you what is question what you think this point why did this lead you to that very intense situation for the person in question which is near that point are all very emotional love you know that they struggle to even get to like hundred thousand subscribers on that journey of Hustle 10 growing a YouTube channel to consider the next video the next everyone taken business the next thing you want to do in life are you don't have time to think ofstruggle there that's why did but when you see in February Hollywood am not give it to you if we do the same exercise with you now you will actually do it with a lot of these without getting all the anxious National because your camera as a person year now and you are not you are very unstable there you are a younger by age also to three years three years back and on top of that you know the kind of habit you had the time that so that brought a lotstability and you can a person and that that is the that is the biggest problem of the youth of our country today and irrespective of whether they are bombay-pune or Nashik for Delhi or the smallest village that you can think of a Goa Goa I have I know you guys in Goa to write bro in terms of this is again a lot of this is the first talking about this on the YouTubetoo much need in my life asali non veg in like form use of the day as it gets up and I would check in in like my letters and it it then for lunch I would have liked chicken breast then for the at the four o'clock to make poha Nagpur shredded chicken inside then have eggs before going to the gym and probably at night they have fish a lot of red meat coronavirus and this is the case for maybe I think some of 2012 to 2017 If I Was Your Manevery single day of done that and other stuff and that of a lot weekend every single weekend I had to be at least one or sometimes two days of life hard core drinking binge drinking on weekends with an intense face of life and come out of Engineering College by drinking culture of such a victim of drinking a lot of alcoholism problem also on the channel and wait for it of course like the rest of India are used to consume marijuana also I had joined this habitmaking cannabutter which is that you take ghee and you take a little but this recipe is to the people edible can smoking but in terms of eating out like these people consume Bhang you know it's kind of a version of that you heat with button you can I don't Bread Toast and eat it like that but now in my life that literally no intoxicant because the biggest intoxicantintroduced in my life for you which is the process of spiritual we will get to that leaders will know what this these intoxicants do in the short term is given escapism will give me the party but the long-term the experience so you might even be able to work well you might even be creative value by any more creative and you but when you are not have any or so but then you can hear your whole stability is the light and reducing that there is no life and you have no motivationthe mean meet part was that it's OK to eat me time in C are not against the people who eat meat in their choice I am just going to put the fact out and this is not my theory you can Google it is there and it's that how is very simple is a common service at common sense is very very you know uncommon think of this which all animal in in in in animal kingdom all the animals that the eat meat and all the animals that they eat grass now and also think the waveare award like humans how they were from you know when you take signs you will see that you are monkeys and then you become chimpanzee in EPS in whatever and then you become human know who cleans today before assuming there are 4 and 5 more categories of humans which are extinct now see their physiological development biological development was completely different change time to time right why do we have molars and teeth which can grind food why do we have found that we have in theOK get system organ system is around I think Naina 14 metre in between 9 and 40 metre long same for the cause or other reviews animal at the same time if you compare the title tiger and all the meat eating animal there was short but system that is just the canines and atmost increases because they eat by tearing and we eat by showing bright so that gives a fact the whole digestivethe acid that we have in our stomach and all we are not now evolved and not designed to consume meet physiological biologically so we actually not doing good to our body and to the environment to the environment and now I am sure people must have read about what happened in Amazon in lord of scientists have come up and said that too much of meat consumption is lead to what happened directly or indirectly the butterfly effect climate change meet is directlysiebel admin there are a lot of theories you can read and people who used to be meet consumer scientist from the west as a fashion in India right people invest in fact Arnold Schwarzenegger LeBron James people like that are actually you living meet living need Virat Kohli Virat Kohli for that matter used big use online chicken order in Virat Kohli now how is become his I think he's become vegan also is also left dairy product and all and and at the same time she understands his own the fittest athletesin the world right he is at the peak of his career is scoring so many runs and business also is doing Gudiya part from cricket is a lot of this is a very entrepreneurial and as the role that is being given Captain is come out as much as I'd like no one no one can talk anything about Virat Kohli today is why is what the outcome was his very loyal to his exercises what he eats reading whatever he reads he teaches himself a lothi meditation also have got to know and I am sure he must be doing yoga in all those things and his read the same book that we all read autobiography of Yogi you Kiya mentioning that you know that book brought a lot of impact in my life that the whole reason I suggested that you will come to so I mean sea and this is what happened so again I am I want to tell it to everyone is your choice but if you love the earth understand there is no otherthis leads no where else is green right no no other planet has 21% of oxygen that you we are all surviving on today if you care for it if you want your kids are your generation to have a good place I think you should concealer at least going down reducing and slowly if you can leave it is great if not it's your choice it's a very personal call coming from a mediatormeet all my life is you can get addicted to the taste of what are you can't imagine life without chicken biryani mutton galouti kebab smells the particular when it makes your mouth water sausages Mela particularly in the mummy a mouth water so it's very difficult to just tell someone to leave need that voice has come from inside you if you feel like your system is now rejected that when you do and unexplained your Hawa letter also it's not like Manish told me was ki leave me dayla producer tell me Brazil ok but maybe after your this chicken biryaniagain living meat is very personal leaving alcohol and weed that whole other station near and that I want to talk to you about dudh what does alcohol in we do to your to the system of a young person in the long term a lot of people using database MySQL in corporate culture corporate culture in the soul of smoking cigarettes ok but generally does a lot of binge drinking and smoking among the youth so why You're turning to portalbringing so much why did I drink and eat so much what I am sorry to be a little heart sure but I want to blame the Western world hear about it we know all the things that you listen and you read that O Bhole Baba Shankar Bhagwan used to smoke up and all Bulshit it was never that he didn't need all these things and also UC Sadhu is an already know people say na very good Rishikesh illusion Banaras very goodNagababu smoking open all of you talk to them and all only those smokeup who do not go to that level to help them to get to that level again to the level the leave it how does it help you get to the whole point is it makes you like out of your mind it just help you focus on One Direction understand some very dangerous thing to have which is the Yog is the leave it but the youth they don't end up leaving their make this that life is a justifiedand I I have come across popular videos on on bicep channel or Ranveer allahbadia about it she lets talk science what does alcohol or what does weed or whatever name you have for that does is it is just chemical it enters your body and it stimulates some other chemical to make something else and again if you go to brown will put about Acetone in general talk aboutin all those things what does not happen with time it becomes one of the component of your chemical system of body and when you don't get that that's the time you feel very lethargic you feel angry and all because your blood demands it your your system demands it that's what is called addiction right so that is what alcohol and we does it it actually makes you a slave of of of the component of the chemicalsinto the body when you don't need it our body is capable enough to manufacture those good feel good hormones automatically and there are Yogi processes for it there are special processes for it and is not rocket science it is very simple it needs practice examples where it return to that for my party was working so hard it was little is a Raja Swaraj and Michael and we were really giving it off1000% at night after my work was done I always wanted to kill better without realising that wait I can give my 50000 % if I choose not to chill in the moon what do you call it hot box that I didn't eat like but nowIPS and compare the script with the script that you right now you'll get exactly and not that shortcuts that shortcut kar lo kar lo also close to 35 people working at andmy brain won't work asked in Amazon app there are enough example in in in front of others who've been slave of this National internationally and amazingly talented people going losing the life I read the other day about this but what is the name the Tennis player Boris Becker I read a very nice tennis player was bankrupt because he had a drinking habits alcoholnew multiple wives and all those things whatever Maradona I read about Maradona oh my god I am in such a legendary player that many examples in Bollywood in of people and amazing artist losing the life for this pretty things here is a writer and come back to the story so dude what was your first impression when when I did my whole story of an hour is my problemare used to ok I used to sleep in a very comfortable bed with AC ON and I was restless I said OK Google there are people sleeping on the fly over under flyover as well right so I mean it's ok everyone struggle struggle you should never understand our good bro to tell the story of you try to find out who am I and what is so now coming to contact of my life that point I had gotten already into spirituality is very entry by the concept ofread the scientific aspects of it we learn reikiangry and I can tell you that this guys on angry guide the most in the roomyou told me about a family history of how deep is your love and spirituality how much meditation within how many hours you done and for those of you who know anything about meditation Manish asike very very award for those of you don't know anything about meditation he is playing like semi Professional football if like a professional footballers like Sab Guru aur like se I don't I don't end of the comparison your because I had initially as well you know and and might be morethen what I am and actually they are right so so anyone who can bring themselves into some focus our spiritual so we all have to practice and that what is coming back to the story to bro what was like your opinion on that situation that happened CRM a person who does not form in your opinion like it is against the rules of spirituality or spiritual people don't do it when you cannot call yourselfI was just saying things were true and that seem like it is you actually took it on your ego and then after that everything is what I was doingtell you bro still all this exercise happening for you are good only you be sure to frustrated ki mujhe Kyon poochh Rahe Mujhe gallbladder ke bare mein Kyon poochh rahi hai mujhe like all that I just trying to get to that person you don't like that so what I dobring the whole process was just telling you to come I also remember at that point we had just launched Monk entertainment and my pets to that team was let me do a talk on how to create a business from scratch with that had successfully done by myself and I was verified successfully on containment at that point also the team like Gandi rejected you why should we get a young kid to give a talk on Bigg Boss when we have an option of getting like an established business my belief and it still is that you should never die youngI I get a fun and what you been doing on the channels and I decided against doing that ok without you know I'd rather than talk to my own channel and tell people what I'm doing I remember when I said that it completely ok to say no you're not feeling like it so I did they know and I eventually started frustrating you a lot on my phone calls because I knew I had like that weed problem I had alcohol problem and I would like call you after the broken I justtwo wheeler licence needed at a need a big brother marriage that I haven't had a mentor in my life I had one mentalism Tanmay but for me I be back in the day he was the first to give me all my digital knowledge and then I'll not get in touch with them so I need that one big brother my life to just tell me what are you doing them in the correct this is what you should be doing next so now I want to correct you here with a little bit you said that you called me and you frustrated me but I have not had bothered you and what I do not trust itthe whole point if I would have been frustrated but never met I could just said that do you know what actually doing a lot of things that time I was working as a consultant at Reliance so I was very busy with the and hours working with a very senior team that was I was actually busy I had level of responsibility on my shoulder and the other organisation which I was a part of and couple of more things such as being too many things so but but what I scanned of you and I said that okthis flower needs to Bloom this bird needs to Bloom and as a result what I will call it is I actually did a part of whatever I could and I live the dream within inside you whatever I want to do in my life and I was not able to do because of my responsibilities and situations and family and everything I lived that he knew that fire I put in you and you did wonderful job you did hundred timewhat I could have done no I am I am very frankly saying please and I am through you I am also telling you telling this to all the brothers and sisters that we know in our content world like Avon projector Nikunj and too many people Gaurav Bhai and all you guys are incredibly talented incredible people of actually writing a new history of the nation and I am notI am doing my version am saying this can I take you through this phone in the can you quickly tell me one positive thing about each person here even very creative and Nikunj very straight had been focused that be unique flying beast Gaurav bhai balanced he is a package amazing package and projector projector is very very what you say like ambitious she wants to like hit all the stops in our number one yearshe wants to be there like no like me and that's a good thing to have and what you see in Verizon me that you like this was very clearly that the things that you guys will create the country will remember the concept of Ranbir the concept of Viraj is gonna be there for thousands of years it's not gonna fail Hue aadami having a work wife relationship like co-founder relation is very hello then what do you say the relations with Rajat you have hi my work my phoneI have two eyes I do I do that to be in the know I know I knowthank you know maybe we'll talk about it in some other content we have seen the kind of thing ever seen why didn't you tell me to leave something like wheat from the beginning why do it because everything is the process I remember and I know that one time when we were sitting at the holy see I guess he was group 1 Purnima not group 1 Purnima and that they also your pretty hai N spoke to me and I didn't react and why did I didn't commentSuhail not talk to you right now and I spoke to us for our right was also very damaged in the day you said you mad and againmost valuable thing to you which is the time of their life by watching the video how can I retrieve them so I think this is very beaten down in life that point the problem also some wrong people around me you know wrong voices thing as I was having this conversation I remember you should an interview with pesto Tech you heard about this quote right that you are a result of what 5 books to read and five people you are wrong but today is in Digital contact little changed because on socialand too many people follow you you follow to many people and their friends and pure groups and family and everything you actually become something you become a result of you become an example of the 500 people were connected online so this is for all people watching please be very careful of who you subscribing to and what kind of content with their voting so entertainment is a different thing altogether please send all entertainment created useryou need entertainment unit comedy you need plaster unit songs with whatever you like you know but but when it comes to open the native talks be very careful who you are and a lot of people who created so called in for teaching on negative of like those people who talk about hostel in business and what are the younger than anything that they should bebusiness of the Giving talks on bro so you should not if you're not practice which is also wearing Manish really post viraje me hard to grow Monk entertainment fast and big because if at all I am that guy who is going to talk about working hard in creating business that should be a very solid business rather than just beerbiceps to be appreciatedbest that is well I know I'm talking about and entering my team on the next Aata Bacchan the education space more on that some other time want to come back to you and your process of mentoring and the only person who invented do din like comment like someone human to what do you look for you look for some kind of trades pahle Savere call put my time and effort into this person if he has these things some park in a couple of things dedication and discipline is Mastif I am giving you my time and if not respecting what I am saying I am going to say thank you and be friends but if you show that sin that ok whatever instructions or whatever talks that we had and and your implementing things to watch it even if I see one percent of it then I'll put my time so anyone like too many people today text me and all on Instagram on Facebook also think that I am doing the startup can help me in all very very prepared and do your homework before reaching out to anyone like for example let's say ifstartup today whatever our business we doing and where we are or whatever if we have to go Galaxy an ideal situation if you have to go to investor and investor that say that sir please invest this money back for Disney Cruise in our business we need to go with a lot of homework done right that who we are where we are who are our competitors market analysis and they must be there are a lot of data points that we need to prepare ourselves andthen they will give you money they will give you money or time after you show some so that's what I want that you should prepare in anything like for example even if your going to subject teacher to ask some doubts make sure that you are the basics clear I feel strongly thatpractice that don't make it a content and put it out like I cannot like like now we are in such relation that you know we are you ask me strongly on what kind of content you are putting too I now have that liberty to tell you where an end it been in the past also that you made some content and have strongly rejected it saying that don't put it out because we have not done it ourselves have not done it yourself then how can you put it out like I cannot allow you to talk about thenot about it I know the basics but I am not practiced it myself like to that level that I can talk of that it's always great to listen to people who have done it read the book of the people ofone beautiful thing is that our nation is a nation of possibility and our nation is a little emotional cultural Nation write it still been and always will be because our roots that so why I say that is if you have a million subscriber that means 10 lakh writing million in lakh people with you have your 10 lakh people backing you imagine that this will be sabse mil gaya tha Kitna hoga to create that something which can give you the tent andso that you can meet your wealth at the same time give back to give back some park and how you are giving back today like how Manga entertainment and bicep is giving back is by designing something for kids and giving it I don't know you live free or it will be chargeable or whatever but you spoke to Radhakrishnan sir you spoke to Kiran collapse and you spoke about the idea you had in my head and they approved and then you bro to me and then be discussed at do it right so it like that everyone hascapable and am I am seem also couple of youtubers defaulter already started someone is selling t-shirts online someone is selling something someone is designing I met a very interesting youtuber original youtuber in Delhi region from his from Delhi only I am talking about Mahatma Ji technical and meet him very very nice guy he is design courses of Abhinav Abby viral that we know right strap and all those motivation he has some online coursesdoes this guy has been doing not like yesterday they been doing for that last for your build apparel business on YouTube even Nick voonik he is doing something on the burner really always talked to a Viraj about starting a new business imagine today an asset that you have is you don't have to spend on marketing you will just have to make a video and put it out that early and peopleand forget about hard core marketing because you been to loyal to your fans you been to lower the people who described they will believe in what you're giving them and they will say ye mera bada bhai Kono nai matlab tomorrowif they are trying launch something as a product and they want to sell the vehicle is very easily than someone who starts a product from scratch pkcs12 market and market your platform ready so that there is a nice day this that you are all potential but it's about how much hard working but it's also very difficult to go from being a youtuber in the world of you do this to my glamourone thing which comes along is a bubble of being celebrity I always tell people like I tell you I I think I sometimes very hard I am very hard on you when I say things I see that how many people subscribe on you and you will say that ok total of 2.3 2.4 million eyes and converted to LAX USA 24 lakh I said now compare the population we have in the country at 135 crore right now calculate the personare you tell tell yourself or your celebrity how to know if you fall sick tomorrow will people pray and you have one for you know right you are in a bubble of being a celebrity and its I mean people who take it positively you've seen them prosper people who just pass 8 are there that would be seen youtubers go down we see in big companies go down I know that when we take you for YouTube parties Lakshmi pointand that was good that was afraid for we're so when you are talking about the people of freight forwarding seeing them doing wrong there is no Rocket Science the behaviour if you observe people the kind of behaviour they have the way the shake hands the way they meet people greet people it will give you behavioral traits right and it is it is all about common sense and yes because of some spiritual advancements I can like a couple of things and in which you are better editionwhich is not to be misused night I always tell you like you keep sending pictures and you say yeah Banda kaun hai kya and I tell you that I know this is not really correct we should not do this and and and when required we do it in the talent management and its always by God's grace is always been correct of where we are now this is not judging understanding people who they are we are we going to invest timeare we going to are the open enough to take take some submissions of thoughts and change few things to know that a lot of female youtubers who you made me speak to a knife set couple of things never done it and the feeling good about it and it's been in technical also and a couple of cases team at Josh talks and also helped them have taken people to officers and her shoes crazy guy in our office is help them like read their analytics and tell them and also it's it's both Technical Advancementwhat you can do on personality gone away from allotment School that the nature of a podcast do you know you're kind of to be the cutoff one negative element at a time which is usually what I was a fitness course I tell people don't take away diet is it is cut off one negative thing from your diet remember that so do like you first coronavirus alcohol alcohol that is easy toillegal for a wire or even leave social dragging the completed don't touch that said that what I believe and now I understand you only have to come out why call coming from beerbiceps I literally name the channel with the intention of telling people you know what it ok to drink and it ok to drink beer and others me being like a Lil rebellious and anger in my life that point shame that that name that came out of the Angry faces devices is my career today but now I tell people as muchmy call is not everyone's cup of tea again if you want to drink if not ready to give up don't some days now after heavy drinking session when you get the hangover 1 voice inside your head my tell you that maybe this is inbuilt for you listen to that voice please don't drink don't given to it again if your friend group drinks a lot drinks to unal D levels stop hanging out of them that I strongly believe it was the first thing you are so I think you knowwhat happened at that moment I remember that moment when I told you that bro you should consider giving up alcohol Dhire Dhire you know what I did I looked into you and your thinking it already and I just said that this was that what happened so I think it was the right moment of both of us meeting and your actually thinking you had some were understood that your Daru Peene se mera loss ho raha hai main gussa ho raha hun mainrelationship between is a raha hai use Jagah De ho rahe feeling that I just ignited that thought and and said discipline dedication and you followed that that was how is your win I have nothing to contribute I think you're kind of trained me through that process yes I know that you are going to load a lot more work into my life was eventually and this is the first step in that is the phase where I said that why don't you write a book 1 Phase I newsomething happening acid why don't you start Hindi and Hindi is 1 million + family now you know about the weed like that was something which is difficult for me to leave comment was horrible for healthy to fat for shopit's been branded like this is cool thing this is come think this is people who are what girls think about and people who like happy in life and people who was successful in life do I think I don't knowAvon Mark Zuckerberg when he came back to India he became more spiritual I don't know if it did smoke or not I don't know it so it's wrong to say the fact but I think I think the at that face my life was definitely variant launched for the Videocon and also the friend hang out with a big weed smokers and if you hang out with them I think that only talk about weed and only talk about has a very intelligent it so the conversations of Vedas amazing very intelligent weed is amazingdespite being a youtuber with like a subscription-based why don't you answer this question now last last one and half your you been intense meditation and yoga and you enroll yourself to the school which is guiding which has in a 500 years of research in yoga and and spirituality and so what what did change for you ok so I think that's cool 31 the big reason this state I kept staying away from we have not tested in a long time and I am not afraid to admit now that I didShadow problem back then ok but now this two things yoga dost you one is that it will give you that escapes in that you are desperately looking for in your current meditation sessions you meditate for half an hour 45 minutes to go to learn the technical way of doing meditation the value of a backstage you believe in a certain pattern and you are actually able to stimulate the goldfields inside as without relying on excellent substance even talking about it makes you feel when youmeditation session can I book a more saturated right now the world that are now the wind fuse Aisa now if you just like ringtone without having exactly what I wanted to know from you that stone work that you use right now I'll give you I'll give you the second aspect of this is not understand but I am going wrong in thiswish you only use 10% off your waiting mind like and when you awake and your working only 10% of your brain but if you do yoga you start unlocking the remaining 90% slowly and scientifically proven I would advise everyone to go and watch series on Netflix it on brains I think it's called the prince and their spoken that how yoga and meditation actually helps you unlock the endlessit is of what mind can do and they have come to India and their habits of our scientists have come to India and they have seen Yogesh live without food or drink water and survive there are some Yogesh who eat one time a day and function they Walked In the chilliest mountains with just a Robe that was just one dhoti on the body when you're wearing thermal and whatnotcoming back to say this for lack of a better word for lack of a better reference window closes word in English to say this would be super powers and when you can't you can't Meri Aankhon Se laser niklega it's not that aur mein Jameen favourite Jaunga that is an event coming back to basics of these on human level u become extremely kam that the Siddhi Siddhi means it is an achievement is achievementgetting from one Level to another that because being why is it called it better in long-term I just feel like these are one of those things that initially Kisi very motivated would sticking to yoga process usually what is happening to my world why am I able to see through people right now I am able to understand that what this person is kind of thinking about why is why all the colours were separated by more atyoga becomes at educate yourself on you realise hold on this is the tip of the Iceberg exactly and as a lot lot when you should not be excited because of this small small things spiritual world is really funny also through a lot of tests they will make you see through a person or they will make you understand a person better or couple of things about gas couple of things about the past and the present or maybe something that person is doing in life right nowbut if you start feeding on these things you will lose that the reason I always say that we should not always see pictures and get into people's mind and you know that there are very good judge not not judge it is observation observation of insidebecause of my creative processes and even once in a while I again got released Own It would go a for 2-3 weeks the piece was going for 2-3 week would go away and address be like know where I want that again I remember I was to satguru's video and it made a lot of sense to me someone asked him a question saying that he asked questions and what do you want to ultimately achieve and that persons at peace thenany set piece is not something that should be a goal we should be requirement job fair in good habit should you require media and I mean you happiness is not definition of the journey exactly the peace became a journey alag not going to spoil this journey with that blob of weed yes you know so that kind of weichai just let it go after point and finally coming down to non veg ok now keep in mind while the power of the Germans were kind of needed the non veg 2really maintain my musculature is definitely reducing them become vegetarian but the advantages the living on which has given me can make a hundred and ten thousand times for losing a little bit of a musculature ok for example an extremely cool in the head like you can't imagine I feel isomers technology and garden all vegetarian the cool in the head know if they are not in a Win-Win let me be very honest with you even I get angry but butArmenia and mental health is way better all the information the main body injuries long Tom and Jerry hall when is the Tennis elbow the wrist injuries all that gone again the science behind us we spoke about in the fit Tuber podcast and details who was that ok but the point of leaving me Tanav me again was to get to the next level I have this whole concept of living my life like an athlete to be more specific LeBron James who has always maintained this thing is life about every sceneadding one skill to skill set ok which we can become the ultimate basketball player in the worldI have to change so then things in my own life exact add more skills others so my way it is work on yourself and that was my life the answer is obvious that leave meet because lete one will open up the channels for more advanced yoga

to people are like being a fly on the wall and conversation it's beginning to be able to listen to educated and experienced people in this industry can you become a multi-millionaire if you get aggressive into the real estate space in India you can definitely become a multi-millionaire you can depending on what you do this episode is that it's notboring 1111 a lot about life and it can be a very brotherly conversation the person I have on Vishu today has been brother me something at 12 years old and I started beerbiceps a lot of the business lessons that we get from book so college I got from Mr justice rager 21 on the smartest brothers I have actually my real life learnt a lot about finance from you learnt a lot about different businesses from you u No 1 lesson I had early on in life I don't know whether my mum mytold me this was that always keeps in different new in this worldbasic financial education for say a 20 year old who is watching this podcast on lesson plan so firstly just introduces also working like what your family background when was the first case and how do we know how do we know each other so we know each other in school I was 13 when I saw this really had had to be at a guy like burst into my class everyone simple I know his wife already and since then we have been making pizza Sanjog for 13out sometimes when we get time but I studied in Canada in Toronto studied economics I came back to help out my family business in 2015 and I work in a bunch of different places since then I've worked in the Technology Sector I work in interior products which is like my Legacy family business and last three years of been concentrating on real estate real estate from a young mind I promise you that is the podcast for you and I know as much as you do as of now this is my 2angry boy down the basics very fast Mr why it when it comes to realise what are the abcs of what should you know what is real estate advisory by flats on you by physical property real estate is real physical assets by properties properties can be a flat it can be land candy shop any physical property as a that you are buying qualifies as real estate and then this is the basic there are more complicated versions and products but this is why you start with it sowhy do adults aged like overcapacity na please SMS karo is that safe investment if historically has been to be fair if the same think you know Indian Indian logic in this is conservative you have always been known for women jewellery in gold for people with businesses and real estate is seen as a long-term store of value any investment or making specifically real estate is to save Garden grow your money over the long term so you basically have some money extra can you do not allowed to stay in a bank accountFD Mausam iski like the stock market opening safe buy a house by a piece of land and hope that the value of that increases with time that has always been so in India legends vs Roti Kapda Makan that would you start with seen as a basic way of foundation on which to build your life as lekin TB ke marij don't house nai family ke liye works on those things about safety simo asset is inherently se obviously compared to buying a share in the equity market the stock marketthis is going to change value and movements low because it is a physical asset is going to be if the if the price of the property is actually going down you dear the spotted very fast Furious it is going over time it's very easy to buy something which is the ticket size of like you birthday today purchases you don't think so much but when you're going to be spending lakh rupees which is essentially allthen the amount of decision-making because the ticket size changes should really state has always been away for traditional Indian people to have a store of value is always been a way for them for security and now kind of things are changing causal estate markets are changing India's win a place where usually would assume in the past that you know you invest in land to Manga to hone wala wasn't considered a risky proposition at all things have changed but whilst it still remains of goods store of value for your money as and it's morelaughing and other investment at the door so does it make sense today for a young guy who got 1 crore rupees to buy house in Mumbai Delhi Bangalore Chennai I mean honestly the way the world is going in general it also affected real estate be called the gig economy what is happening so that means instead of buying something for good you rent it even when it comes to labour it comes to any resource you rented out for the time needed and the use you needed so slowly people young people especially a moving away from the concept ofare comfortable with renting because what happens a lot of times is that given release date in India for you know it's not enough not good face right now real estate market down while I Kasim black people who live in messenger money property ka rate has gone down so that I lost that is actually started happening right now especially especially in Mumbai I think in India only Bengaluru the only City doing well in Mumbai real estate prices are down especially the residential real estate is depressedmany houses that I think in Bombay the talking about lacks of unsold flats as Inventory of the money to buy it or not in the right market condition you know that if someone usually how realistic tends to work is as a builder I will not take some land taken loan from a bank is my finance and I will make a building and sell it usually there are also investors want to know like all the traditional Indian model of like you say investing in houses as not being ki banaa Banaya flat le liyawhat traditional older Indian people would say buy under construction cost in making the building I am going to give you money on the trust that will finish the building and then they hope keep jab tak ready ho jaega 3 to 4 years then you get a jump in the value of the property is appreciated that give you Mona 34 years ago but now given that the younger people don't want to hold so much capital One keep all this money secondly people at her age you are working to come by 1 crore rupees also is a bit proposition and Bombaythe kind of value you get for that road is not as much so people on more in tune to using that money somewhere else Ok celebrate that download live it basically we are young it difficult to get money in your pocket don't be not yet and also directly to a lot of young people think his hold up if I have se 5 lakh loan for startup Mutual Funds are doing ft which is actually the logical your money should work for you always you when you have Lego crore coming in every month and all is where you can think about is Bio 3 Crore flat if you have a croutedifferent position to the kind of information and people were access may be your decision making will be different but with you said something about what we say about Bombay right now Bombay real estate market especially residential is not doing well a great Sahab gone down sales are less people are trying to move inventory it's not a good time to buy a flat in Mumbai if a good time to buy the prices low so if you coming as a customer today OK what happens is that you have any command the price to a large degree because theyunsold building left and unsold flats left so for example there are two bedroom hall kitchen in Mumbai I know depends a lot on the area but they take Andheri west night very populated what people want I want the house that kind of the centre of the city now how much would of let there be two bedroom hall kitchen bedroom and 2 to 3 crores depending on the developer depending on the kind of locality because he Andheri East and West Andheri so was used and as a totally different organismsexpensive like recently so how are usually works is in generally all over the world the government provides low income housing in a lot of countries and premium housing and all the different segments so murder Maharashtra Housing Development Corporation pretty much they have they make their own flat on the oxygen them for people to get access to the housing and the auction flats made by the government I think the sentiment of 75 lakh rupees in in power and that was like the line is full the moment openespecially in a place like Bombay As a young person in your 20s how much I were you may be earning your likely going to have to take outside financing in the form of a home loan to buy a property and expensive and feel that in India because you and this is how we work as a society we are very respectful to other parents and elders and the mentality that we passed on is Roti Kapda Makan ko then you automatically put pressure on yourself to buy a house and it is genuinely feel that a lot of people are switching out of that and it will hold updon't back it right as much is because it obviously in India especially with to give a lot of details like respect to our elders times are changing market the changing today if I could take home loan am looking at an interest rate of 8 to 8.5 % from borrowing money I am paying 8.5 % per annum on top of it to buy this house instead if I find someone's flat at their own it I am paying rent I am pink 2% of the property's value so if the flats are of the samewho is a big difference in renting and buying and you can be paying EMI for for me suppose if I take on home loan home loan tenure as you can be locked in for a commitment of a longer they are renting a flat in your flexibility here to upgrade your lifestyle of doing better business is doing well and gradually increased and then the same thing if you want a flat flat Bechne also doesn't come is your mind the market that government fees to be paid when you make a transactionduty of this I want to ask you if your savings all that money and not buying a flat for a young person what a great investment options and also wanted one more thing you grant cardone the world's top financial influencers strongly believes in only renting out your homes and doesn't wish to buy property lot of people talk about that and all that money to save the what do you do it just another side before answer that so a lot everything about seeing the the gig economy in the sense that people don't even want to write office is now so the youth movement using in coapeople don't ok people on rent officers instead rent usually people use to buy your whole family business visa office be carried on my renting this now if you don't want to invest in something that you have money and baby real estate is not the right option for you you can look into investing in real estate agents in stuff so there's a new carnow in India at least it's a new concept called real estate investment trusts are it ok so what happens is today suppose I want to buy an office and I want to write about u u na na company to pay me right in Bombay in general from what I have seen six to eight percent returns other no for commercial properties by office of the shop I give it you I am making 8% on my money right but what happens is for me to be able to buy the shop what yesterday I am in mygive me a property for 10 lakh se do I have the time and effort to do all this come for the Telecom property so what happened this the new concept is they want to make a liquid they want to make it easy to convert this property into cash into something you can use I just as an investment not an actual gaya so Legend liquid measurement of something you can convert into cash just like this no tension no time lag liquid means like when it's kind of on in your bank accountright and I want to sell it and use the money to buy xyz thing right it will be a 2-3 months delay and appoint brokers or lenders that today 55 shares of the same value I want to sell it I call my broken the sale more liquid because the time taken to convert into cash is well or so to combat this problem of real estate being not liquid real estate investment trust 1 of whole bunch of properties office property is usually okindependent management group to run it and take that company in the listed on the stock market so what happens if I have less money I am buying into I am fine share your instead of buying a property and someone else is maintaining the property renting it out for me taking their management management even giving your cut 8 men Together by like one who is that were treated as an investment exactly what happens is a group of investors in the stock market will invest in this product and running it they willthe properties for you find your client's rent it out make sure you are getting a good return value investing with bulldozer becoming an angel investor for builder not that the things you usually the traditional Indian model was like I was saying older people would invest in under construction flat but it was started happening was listed as a bad reputation in India project in get done right people lost money when your people broke money or it's more than more complicated than that obviously there are going to be bad apples in any industry that were given but over your legalsearch changed over time the market situation has changed people spending by most people spending power is changed so what happens over your basically Bank security from that it's an independently Run company by someone who appointed to work for you as a shareholder the Builder is not is boss because I was independently listed on stock market why should I invest in this it versus a mutual fund of stock market for one thing like we talk about its eyes only on the amount of your ready to spend on whatever investment or acid5 your is very small compared to any other property in Bombay that you want to buy the smallest amount of investment required in arey it is about 1.5 Lakh rupees with 400 units at the time of blessing so technically I will be around that number but he 1.1 1.5 Lakh rupees in minimum investment which today as someone with 1.5 Lakh rupees write your getting a dividend from the stock what is dividend means it means that you are getting money paid back to you like as interest and from the company you on the stressesyah Pasand kharida uska aap interest 300 rupees and today so what happens in this is that giving the smallliquid right and beyond that you can catch out at any time you want that the main difference today I decided to sell you give it away and for all the transaction costs of all this property and everything that also is done by someone else are getting back to a single listed at 300 rupees and today live given the entire week incidence market has crashed but this is to 30% off from the time of listing in which is around your way for theyou will be recording this at the time of the coronavirus outbreak in Mumbai that have been volatile eating sensex rallied for a bit but in general Global markets have been bad so OBC in that way your expose the little more but what happens is that 1.5 Lakh rupees today for you is getting you access to the best builder Cup best property manager by a professional person which you can catch out of any time it helps clean upright to your I was talking about this relation had a bad reputation count is more security recently the government passed the real estate Regulation Act Maharashtra is think so Consumer Protection starting to come now so what happens in a try and make the ethical to make it safe for you as a consumer used to happen if anything goes wrong it's like no code jao how to combat this form to make a complaint to the Police Bula builder usernameif you are in that situation asamanjas ki you know you given to online dating nice light Nahin no you are limited options of where to go now there's a dedicated authority to solve this problem for you want to help you out so that we realise it is getting cleaned and What happens by a function of listing something on a stock market is called a public company for a reason all the numbers everything has to be completely transparent Suna if I have to provide you with transparency I need to give you a great product and I need to make sure everythingthere is no scope for me to do something underhanded because it going on a stock market and the property has to be perfect product for less money more liquid so this is a new thing with worldwide real estate investment trust for warehousing for commercial offices you think India's getting into this Global movement now how do you ensure that you don't get fooled like that you have your own research about you in that has helped a lot that I had a lot of specific lawssunao value of the customer didn't know much also you know I have told mesunao anyone comes to building the US for the paperwork will tell you kitne time mein complete hoga where are you give me a copy what's the file number all these things that are also consumer education is important in any industry and especially given an industry where you are putting your leg blood sweat tears live ki manager putting into one pot but Alaikum what is the protocol for someone who is listening to this item in western what is the first step is Demat account that have a demat account what you need to invest insecurity or any financial market in India have a demat account I would suggest obviously real estate investment trusts are specifically it like buying equity with the share buy or part of a company there are a lot more options for you start off with obviously currently in the market things are volatile but generally speaking as it is a neutral funds are the What people consider as beginner investments because you don't think so much in India also right now there's one it sogo ahead and investment was a good product and is doing well in the market prop something up and believes in its value in the good that what I believe it is only one so this is just starting in India so what happens is usually a developer who has always inventory right I am 820 building Mujhe then I Kisi Ko I want to make a transmitter listed on the stock market Shoaib a financial company use your private equity company ties up with the Builder so I think the current wheat was the embassy group based out ofthey have taken alone does not reflect the bankers name right now but basically a with a bank in the list this property of so it was that way and you will invest with the embassy share that with the trust of the right now and what do they doshareholders money used for marketing of the product marketing maintaining the products and every other explain the beautiful you got a new office space rent it out what happened to the property write a debate on rent to someone and Uske bad the leaf ran out of the market is bad the water was some problem happened your tenant leaves your left the place for 3 months which is empty 4 months is empty repair broken through the furniture all this incident will cause they will take care of and makes ok internet returnbothered with any of this if I have my own property I am micromanaging think ER paint karna FIR giving house on rentis very saree with the money raised on your favourite because my dad but you recently added to the last three for you been working on this one really say that I have not done Arya Logon the old-school way out of property and after long term investment family you parking lot of money in that property and rented out to corporate centre in that process so you like just run AVN through the whole story of what was your thinking about ok now we have all this money what dowhy did you choose real estate values that building what is the future projection think it again like you know it an old-school thing is when a Legacy things for my father he has been stabbed with real estate because I used to work in the interior product market is to supply to builders supply to Hotel flooring for decorating would all that cannot be started out there and his book for 37 years in that market Soya is he built up his connections to that and then eventually started investing that this is a different time we're talking about theinvesting in different properties by them for additional is the Motto companies so we work in the same vein for that usually taken of your own project and you're not buying the land and doing it it's a long process of professional staff combined with our nowadays you have to adhere to the laws and be beyond the straight and narrow so for us this project was the largest can be taken on which had been working on the commercial building and now we had bought it in a state where can you know it market was entrustedFrontline it's starting to become now at the Underworld involved it was more like things you know chalta hai kind of work like you see so many of these cans and real estate and It all happened because the environment was not transparent people could get away with the things needed to get away but I think they were complications and I came back and we started working on this project we have you know now reached by marketing and we want to get out that that's the traditional related business for bodybuildingand I will want to talk to people about the money and therefore that traditionally used to happen was team morale and ok Mujhe develop karna hai aap to start making a residential building what I tell my local trusted investors when you buy the flats building that you only get it all for you are the better it so they know ki you now that things are becoming the foreign real estate the newjoint venture into someone else's you don't have the capital development theek hai do an agreement with me I will develop the land will split whatever flat Summit you're an isolated ways of working people want to now given the market has become even more depressed now the there is a trend of suicide building societies Re developing their buildings on the Moon so there get a Consultant for it and What happens in old elaborated buildings that people have lived for your all the neighbours know each other It will be like instead of selling this lead and during summerThoda Thoda Paisa Daal Ke together will pitch in and we get the building meet again make a profit of it also depends on a lot of factors where you are what the cost of actually getting paying the sower boxes and municipal corporation is the one that grants for approval Sofa Sofa YouTube get the BMC approval is there are there like it processes have to go through with the lame and it's not easy to understand it took me a long time myKishan bhajan economics and political science from theoretical background into this but yes with a long process now these things because the transparency because it open people feel like the ones that count by someone market opening of different opportunities are coming in people are trying different thing doesn't make sense to invest in a smaller Indian city Lai Vi Vidisha what happens is that real estate markets especially in the inner city like Mumbai or even in Delhi without pocket Basa so I live in Andheri today suppose anyou have made a lot of money maybe you can afford to go live in Worli but your families in Andheri for your neighbours are there everyone you know is that it becomes what we call on Micromax ok so I may be just want to live only in Andheri I don't care about this because of thisblue Satin floor in Bombay to sell and it doesn't work out smaller cities on the other hand Tier 2 cities like your Nagpur is a good real estate market Bangalore has become as expanded so much that is still going as demand but Gurgaon in Gurgaon opened up people made a lot of money on the board flats about their land with this holding in smaller cities Ahmedabad the stila big city am talking like you know Baroda is a good exampleGoodwill estate market real estate hotspots in India but now so what it was here that banaa office now all new market again because the opportunity grouping data centres is certainly a big what is so any time you use a service like Instagram on scrolling on Instagram those images someone posting them ok but it goes you are connecting to serverosiya picture I was uploaded it goes to a server on my phone service data centres for all your data for sending messages on WhatsApp so all the servers need to run xampp not data centres the big Margaret now with the explosion of e-commerce everywhere warehousing is becoming a big market how to keep all the area outside of anything around because now if Amazonsame day delivery on something it means you have to have it close by and Happy Hour depot multiple depot close by to they can do so in this way you like Tier 2 cities Chandigarh Amritsar Chandigarh is plant people want to live their lives by the good real estate market markets depend on opportunity so final two questions of this podcast firstly other than Ari it I know that's that the king kind of move for people in our generation smart move right nowAnna change always market always change your like there was a time I think 10 years ago people assume that the US 2008 financial market crash little people thought that housing was a safe investment people would not default on a mortgages because that was an integral part of your life never pay back the home loan for home loan matlab if you feel thatreading it's obviously it's Complex financial trading on top of housing bank loans and Housing market crash so obviously these things can change but given the scenario today and given that in India Si I am talking about the real estate market in Mumbai now land acquisition in smaller areas especially for agricultural land and also it's complicated so in an urban environment you have money instead of buying a flat today in Mumbai nightpaath se Yuva to expand into small town interview specific right what would be your next moves like in real Amazon would you slide onto se Nagpur actually very interesting because the locality connection of you know Highways to the place to Nagaur has all that there's a big Expressway coming Mumbai Nagpur Expressway that going to come so I would think that residential not personally is not something I am interested in but warehousing is a huge market because E-Commerce p********** inTier 2 tier 3 India is only going to increase everyone has a demand for these products and services that will be delivered to the door which means that warehousing is going to be a big deal to you invest in these very good now I think first markets have to normalise a little bit that liquidity that we spoke about you know people should be able to cash out or an asset for other things to move until that happens things will be talking about this coronavirus situation coronavirus situationreal estate markets Bond good in Bombay before the coronavirus situation like that has made things a little worse because people do not who is going to Lucknow by talking about working from home right so office space demand is going to go down this type of things are looking to venture out into other places are looking at connectivity mainly like a lot of people have been waiting for very long for Alibaug to get better connectivity with cherries and search currently no all your answer is not is a big deal for Alibaugyou see that where people at what people think about the future where is this country going what kind of services are there and which of these services will require land and land based applications so what would be your next move that you invest in small town India as a Gai photo commercial and warehousing Bandhan bank is there other than Nagpur training centres you like locked on Baroda Chandigarh Chandigarh think Bengalururunning quite well regardless of what the scenario is your Nagpur writing is a big one because that Highways coming apart from that there is Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor so long that there's been a lot with this is the road that goes from Mumbai to Delhi writing along the road and railway line also which in with interconnects so is a direct route for goods from Delhi to Mumbai along that is a typically you look at these types of things I was connectivity and access on strategic points like CAaur Pune for example write usually most of the rising demand of Pune satisfied by Mumbai market there but maybe not as much as peopleNoddy sometimes just listening to what happens if you get everyone for people liked reading on the specific market the standard dialogue when any uncle comes in a meeting per chai Pee Lene Laga market so that it start your own what's going on what happening are the order is going through is the demand for x or y the greatest but it's beginning to be able to listen to educated and experience people in this industry can you becomemulti millionaire if you get aggressive into the real estate sales in India lot to do in the realistic space like you can you can obviously the upside is there because it's a huge market but there are also a lot of people that can definitely become a multi-millionaire you can depending on what you see if they decide to mujhe building banani hai there are certain barriers to entry level called in Economics ok so it's ki there are certain prerequisites to aapko karne padenge to for your actually able to make that like Kinect sensorland kharidne ke liye paise chahie Honge to get things approval

today's episode of the Ranveer show India's mostvalue-adding contest Bikaner recommend a top 5 shows that you can watch online right now that will add some kind of value your life gladly assist your mind firstly it to show that I recommend above anything as a fictional show this kind of affection Midas square black mirror Ashok Bansal must watch this and for those of you who haven't it's about humans in the near future so that I say 10-20 years from nowis a big factor in that show it talks about how Technology can become so advance it can become an integral part of human life for example may be will be able to install chips in a head which record everything we see through our actual ise kind of like the Snapchat goggles but you know contact lens style for example maybe someone will be able to take all the consciousness all the Intelligence and put it entirely inside of video game orall reality world Meri Bill passed away but even after passing away the Intelligence and the consciousness the soul in we put inside a computer system the sum of the plot lines that you see on black mirror one of the shows that is very entrepreneurial almost feel that if you are a young Businessman you're looking for the next Big Idea this show will get your mind to think in that direction it will get your mind expand the little bit that I love about this show every time we watched an episodechallenges challenges how you think of the world challenges what you think of machine the challenges what you think of Technology and honestly feel that your mind is molded because of external forces a week early life experiences on this can be someone else's vacco Minds ideas imprinted on to your mind the flywheel and black mirror is one of those shows that really message with your head but it open of your head in many places that you didn't expect to be opened ok so number 2called Silicon Valley show about startups again I am an entrepreneur I love shows like that I love shows that teach me something is too big reason that lead to watches show firstly the fact that it teaches you business through a fictional show it shows you the life of young entrepreneurs water takes to grow big what it takes to become rich what it takes to run a multi-million dollar company all the challenges involved and it was really funny show so it's infotainment packaged as a funsectional show you learn a lot from the show their young entrepreneur you can a lot of inspiration from it but the second reason I want to watch this show is because it's about losers just give me everyone on the inside somewhere kind of looks down then selected but I don't think we are heroes we don't think they motivational speaker somewhere we looked down on ourselves a little bit this is a story about losers just like that you actually make it really big through honest hard workwhite inspiring very relatable every single person who watches the show will find a piece of themselves inside that show ok so number 3 is called Cosmos hosted by one Neil degrasse Tyson I don't know you pronounce the surname but it's basically Osho about the universe just have black mirror challenges your mind in terms of Technology this one challenges your mind based on Mathematics Physics and passed science discoveries is not a fictional showNeil degrasse Tyson actually takes you through Revolutionary movements in human history say when we discovered that the Earth revolves around the Sun or se when the first telescope was invented what the human story was at that point is a beautifully made sure the cartoon call family that made by someone quotes that Matwale Nav grown up watching family that was a big part of my creative education and life that same guy has been an executive producer on the settings created thesome of the best graphics that you'll ever witness in any kind of series this is the show I highly recommend if you're looking for something extremely heavy to watch it's such a heavy show that you won't be able to watch more than one episode per night it's just too much information to soak in for example I remember there was one episode when Neil degrasse Tyson is trying to explain the quantum world which is the world of atoms so this is the world you and me know the physical worldis about this ise your and my size of physical laws are based on Newton's laws like gravity like every action has an equal and opposite reaction but once you would reduce the size of yourself to the size of atoms the laws of Physics change the way gravity is changed everything in that Quantum world completely changes on this one and I episode that takes you through the quantum world is one entire episode actually even takes you through a black hole what it must be likepassing through a black hole how Neil degrasse Tyson actually travels to the black hole every comes out on the other side is a new dimension with new colours so think of all the colours you know think of red yellow pink purple now I think of a colour that doesn't exist yet what makes you think that all the colours you see the only colours that exist Cosmos talks about concepts like that what that next colour could be that hard unlockmind anyway show number 4 on the March lighter side is called Entourage so so I grew up watching it's about a Hollywood star who basically has come up from humble beginnings and is brought close friends and family with him from New York to and you're just and make it big in Hollywood it at that point in his life and things are just starting a go well known as the show progress as you see his rise in the world of Hollywoodcore aspect of the show the core aspect of the show is friendship and good times not grow up as a teenager watching the show The Lord of drugs alcohol sex in this one was also one of the funniest shows will watch it one of the shows that really kind of plant the seed of ambition in your life I remember as someone in one this school project ask me what I won't be doing at 25 and I said I want to life like the one the show in Entourage as a jokeI thought that three not possible the word on trash means a group

something went wrong so wonderful India so many opportunitieswhen we were kids Mr Amish Tripathi of you with Mr Vishal Gondaland so my my my whole impression about you before that podcast was that you are a great fiction writer and it is opened up my mind to your mind that I thought that man I should be starting my own podcast and having a party on it so Ithat what does a lot of my listeners haven't so some weight will be kind of sections are overlapped with that particular one I want to begin by going back to our childhood so I want to ask you about your family is dinner conversations with that was a key takeaway for me from that podcast he goes on a little at least a part of your character today shaped up kind of aspects of Eukaryotic and the conditions also an inspiration for a lot for books so goodstickers back to that worldchildren's bedroom 2 WhatsApp parents tell them to do you end up doing what you see your parents doing so if your parents as my parents didn't know we

directory later she became and call Ila in my journalwhat I like about your school of thought is that there are a lot of so-called mythology of Indian history experts out there but I can I understand a Lil bit of mythology in Indian history myself but when I listen to what they say I feel like their kind of putting forth their agenda when I listen to what you say I feel like you're putting out knowledge wisdom you know things that you've applied to yourself and you cannot tested out and then your putting out putting out there for the publicI'm why did you not write these books are the start of your career why did you take up regular career at the start and what happened what cause that's which you live in an awesome India where you live in India where you can be you can make videos on

courage there is no shortage in India is problem is in fightingjustified in fact I have a lot of questions about King Sohail there for you but I just wanna rewind a little bit I want to ask you that pre 11th century what was the actual strength of India why did we beat people that is he was it just the money exuberates Soviet bigger Armies was it strategy was it brains how did we beat everyone is a combination of everything we were like thiswe had the greatest universities anywhere in the world people think Oxford Cambridge are the oldest University of Cambridge as a 600 years ago the oldest university in the world was Takshila Indian subcontinent half 2600 years before the invasions begin the torque in visions we would have had at least maybe 2213 message universities of theok 5000-10000 tools Nalanda Takshila Vikramshila mahodayapuram Madurai schools in a small village on temples is too kind of developers schools and also Dharamshala for people we had you knowancient times in a printing press sweet handwritten manuscripts ok and if you see the number of handwritten manuscripts of ancient culture give you an idea of the knowledge production of that culture you know is the mother culture of your so Greece has some twenty to thirty thousand handwritten manuscripts surviving today 20 to 30 mother culture of your get how many handwritten Sanskrit manuscriptstoday what has been tabulated by the national mission for manuscripts they probably many more but guess how many happened tabulated by the national mission for manuscripts Greece mother culture of your 22 30,000 yes I would like I would like to say hopefully 50000 around for hire a lakh ok 5 lacsI Series 15 lakh 3 million it is more than the rest of the ancient world combined combined Lokesh maths physics chemistry knowledge seekers and scientists of ancient world we were extremely liberal women would be Warriors women could be rulersvery labour we were the greatest leaders of the ancient ancient world we keep your in of the Silk route write what is the Silk route Road per travel rupee how much for reading unit ships that Indian ocean is the only ocean in the world with the wind change direction because of the monsoon winds that like clockwork in the in the winter seasonfrom North East south west in the summer months in Southwest to Northeast which means you could do 13 February or across the Indian Ocean and other heart of the Indian Ocean is India the centre of global trade were controlled Indian ocean control Global trade emperor was passing of Rome had band trade with India because room was going bankrupt important things from India and Indian 118 from Rome was that we are so much gold in India why does India have so much goldgoldmines samajh good is because of traits of process centuries of freight services for which people who pay us in gold or silver what is line and one of the problems that I have do in those who explore our history there are some idiot so don't want to explore our history at all that well as we were we were in country British human civilizationpeople who is who will keep obsessing over the past and not focusing on the future is also was frankly we can say today yes our ancestors were Kickass their chief message vi Salam ne kya kiya hai what we achieved in the right what what should we think of the boss we should be worthy of our ancestors know if you know landthe most influential was powerful and the world we should we we should be we should be doing the same thing so I did ancient past to be like the fuel to driver future to driver confident that we should do rather than getting lost in ancient Paas Aaye Ham itne great aaj kya hal Ho Gaya Hamara and keep believing you know that talks ki blaming the Britishwe should speak the truth of it I agree to stupid hone se kya fayda on a person so there have been to moments in my recent past which really cannot invoke another angle inside me the first moment was in Engineering college when most of my friends would say things like why do you want to live in this country is the shit hole let's leave and go abroad then now they've all kind of left USAthe parents are alone that one aspect of it I also feel that I travel to Greece three years ago and this great guy was telling me about how the economic situation this horrible but all greeks believed that if your house on fire you don't run away from it you try putting out the fire now that I know many go back to those engineering students have a lot of that kind of everyday Council of India and are coming back but I personally feel like Indian heading into a good time but one moment mango thismoment of anger is probably recently after become a youtuber and become semi famous I feel that you can be conscious of social media when your jobs on social media so I do not like people do not just crying on social media I feel like I also give solutions but no one does that any more and people in school to just criticize and leave the criticism of that and often the critics are the least ambitious ones that also I can think of noticeVuitton Borse many days is this is brilliant American president Kaun Teddy Roosevelt and he did this poem of that the only one who truly matters is the man in the arena was finally whose he will fail only because it tries no antiseptics Kathaok and the only way you can avoid Failure is if you do nothing it was just another who does an experience when you are in 2050how do you think will be I think we have to screw up really badly I don't think we will have to screw up really badly to not be a superpower but I just too sure Momentum will carry us I think will either be the second largest of the largest economy in the world I think only display thatstorm in the world we can fight what's what is happening at the border and no I am not on random people on Twitter of giving advice is like the same to same People cricket expert Suno 1 year ago and were medical experts month back across Ali become Army Expressand leave it to the experts to do what they know best if a bus I am I am I am technologically very channel 45 years old I find it very difficult I am trying my best to learn ok but I will bea superpower by 2050 writing the question for us what kind of superpower will be be be like another country which we I am a diplomat why can't it banaa the country which we know is an authoritarian Park which is exporting diseases for the entire world which is which is using the Chaos caused by Joan disease which is exported to the world to try and Conquer other parts of the worldplease misusing tree tree 30 to 45 I'm not to just keep money found that kind of our ought to be the kind of power superpower that we were in the first Millennium common era where we never sent an army of broad audience more than 50% of the world in denying them just because it sounds so good and attractive ok we never only once we sent an army outside Indian commentators Raja Cholaautonomy to conquer in position traders and intellectual recent winner storytellers Wilson YouTube us but we will be influenced the world to attraction not through force in VB that kind of superba that's a conversation I think those of us were in the public space like you and I that's a conversation if we can drive identity but for us to tellDr me post this what you should be doing for us to tell The Economist was this you should be done automatically and when your busy you automatically respectful of other professionals with all the non non non ambitious people who kind of I just looking for opportunities to this27 only those who actually do a job know how difficult it is to do a jobdifficult to respect those who have made it on the home to you were talking about how he didn't say these words but this is the Vibe I got which is that whatever your strengths and if possible if your strength is that polished right kind of exporting it to the world and make your India great again in your own little way if I do believe your your doing that you a bookdefinitely trying to do it through my pot Kas all the books were written actually a now now I am also writing my Facebook which have been riding for three years now why completely relay it is about health and health autobiography struggling I am not allowed questions after this I will they genuinely your any way that I can help meAnu Pasand I really appreciated but I gotta ask you bro questions about the book includes a first book and I'm seeing how difficult it is a creative process nothing like creating YouTube videos of articles will have to put so much emotion into the book which is exactly my question to you I feel that this really cool Coat that said that the three basic needs of human of food shelter and storytelling so I know that you are kind of person who has these ideas and opinions thatabout the video wrapping it up into your storytelling and N2 publishing it for the world so so basically so that one thing I definitely want to ask you want to expand on that the second concept I wanna ask you about when it comes to writing is that again this is something I picked up from your Vishal Gondal podcast you said that you are just a channel for creativity to expresses itself for divine creativity to express herself so that we will never get againschool book update School YouTube video any creativity doesn't really belong to you that something that can I change the lot of things in mind that while the podcast was that impactful in my life but could you expand on this whole writing process for yourself and also did you think of the money aspect of things when you are starting out so wonderful you say that story is a one of our essential needs this brilliantcall musical direction so that the universe is made up of atoms it's actually made up of stories and what we absorb you are essentially story love the as a species story loving people and you'll find that even education works best when it's in the form of a story why does our present education system was it sucks to be honest and why does it seem so much are presentsystem is essentially a derivative of what was the pressure on education system was properly modern Germany was basically about 1 standard syllabus No 1 teacher 50 students selected for the entire thing was somehow create a quickly scalar and create a bunch of class basic is India's education systemPathshala the attitude is very different teacher student ratio B 12526 was to create thinkers so which is why this to trying to reach through stories so for example like till what till what age did you study Maths 10th standard 12 standard Amman engineering all my life 22subject education system fitting killed the foundational takes for a gurukuls formats used to be the text call Leelavathi which was written by a Rishi code bhaskaracharya is from what was Karnataka 1239 why is it called Leelavathi because his daughter whose name was Lilavati hated mathematics to watch the text for her to make a love mathematicsok I need it in the form of Sanskrit poems that you enjoy without realising it by the end of the poem an axlefirst time I heard the section West to carry the story that the Ramayana story just sugriv sends his people to go find Pitamah ok because Lord Rama Instagram and in the text it has been described as to grieve tell his people do when you was south then this month I will come then this review will come then this will come that Income that this will come then I'll be there with the see them with the silent flowerthis month income this will come this Kingdom is come then the sea will come then they describe up to Bali Indonesia OK then he was described not up to the Himalaya beyond any describe the waist and I remember this is the 7th standardGeography lesson in the story to describe so much in detail in geography in the form of a story or in Mahabharat Vidur Niti is basically of governance in the group of a story is a civics and law lesson in the storyand I tried to my stories as well you got a score on their philosophy that I feel very deeply right there are those that are there in the surface level my dues on women's rights my dues on LGBT rights those are you know the service level they walked into my books like the heart of the Shiva Trilogy is an exploration into a philosophy that what is youheart of the Ram Chandra series is an expression into the philosophy what is an ideal society ok Indian Idol Bate issues and that in the story like like one debate in ramrajya in ideal society is ideal society that should you follow law should you follow justice sometimes a tour and conflict would you do that ok like that many people when that would seek rape case that happened in Delhimany people saying chaurahe per sense of Justicethis has shown the gap of a story as a debate between Lord Rama not Bharat Lord Bharat says the loss of the cause of justice it was not so in the cause of justice I will break the lawand sometimes may be the log not work but overall society will be in a better place what is the right answer I don't know I just put up this give it a try and put them across in the story because then it doesn't provide reading a story about democracy so what we think our politicians will be forced to sing tomorrow100% I feel the universal X it writers once every 1000 years or so so when create and creativity has chosen due to operate out there so that's that the question to ask you so like honesty for me that podcast was kind of a turning point in my thought process who told you about this creativity is divinity expressing itself as you and your words who put that Idea on your headthis was actually something that our ancestors believed that they followed the throughout their associated have noticed that are ancient paintings in Chinese culture as it does not have the signature of the of the artistic notice that only that often the only now that you have to do itthe artist in have to worry about the role she check the society to care of them because society thought it was a duty to take care of them all in all I think I should get it done not based on thenew notice most of our stories most of our most famous sculptures are all around the divine figures are rolled around a Gods and Goddesses Sonu strike we never get bored of sharing their stories you want to keep your in it in different ways I think this is one of the reasons we are one of the few ancient culture that is alive till today we are so deeply attached to a storiesyou know MS Roma submit Gaye Jahan se ab tak Magar Hai Baki Naam O Nishan Hamara Kuchh baat hai ki Hasti Mitti nahi Hamari Sabhi Aaye ToRaju Seth rightly stories define acid defines anyone's culture and the fact that story is revolved around the Gods and Goddesses is what I think makes us to attach to the Ramayan vazhi telecast right just a few months back its retelecast of 30 35 year old TV series read even at that time the production callaaj ke Jamane ke Madhyam se AVN from the parameters of the day even then it got a higher than Game of Thrones did worldwide of Thrones got all over the worldstories stories teachers think when I reference mythology on my YouTube channels one of the common kind of Rolls anyone coming and the reaction that get from trolls and for the lack of a better word haters if it's not mythology is the history how dare you called mythology so this is something I didn't understand as an urban Indian kid because I am not saying that's not hisis the referencing those stories with the word mythology what is this why are people so sensitive about it being a history was it being called mythology was it not been proven I don't understand this explain this to me in some ways we are reacting to the like the British told us know that theyreligion is history which true but not to let the British told as so many Indians believe today also that India was not a country the British created is for us because no identity columnit says that knows of the ocean south of the Himalaya is the Nobel Nation Varsha Global Nation call Bharat and their live the descendants of Bharti describes the Indian subcontinent and it says this is where the descendants of Bharat live this land is Rs 2,000 years ago a cause every Nation was UK wasn't a nation that time India was initiallyno more than 300 years ago but we don't know I history so somewhere in our Instinct we react to the British Raj and sons against us and we feel it as insults but because we don't have knowledge we don't know how to argue against it from a polite perspective Sobi reactive than there so I think that this comes from the word mythology and history live even told mythology is not truth2000 and sisters used to say there's only one line one subject which can claim approved fruits that subject is mathematics no other subject and play Mysore to it's all relative fruit In theoretical physics is accepting that are you an engineer you'll understand this you're theoretical physics is understand is accepting that are observer bias defines a food that is Cmultiple universes and wherein the universe that are observer bias has accepted his ancestors no photo was this silly flight 65 ki my truth is the one prove otherwise go to hell if you don't believe in this place is my truth ok so I think a lot ofthis because of British raj insults and because we have not updated our education system not learnt enough of our ancestors the British East Indians are Anmol culture they were used to write Bulshit Boss 3 million manuscripts more than the rest of the World Mumbaisitting but we don't know how to answer back so period and because we have knowledge that we can do what do you mean mythology history there is no one truth Sushil Winston Churchill is a great man for the British understand he defended them from the energies understandable but forWinston Churchill was even worse than it was he killed 3 million Indians in a manner that you order ki auditing that is more than the number of that is almost as much as the number of Jews that Hitler killed Hitler didn't feel any instance was what Winston Churchill 3 million Indians in a man-made family that he ordered so what is the historical truth is messenger chalo Monster was then it or is your great patriot it depends on the perspective of the British years agoHitlerYeh Vasanth business loan perspectives of other people absorb it and then kind of make peace with what everyone please be strong and ask youwhat is the truth behind the Mahabharata war and the Ramayan war actually happening did it happen when the kings were fighting each other in human history if it did happen in what your did it happenlike many modern British today only King Arthur did exist ok Alpha or beta the elder access at there isn't that mistake celebrities and a lot of their stories but there is a lot of food that I think this we have researched it enough to prove it but lineagesone one aspect of it that can be used to configure updates for example so you know the earth It rotates and rewards that had been taught in history badhiya Yuva Cena top rotating a topthat ok it does not rotate on its Axis actually it keeps Shivling like this it was such that the exact point on earth comes back to its original position every 26000 years it was like that while rotating ok every 26000 years because the Earth rotates like this again you're an engineer will understand the sky also changes of perspective changesthe the the the phenomenon of where the earth was like this and the sky Chini that is called procession ok now there is there are heavy duty softwares for this which can calculate that when would the sky actually have pin like that because of procession you can print it when the sky would have been in that Naksha from thatwhat's the English word for it in a configuration in the constellation sorry in those positions because the it's like if a sky has been described today the only time the sky will be exactly the same will be exactly 26000 years later or exactly 26000 years earlier because the earth towards the sky has been describedwrite a few times in the Ramayana Mahabharata in the birth of Lord Ram for example when the Mahabharata war started for example you can take that into a software and get the precise date when it would happen ok this has been used to date when perhaps the what would happen if we get some days I view some interpretation of those days in my books in the seriesstudied enough by Scholars more frankly not ok indian universities will be shocked most of them don't even have a sanskrit department you know this people who have there are more sanskrit department abroad in India is easier to study Arabic of Persian history in India then Sanskrit history people who historians who written several books history books that we studyRomila Thapar books which your study study study translatedis Scholars today to study those recordspopular start teaching Sanskrit using Queen Elizabeth is going to come to Jantar Mantar and 2009 the how can I do this how can I change the education system that the British Raj photo it specifically with the walls is there like if you go to Kurukshetra can you actually find some proof because I remember reading this thing as a kid where people said that they found some kind of proof of some kind of nuclearradioactivity in the Kurukshetra area so you have any knowledge about that I honestly don't know else to say that and I am I see you again that Scholars need to study to be done like there was for example we get being told that Indus Valley did not have a strong chariots and so-called Aryans camethe Indus valley people who went out and bought she was a dark skin God and Lord Rama Lord Krishna the Aryan Gods screen now there are many things which in the text only Lord Krishna Lord Rama dark skin Boss Christmas means to ask if they found what looks like a warriorshareit which is design satyadev in full by horse and it has been dated to minimum 2000 BCA which is the time of the Indus valley civilization is there is research which is which which need to be studied by unbiased Scholars not from the left wing and right wing extremist types and by Scholars and give the food wastecoronavirus Oracle Graham Hancock which would have been above sea level only 10 at the10,000 years ago I started I don't know the answer is to be studied by Scholars have been mentioned as a worldwide phenomenon and even history of you can see it wasevidence to show that are in our ancestors understood some form of vaccination is well so that was probably a form of smallpox vaccination injection there are some Ayurvedic to explore it is one thing and I am not the shop for now going back to Spanish Logon back every India has never been a source of a pending notice that it is thereother countries and space is a country which is exported this specific virus Corona has been a source of pandemics repeatedly India has never been a sweet winner Safa of pandemics created in other countries but we have almost never I can be college in the recent past 100 200 years there has been a source of a pendant ok this is to be studied bydoes his health has is a raw food habits better know what what needs to be because they could be lessons for the wall of the house in India is is very densely populated this is one of the key factors in the rise of endemics densely populated cities are much more effective than rural areas is dense population the disease spread quicklyhow come India has never been a source of a pandemic history study of Nostradamus was a historical figure who predicted the future that in the same way did we have some kind of figure like that in India who predicted the coronavirus situation or just general in Indian history have we had a Nostradamus if you read Nostradamus is therepredictive and I understand that there isn't something to Astrology for traditional I don't I don't call it was the way I see it happens in your life is a combination of 26 what happens to you and how you react to what happens to ok no control over what happens because of the coronavirus pandemic which were exported to the entire world fromstock control over how we read to it is up to us about predictions and astrology with remote control over its focus on what we can do people in that negative binomialtrue is your own attitude you see people who go to the traffic situation will fight it true and so many people believe that business is just like people have and I feel like there are a lot of businesses that have taken a hit during the coronavirus situation and I also strongly believe that as far as my understandingyogic things go that the world needs this Karmic cleansing processes once every hundred years or so and this from my observation and seeing a lot of the business is a factor of probably the ones that adding to the worldwide pollution the worldwide Europe maybe Nasha like Zayn Malik fuelling peoples physical urges think those businesses have been affected does does yoga the Vedas say anything about this current situationKarma cleansing happen once every hundred use member at the heart of the Indian way is it about justice is about balance and it's not about justice from the human perspective explain this in the Corona situation that the last this philosophy the Corona situation last four months have been terrible for human beings but it has been probably among the best in living memorymother nature for animals for rivers for plants are saying that the divine things only about human beings are not about other creatures correct so in the Indian perspective remember therma is actually about balance ok and sometimes justice is in balance sometimes justice is not in in balance in balance like week human beings may be sufferinganimals rivers plants they are benefiting to be conceived as humans beings ke sath injustice why it is the way balance gets destroyed because otherwise what can balance human beings call to login balance balance is coming back to us that one of the things that ancestors used to teach us had always live in balance which means Aisa Kahan are you knowwe worship with it was always Dharmik was not a Dharmik with that money only for yourbest money one is by giving Charity to the unworthy second by not giving Charity to the body which meant that in your given Charity also use your mind like if you are going and giving Charity to someone who is a drug addict in a given him money are you doing that money gowho is an Orphan was nothing and helping him educate yourself that's Dharmik it is about balance PC from this perspective and justice for human beings so many human beings have done wrong are also suffering is that injustice possible years but it's the earth finding balance again and if you do believe in the theory of past lives you never know you know who is killing of what kind of Karmawhen I want to put Mike Mike Tyson and he said that be humble in this life or else life will be store humbleness upon you and I see all of that happening around me with the coronavirus situation but anyway my last two questions of this podcast doesn't show will do many more in the future but the first question is about this book next to me suheldev so now what is the emotion you've written this book with what you're trying to tell the Indian youthsuheldev Limited explain what this is about the way history stop to us is that mamu Gajni came in the 10-20 attack India some 17 times and almost seamlessly after that Muhammad Ghori came and destroyed and and so-called Islamic rule we can you understand by using so-called Islamic rules to sach lete ok Colonial rule from the British Colonial rule Christian rules why do we call Turkey coronavirus Indian versus water parkit was talking to people who look like Ranbir Singh of Prithviraj Kapoor look but came in 10 and 11 and that was a time when the top of the worldcome back to India for hundred sixty years the answer is is King twelfth ok he put an army together and he killed the topic Invaders to the last man to the last war ok ok and the devastation was so deepwhat we call the point in those days Pata first used so that it was so devastating the terms in comeback for over 150 years and I think Kingsway their story is particularly relevant today because what does Kingsville their story signify when we Indians are United we are undefeatable no one can defeat as we can kick anyone's as okwhen you start fighting teacher OK when we started fighting why did the British Congress why did the why did the two clocks conquer why did the table what we callwhen we have 4 stars were trying to invade attacking all soldiers this is not the time for in fighting with the time for all of us to be united to be together across things while They brought out what together Army across regions across Khas across social standing near Hindu vs Muslim Buddhist in his Army had a backward casteyah people from all regions ok United army and we we gave the among the most devastating blows to the turks were the superpower of that time the world that message of kings who is very relevant right now we must be united I love you through your messages again that thought once again so but I'll tell you I mean I don't knowproper representative of my entire generation but my observation is that everyone my really doesn't have much of a religious divide kind of mentality announced its have never looked at a Muslim or Christian friend of mine and thought many differently than Hindu friend of mine and and I agree with you completely and my final question to you so again this is a selfish question is not for the podcast listener is just for mefirst book ever written about eight times and in a black gone over it times and every time I see if I can add more sometimes I remove the aggression from a 2-3 years was much more aggressive a guy and I really kind of want to put out something extremely perfect and intuitively internally I am feeling like I'm on the right track right now writing my book at the same time I also integrally know that once his first book is released the next few books are gonna come out rapidly am still kindgetting my book virginity if you want to call it that so you a first time writer I want to genuinely become se the next college JK Rowling but in that country in Hindi Amish Tripathi JK Rowling you know Radhakrishnan Pillai kind of league is reading would be relevant 20 years from now and what is your advice to me in terms of my own procedure of writingit's a health Facebook weather fictional affection so it's a nonfiction so is a story on my own life I went from obesity to becoming a fitness blog so it's the story along with like health Gyan like throughout the book is this place in Amrendra to storytelling but package informationyou can consume a story to a book you can consumer story show podcast you can consume a story web series story through a movie which all about consuming a story and what are the things I've seen is that those who were good story tellers ok if the most honest with themselves they can explain when it comes to ok was not something that you can learn you can onlynon technical skills you cannot Mats but how to communicate a good story was a blessing it just comes and I've always believed that if you aren't because there is no learning in storytelling is a synthetic like why do you know that you can just guided composition this way you don't even analysis which is not thisanalysis can be done of camera angles of things which technical things which can be learnt story telling you just know instincts to have a ok and I believe story tells a story that is different forms like if you are a sure if you are communicating your stories to ago I need to learn language to learn you know if I want to be a youtuberin which for me a very difficult that camera angle you Hona chahie a sound backup on it is this right nowyour story teller already you had the distinct that you can't explain yourself how you know that to be taken in this direction is not correct position to have a storytelling net within you is a different form of the same that can be taken into web seriesyou need to learn the technical skills of course you need to learn technical skillsgood for India and you can do a lot more good for India generally any way I can help in a book from one Chosen One to another and was the first of many conversation over the your so thank you again so"

in the country that has impactful as the Industry that we call Bollywood Indian films dedicating entire life to one industries studying in Inside Out every single week every single day Actually that's Rajeev Masand for you also super articulate guide you can talk about his thoughts really well but of course the Ranveer show and talking about Bollywood will not just talking about the business of Bollywood also talking about the bottom side of Bollywood The Dark Side of Bollywoodpromise you it all from an intellectual perspective yes gossip darkness and intellectual conversation can be put in the same 30 minutes or so I hope you enjoy this 30 minute podcast with one of the most learnt man welcome to the world of modern Bollywood Rajeev Masand lot to learn in this podcastcan be sure the smart intellectual articulate regard all the word personified Mr Rajeev Masand promise is taking namehas recently spoken about this on the film by by pointing to historical inaccuracies in the film and and the coast and the and the the producer actress very madam ok I know that a certain actress who was trying to avoid her ex at a certain event was only half successful because they were in the room at the same time it got awkward becauseactor was with family ok and one more problem problem that I was really looking forward to it out but there is a huge financial problem that they might be because you are from this industry is your job to study the industrial chemistrynew watch Shahrukh Khan done wrong in the last five years I think he became am I think I think he has taken 200 huge risk it came from a place of trying something really brave and was extraordinary in terms of what he wanted to put his bill unable to to to to shake off is play Shahrukh Khan over and over again even his placeis not playing that blow his playing Shahrukh the the other person is bliing Shahrukh the on the socially awkward whatever information which is why Insan for me the character that stood out was actually the two star width of the battery played really interesting and he was playing a version of himself but but that was really blessed because because he was playing him that he was playing him as someone who's who of dancers at wedding for money who's who is not all the BC and onboardingwhat is the real movie star so I think the problem is that he needs to completely let go of Shahrukh Khan and ARM and is a fine actor there I think you need to work with directors who are not overwhelmed by him I think he needs to let go of control and I think that's very hard winner of superstar because you really do understand the business and you understand your fans and you think you understand what the world wants better than even your filmmakers and I think the only way to completely submit is to give uptrust filmmaker trust story and said I like to say that won't do it is done that but very nice story but he will come in US as producer in take charge of a lot of things don't let let it be another as aesthetic let it be issued in circles it is said to be in the reasons that it allows too much of Shahrukh to creeping but I still think that he is the bravest of the model is taking more leads and and and and he is taking more chances and then must be the most charming of them all so that Ionly flop films from here on he still gonna be loved and respected by the with themI felt like the most important person in his life and that is exactly the quality the Shahrukh has been there with you in German 100 weight men Like A Mirror by the time your with your turn to you going to meeting you in the future for as a pastor your exhausted but that half hour one other use majak you walk out feel like the most important person in his life in the world with their really know how to make you feel good they will be really know how to talk to peoplewhy be happy in during the boot space of youth junction Tom Cruise career weapons didn't work we didn't have a major religions but he still considered one of the biggest superstar in the world because of that during a quality he had even if you don't work you don't forget him is a huge impact on the cultural footprint really as Shahrukh right I also want to ask you a Lil bit about the business of Bollywood nonstop actors AVN becoming a producerwhat are the audiences don't know if that happens a lot of business is outside of films as well so kind of this very fast break down the whole revenue stream model of all actors about having a modern day onbut I don't want to do that one film in three years than 1.2 years and we get pain is not is not considered to what you could be making give you doing other things I think the make all the money the real money comes from other things you do if you remember meeting its origin broking names Ryan Reynolds no I am a meeting Ryan Reynolds when when when visiting Deadpool and he said you make movies full love you get paid for the marketing and there they promoting is the right that the parties only enjoy it and I think that's trueBollywood stars is the ads experiences of its other businesses and each of them have a multiple business are you familiar with who has what I have to say no I don't I am not a mean Shahrukh Khan cause a production company but I am sure that one other businesses and for the role heavily invested in in in real estate and show the we have no at the joke but Akshay Kumar is to be that will you walk in Toronto and Akshay Kumar on half of Toronto so much property but but I am not have to say a very honestly I called upno of some letter no Abhishek as a stake in a winner in sports company and know that it has also has a wedding planning business so she is am are all recognise that you need to be entrepreneurs outside the film business because a sofa kal and landscape changes so quickly and because of you want to do it funny how quality work is inversely proportional to actually income so if you really want to spend your time making movies with love in one spend your time to telling full movies in 1881 film in two years then good luck the money is notlook at it is there guest 45 crossing the colour of money but I don't haveRatan Dhan Payo a lot of an adress mental health issues in Bollywood flying around the people don't claim to understand but it is ondepression Reddit interview and reading and I could relate to a lot of the symptoms cause I don't think of myself as someone who is depressed of who has mental issues mental health issues what if life not the stakes at movie stars 2 can relate the symptoms can you imagine what what some of these big big stars are dealing with everyaur Kapil Friday Xavier movies coming out your feet hangs in the balance is it really true that the Friday decides so much it really decide where will be the next year and now since these guys make only one or two friends here you can see if there's just so much in security that is the new actors coming along and out what is new actors right now this new this new areas and look at look at how look at how popular youtubers income looking up at the actress who are working on digital showsimpact how do you realise when a menu of minimum 5 finger flopping you have to wonder whether people want to see you anymore I'm with you will be with you are your your Railway Colony more things must play some role in in your admin at the back on and constantly wondering when I question myself so much it must be it must be so much more than that why you hear the stories of substance abuse anddifferent ways it takes a lot and I know that it's not too even admit that you have a problem with the basics of your life when you see your Ahuja rivala contemporary do really well does it does it give the due due due feel or do you have moment which have really happy moment in digital kilo I don't know the doors are symptoms that that thatwhat are you doing up with armed with Anushka speaking about it with a lot of these guys are speaking about it because people also culturally in a society we don't understand something it and reactivity to make fun of it is sad because if you do that more people will be awkward about about talking about it and you know you can deal deal with it is addressing and also going to shrink going to say it so I am here in theit's a matter of fact and bring everyone doesn't end with actors of string on speed I literally talks about it I don't know I don't know if there are many that go on that that that that have that the visitor calories in psychologist but I would imagine that there is a need just given how transit Re transient how difficult is businesses and how to put you on a pedestal at one moment in your padh of pretty soonchange to fast I would imagine that some professional help is not bad idea and I am I am I missing something 2 seater out what is one thing that your audience specifically doesn't know about the world of films I think that people feel that if you are a movie star it's it's a great easy life I don't think it's I don't think so I think the bigger that you are there is a lot of pressure on you I understand as I say this that were you know we're talking about movies Raza Qadrispeed to get really up all the fancy skills and Francis gizmos and everything for free and it was a case of political rich guy that is it's really hard and not saying I am so sad that there is of course there's a lot that pumpkin seed and compensate for the hard life but I do think that the hard work really hard because the the pressure is much more today than it was a few years agolot of pressure up whisky in the game to constantly make the right choices and Ayushmann Khurrana today is probably the number one star in terms of the choices and I can't think of someone who is more pressure on them because he is now has the pressure to constantly make the right choices to find when she had her first floor Shandar which came after 5 hits she was devastated because her first floor and her father legsgood thing I noticed it now you won't be on your toes I can't imagine what I want this and thatbad so many good things don't work so it probably isn't but the kind of pressure which is the Shahrukhsome of the round table with Masand Ananya get good mercilessly trolled the people not know I think it is hard to even the guys who come from from from big names of the famous names do have their own struggle I am an Admin shouldn't articulate is well because she spoke about her father not being on Koffee with Karan se you know everyone has their own reality it it's notcool world your struggle and my struggle me not be the same as may be much more what to use since trivial my struggle mitron trivial my my my insecurities might seem trivial but you not to me right it is and your struggle might seem trivial to the third guy who's who lost his entire family the car crash are you comparing it with your struggle less because he's going to let me know so very very quick to judge is wellBlack Ops Zombies kids who have famous movie star parents and International School and give me more than I could be the person I am in saying that it was some of Bombay is most Elite families that sent the kids to that could be Shahrukh family with with Sachindryer and I've been that grew up in her shoes and know what it's like going up in that environment where se your growing up with a superstar scared and depends a cold and cough your current job and not that is your Reality That is your struggles that's not something that audiences and said he was very quick to judge that you know you are these stories about you in the head with us we going to like a wholebulldog Thomasis playing that Bolero village what was the wife between them after the interviewer tell you after interview we didn't even realise I don't think anyone night and I certainly didn't realise that that was a snap papa Hero what is the weight was pulled out and and and names were made and it and just that little bit I think he said here to see she said she had to say he said I don't give responding in a manner in a manner to slap at her it makes a great TV remix in the mix of Greyif you just isolate that I think this is a great what is actually true and that his reality tried but that doesn't mean that her reality is any less effort that per like she's glad it's not an equal word it's not their world everyone is not a hero you could you can have this conversation only if every with a farewell to everyone has the exact starting point and someone is complaining that over but then sorryabsolutely you doing movie together Mystic messenger roundtable the streets of fire I really enjoyed doing the thank you but what do people not know about them and tell you I never again this because I don't feel it right to say it on my platforms when you a when people say this person was in themcome out and respond to the specimen Se Hi we tried to get Hrithik Roshan but his days we couldn't match if I say that it undermining those were on the table but I won't tell you I promise you we reached out to everyone who's been good in a film that you are there is no limit on how many people with another round table CBC 5 new think Hrithik Roshan not on the round table because Rajiv didn't want him out to every singlePizza choice doesn't deserve to be the only you think that present a great performance that's different but everyone who attacked me saying the job I still that will put this on that we know it's it's a monster to coordinator at it takes to get 5 people that what is the take it takes to be on the tableas a place where we have since their conversations about the craft business what is hard is coordinating events days together their egos it was genuinely scheduling issues involved with Vicky Kaushal was supposed to be on table in this year because of course is incredible in every but but he wasn't in Russia shooting and chronic come back on the 28th December way by which turned around To Bata Dun I could beat it sometimes it's as simple as that as a my point is as long is The Other five on the table deservedTum question my integrity did you feel like any other people the table didn't deserve to be that no you you think so it's also deserve to be that I promise you that person was on that because because we tried in the good that person but everyonenot Bollywood copy our people and and hard sometimes and produces its because they knowtoys everyone deserves to be that there is no it's not only place I think of it as a benchmark below 57 actresses last year I think we have 75 is what we like to hit and more that is if there is 11 and 11 not put an active because only a place for 5 people you know the real version of themselves on camera is a show and then once the cameras of becoming a person to know I have to say I think you're an hour and a halflong should a lot of if you have a damn good at that time table if you are attending your through it up because they see you now in relation to others and I think that people the love you love you for who you are so if you are not being yourself if you can see that our name this attribute is active that everyone loves but he was clearly a few years ago I thiall about two years ago and he was he was being a human being and I will find if it more important versionwaiting to get to know is that you have to be who you are and sometimes that is that is Ranbir Singh who is bizarre and walks in with the Boom box and and it is and quietno you try and quiet and perhaps some hero in a room full of people he is not as as social as he would be one on one but but that will write you know unless you like very spiritually advanced I believe that every career has its pros and its negative so I want to ask you what you specifically a Gai what do you not like about what you do that and watching filmsas long as long as I have the career in some time but sometimes it get tearing it is the joy of it what you want to tailor job that could be because you watch your bad loans may be at one go or of the mind is somewhere else and you got me something going on the the joy of watching films that will come jobbattery sad because you should be you should be a film critic if you don't love it so so you have to connect with me calibrate yourself and may be taking time off or just do something you enjoy writing the social media is a smarter social media is a positive influence at it really can be can be very very intense intense and and texting and and judgemental and and sometimes that is what you know I'm gonna the sweet days when you will you brought a review product reviewemail would tomorrow letter word comes to the first you must be paid for you must be your Biased there is no room for I thought different you thought differently this is film is this is not maths mathematics 2 + 2 will always be phone up a biryani you might really love that I might not any definite offer letters means we have different taste but but people don't get that I think is a society we beskill the if we travel with their Wrong When is right is wrong with quick judgemental

weekend to go watch the movies and I walked in on Monday morning the job they have to watch a movie is the best job in the world till it starts to not be if you up if you allow for those things to get you waiting that you are the truth truth is there will always be on its but allowing them to get to you and an Admin some days you wake up in a really strong areaApne disregard what people are saying and even the slightest a single block and unblock a couple of months it's a It's in the same as you get older but you also and and and and you have to realise that you know it in a node in principle you know that these people abusing you it's just a rupeeprobably they probably don't have great life you know the thing and it's just something I want you please believe that is easy and life to get the numbers even possible to become famous it's difficult for humans and left earn respect I feel for the work you look so genuine with your reviews because a so-called that your authentic UKrespect to the US the whole section of this country so even if there are haters out there I can tell you 90% of people listen to respective Android and possibly even the haters the heading out of the fact that the fact that their respective thank yourespond to the people of raising your only respond attacking where I came from and your in style your entirely within your right to disregard I try the abuse and and every morningthere is a concept called the concept of negative bias is which is that the human mind the weights built-in positive things happening on the negative tax through the comment section is well this is actually a good thing happening you tend to focus on the respect that comes away and like I just wanna ask you one question to end this conversation which is that a lot of youtubers I am talking from this side of the ballBollywood and definitely want to become what is Siddhant Chaturvedi is becoming what Varun Dhawan has become an income Shahrukh do you see bollywood casting the current top youtubers you know as mainstream peoplebig is Ranveer Singh in Varun Dhawan and Ranbir Kapoor and Tiger Shroff are you like them they have that level of superstardom changed its just that level of that raise the level of madness of also you know there was a time when you didn't have access to write to us at the weather today they want on social media that I will talk to you but magazine report AP postalprobably true and what is at the next the next generation of superstars will not be from film actually said he used the word is in it mean to be rescheduled YouTube start and the social media superstar song Superstar area that is it possible and don't look only at films for the next generation superstars of the lines are blurring so those those superstars from non film areas might be co-optedtickets will have you could you could be or you could be a race car driver with with huge following and will incorporate you so I do think I can you sing it with a lot of is am are they now popping up in its rules for a lot of the standard cell of youtubers and how they were getting small role but but was playing them said that in the what Bollywood is to become smart on is I could use them as they are because they are so popularcharacters you see with someone and you see someone like a projector I am creating characters in a woman has 89 character to the guise of good actors its uses required from one smart to know how to utilise these massive influences and and I don't see why because I already talked about how the only people buying tickets in going

that seriously when you when you get your promotions you know I've been promoted all now I am eligible for business class a take it easy The Perks of the job should never become more important than job itself so so I had to live like in I am I am now give me that I am not done nothing youyou just get your business doing a job like and we wanted a and I mean you are you had like a bunch of Carriers which is after that but again today what are you doing sharing it right because it was very good movie to talk about your job is because your job involves you being on the screen with peoplethere is a certain amount of love and what's the word in the job it's our job and distributed as a job you can result from majdur someone in a sense of Innocence I want to ask you what give the fire to switch and tired acting and your passion for art and growing up bar at the age of like getting around 30 to 35 it was always a place when you are in some point I knew I would get there a voice told you theI don't know with the voice but I think to win every child you can you feel you belong where are you say when I started watching movies a child is a very little child I felt I knew how to make movies and you could do it better like me I just knew I know this is all this is all I have seen it before may be in a past life or maybe Resort from others whom I don't know but I I I was so familiar with the movie The Mermaidhow is a nervous childhood also speak too much fun event on stage as a 11 year old woman professionally he came to unite here so I belong over them so I think is very important for youngsters know that you belong somewhere and that calling will pull you there and you need to listen to it when calling you are you need to listen to it so what was that moment for you why you like wait hold on stop breakless change was it so strange maybe even I12 photography it was the first stepping stone to the visual medium ok my training you know why I feel that because I just had a attraction for it and that I I saw still pictures morph into moving pictures in my head for some reason is real around in removing staff and u u u ustill photographer I located differently than one fine day there is this frames will come handy to me I don't know anything really so let me tell you are the perspective from this side of the covid-19 old 10 year old man at the moment Munna Bhai MBBS after the movie definitely a love Sanjay Dutt you also the guy who's talking like everyone had a smile like with the whole laughing therapy and performance on screen when you doing that movierealise how much your life is not changed after that know when it changed after I had another device if I am allowed to use the advice is don't look at the morning headlines when your body kit that goal ever hope to open goal you first should the goal then finish the game then party with your friends and then single the morning headlines a lot of commentators alwaysopen Google I was thinking of the morning headlines big Red flag looking at the celebration so no one Munna bhai ke marble didn't even know it would be such a big hit forget about changing changing our lives everyone was affected by the phone I think that's very important event on my second or third your shooting unit came to take 2 interviewsAbhishek Abhishek Jain interview karna mere ko I don't want to talk to a table in no position what am I going to talk about that I am in shooting with the last 3 days is nothing to talk about it into the interview because you've got to be eligible for interview dukan is available todayI have grown up watching you do a liver failureits finest very awkward this now someone came in Cine is I don't know how to listen I find output to listen to praise know that people don't like praise a strange paradox zero order reaction I don't worrymovie primarily about entrepreneurship ai503 Rajkumar said the cinema Vikatan interview he said that acting as a lot like entrepreneurship I have the same question do you do some well look at yourself as Businessman who is selling a product which is the ability to act and so glad he said he said because I like a fresh perspective on things I always look and acting very friendly and never looked at it as entrepreneurship I am very interested in knowing what you said could you in a nutshell tell me that you are going onproduct or service and technically as an actor your taking out something from inside you putting out on screen so in a way to the product they bring out for the real world and the movie was either consumers technically so have a look at yourself no never alone level up to date like this and I am very impressed that he is this this take an hour before but what would you say about the movie made in China becomes a little intimate know about the process of acting under your work for me because it is more intimate in the sense that I takeas a great privilege to be an actor not because you on screen not because people are going to watch any other people people say nice things at the end of the day save a critical error creating their own we forgive them for it but a but especially people do tend to forget the term the Rotten Tomatoes but and I always remember the ones that touched them and whenever I meet people is a OK so you Munna Bhai MBBS 2 someone saidlb for Me Samaja to buy this for me and they talk about it in and that's it that's pretty good but for me I look at myself with a greater responsibility not not directly to the film indirectly to the film to the director of the makers to the producer but directly to the character that I am to breathe life into gayak version I am giving birthto solve too hot to mind I become as a mother father of the character and artistic Amoeba I am making a baby grow up CM face the world ever see him laugh your seat cry every associate being exultant and and for you that your child you've created it and only younot created man and woman you created it by yourself and for that breath that you put inside another another character you are responsible for it and in turn that character is responsible to the to service the story and the service the directors 0 when Asthana of the characters of the character in made in China react to somethingreacting to situation all I gotta put it in the characters DNA that if somebody needs you to control your anger or you will explode explored as a parent of that character have a program dhimsa talking about thisopen pedestal for the country that people are observing you know as a YouTube I feel like my purpose is to provide positivity or to teach people celebrate knowledge what would you say is the purpose of your career and not saying like you know the internal what's the purpose what's the larger the are you doing process it to your friends or a very basic level I am I never looked at myself as an actor who to make me feeldoes a creative person you do feel in creative leave you done well there is some fun in that but I think as my mother always as the tube in given a talent not to feed your ego I did this in this particular when it this method of that when nobody gives a damn what is your job is to entertain people to bring a smileexactly what main Rajni said the Talent is given to you not for you to feel good about yourself of cost usual but the greatest thing is people get a sense of joy and a sense of escapism bad word Yeh better word bad word meaning is the same I just like the word that I think sometimes it should stay with you and that is why even you as a 10 yearsaw movie sticks with us there has to be something is there has to be something to be said for contemporary consciousness why did why did virus affect us why is everyone could relate to it somewhere exactly as they relate to it go back to the child in the try and understand what the viruses in their life it to them make them better make them worse thatjob to make people feel you know what I overcame that man I know of a very very well known person who didn't call me for three years after 3 Idiots release any call me three years later as you know I want to tell you about by the said about really just saw this in my side table and and I had a virus in my life and that man is to haunt me in my dreams and I have overcome that he terrorized methank you for helping to overcome it because I can talk to you I will talk to wire and feeling much better now if you I am not saying you changed lives but it's important that if it is got no relevance to your life then that character will have no relevance on screen and is not related to friends in general are made in Chinas********* I think there is a lovely social message that that goes out there and I used this line to say that you know if someone has a heart problem you go to a cardiologist young one has a diabetes issue diabetologist over the word is for that on ophthalmic surgeon for I if you have a dysfunctionthe physical dysfunction in your private like I think it's important to go to the right and a doctor but and I think that there are two things one is one is for treatment and the other is for awareness this such a lack of awareness because it is made into a tablet of the subject no no is good to do with your own body this so much confusion as so many misconceptions about typing is open the doorbit error when I think as a nice nice way of looking at it it good messages laptop and social message Chennai social message coming back to your real life the real Baner Android how earn money change your life and in the film gana Mani film Bollywood money order that change your life was really I was very happy to be associated with the name of that could not everyone is so that I could dobhoot once I made some money when is first time I went to to to to London had no money on me I want to go to Google with the unit I had no money and 128 MB and I and I want to pick out DVD from my favourite films and I could affect the 2Vikhroli by one and I said you know what I wish I could bye-bye 1020 visit something I really love is a kid to see all the forms when I was a kid if I could buy win and what all those will then relieve my my childhood all over again so I think that's a very simple want for money and to is I love travelling and an the first time that I travelI travel only on the expense of someone else because some reason for this should have that you're for this event and an always produced by the buyer is there by the ticket and I just said I would love to travel abroad right in the early days when I didn't have too much money that's an option that should be with me and the day I can say that I am good I am going off for alikewap overnight in Lage Raho Munna Bhai and responsibilities attempt to much package even during that time and Munnabhai was being shown the United Nations at the UN Agencies I am New York ISI told me they are tomorrowmain a jata hun event that give me a great sense of freedom and to choose and go by which to choose is better but I like I could go and represent my myself because the producer did call Vinod Chopra did quality I am so happy I am so happy let let let us by the aggressive know I want to buy a ticket and money does that you just makes you feel a little worthyin your own words scored a goal is celebrated just for a bit and you can start playing a game that should I feel when right now know when this moment this happen it's like you're celebrating a golden those moments when will come back to the shooting place you come back to this place is so beautiful time together and it may be because of that disasters holiday the cover of all at once I hope they sendlyco tuning point into enjoy myself have a few questions please go to use Fem what is famed not you what Fame kind of later in life and you see my pain comes only in message things up for some people writing you be given to the point where your pretty stable in the head I don't know but frame is a big so I think I was lucky to I was lucky enough amgive me such a big frame actually humbled me I said you know either I go and become a nuisance to see nuisance and

mannish enjoy it while while it's while is good learn a lot and learn something new because frame softens the sofa you think a little more inside the sofa if you have learnt something new thenyou may not require the same on and still have a career to something else within that within within the confines of the industry knowledge is very protective something new in learning something new and being humble enough to learn something new year at the protection that knowledge is the protection and what happened knowledge knowledge and humility I would sayok I want to ask you about your childhood

don't get married then you'll never get married to control your supportthis age should whatever but your career should be kind of decided by the time you 23 by the necessity you should be an expert in rule when will you stop and listen to that calling that I mention some time ago there is a calling in your and your mind will step out of your mind and going to year and will call youand tell you in your telephone telephone here and I'll be able voice setting tell you if I'm inside this is where you belong and if you saw it is a child don't let it go because you will only live with regret that

paintersomebody teach practice practice and our everyday on social media in a water before you take that big classic decision of dumping your your million-dollar job as you know what I'm saying I'm trying to be a director next year I am I am I been learning how do they are sprinter died of a 7 years nowcrazy in the middle of the active now how many years I just came back from New York after being a book shop that are part of the process of getting knowledgeI will accept the challenge to enjoy the challenge that something young people need to become slightly elder brothers like like likebaby advice again is that you look around you and you see a lot of Fame floating around any see that so you want to get the faster and the first thing that I said there are no magic bullets and there are no shortcuts in if you really want to excel in it you don't start from ground zero level u start from underground level will go to build the foundation to make adig inside down so so don't look Karan is it this time he's making so much money doing this and these does you know is everybody can do what you doing you know you know your doing a pretty in-depth conversation you are not you don't have followers because when is good looking To Aisa but the you know and I don't look at other people'sI want to be famous because the last thing in the world is you want to be famous at the risk of getting it right get it right then enjoy the Fame after she get it right all of lifewhat's what's the most beautiful thing about life according to you that you can shop Shauk yourself with

doing they have defied the human body to do such beautiful things with you can do the same thing with your mind if you don't have a great body only one human teaching to your kids what would it be ok Allah Hafiz1 beat 60 songs would be you will never learn anything if your humble and you not learnt anything if you're not applied what you learnt I learnt in unsure of great knowledge on this book as practical what do you apply it down to just learn something injoy don't be pedantic aboutbasically done will be the best car and humbly done would be the best and your a lot of factors have ever come to me Naam Sunny lekin old man now really know what what what do you think you are some tips that I can't teach in 5 minutes but if you remain humble you take care of your loveare you take care of the Opium of Fame simple what should people stay away from in life according to you people stay away from life you can stay close to anything you want to have used to but I genuinely feelbootleggers bootlickers maybe young person goldwater thing again is making the young for good luckordinary family college kids so get talking your your get away withunderneath God message to message I don't know that it is an entertaining story which has a label below is that enough to meet the story of a man who wants to get some self worthI want to the film was to work with Rajkumari so nice to nice to to work with within me the wonderful khilai ki so it's an entrepreneurial journey who wants eventually I have come to the Cruiser all life and all that we do in our lives is about self worth enough feel worthy you want people to say I thinkthe stories and then we have my character Dr Badi who is the s********* who is just bring a love n is a need me for authenticity so that that was the friendship but I think someone did an interview that it is it you think is a Taboo subject at the moment you call it tab it becomes tab not it's aboutyou your own body the river to take care of relationships because they can suffer frustrations and the mental problems that can go spiral spiralling out of control so I think there are a lot of themes in this film and young people will enjoy a few yearsone last question I like that you know this is but Yogi Cena always learning on a daily basis what do you do to keep your brain stimulator I keep my brain sharp by thismisconception about memory that I don't think so it works because you recall what happen to you as a 11 year old when you were a 15 year old when you 18 year old very attentive to the last memory is very calling not the 11:00 urinary so you can keep your memory always fresh coronaviruswho was the actor in that that movie don't tell me I close my eyes and an and I tried to think that my brain is like a computer chip a good I will never check it up on the IMDB I will always fish Outta My Head it helps me to stay sharp memory memory is is a thing that I will value a lot to keep the mind of agile learn somethingnew learn something new stop you many speak like an old man with rising advisable stop behaving and talking like an old man you know if you are talking to do what's your average like 2222 euros not like a 16 year oldwhy should I talk like them communicating with free to your I feel like I'm talking about 25 what's the word thank you thank youthank you bro this so beautiful broadcasted a taxi

like you have two feet put those two feet in three industry To Matlab meri meri pant fat but only if you are a little more I think you should enter with an approach to you know what this guy must be more talented this guy must be more this girl must be more charming but you know who is the hardest workerthat's the whole point of being in a room being in a setup that baki sab bahut acche Hain per sabse Jyada Kisi Main Karunga na to industry to kya aapka talent Bhi Kahin Ja Rahe 31 to 35 by what is happeningyou tell me man Yudh Ragni out of suburbs are that is the biggest thing I have done and I don't know how many years and how was the movie are doing Ranveer Singh out of country only to UK we went to not part of UK Glasgow London Manchester oval we shot at laws we shot at I think tunbridge Wells where Kirmani actually made the world record Hua bahut Karachi is there to be there and actually feel what they must be feelingso that ground is not like a big big ground with big Stadium Vibe or with big stands that ground is that casual ground but very well maintained the boundary ke bahar HAL lagti ho number one thing I will use to describe you is the sentence that yourforever student your Ham don't know about you but don't actually know much about your college students they looked at her and they think being Indian like it used to be being inducted into the beginning of your story and student mentality was at the beginning how you transition you left Chandigarh you came to Bombay what happen and how have you practice film andok Bade future so start from the point I was doing what they want to do the kids don't know what they want to do and finally I think I found my calling Mein gallery Mein fail ho gaya tha vahan per + 1 + 2 ka jo Yahan per aapka FIR to use hisab se main theatre ke auditions Diye I joined theatre group Uske bad kida offorming with me in the a** that said Kuchh To ISI life mein kar le chalega before and after that I figured they are Koi future Hani roller hockey Mein yah wali side Lekar Chalte Hain in Chandigarh from there I wanted to do Radeon Bombay to cut back from Bombay U1 the top radio Jockeys in Chandigarhmatlab at the age of 18 19 he was very surprising for me also I don't know what the world is all about it if you are come the rating and the number one show is my the number one job is you and Amla Ka Achartwo minors came back to Bombay sadun television shows my faasos De trap as a prank show it was on Achanak all bindass ok and after that being Indian came in so you know every carrier has waves right so data was a first wave I wrote it recently while then being Indian so the wave has a drop down I am happy that it's still going on since being Indian I think the wave has only gone up because television has happened and it in my bellyAam happening that is also something that I have managed to crack a little bit not just this terrible due to more fans in this year only that happened wow so I'm guessing ke I want to am in some way or the other I am also Discovery myself as you said I'm forever student and discovering ki are mere ko koi platform Chhod Nahin I want to be one of those few talents in the country or probably the only talent in the country who is relevant on digital television and film I don't want to leave any of theab darvaja Khol Ham Khud Ke Liye Thodi Baat Karoge opportunity you might strike in you know learn put your face of the year on all of these things from the same right so people know that the mirror nursery pays you a lot I don't think the understand the amount it pays you just through films and television like people who host TV shows even as much as I had 20 30 lacs per episode things like that so can you just like give us an idea about what kind of money does teland film pay for short face but not as much as television show honestly the figure that you said is not even close that just hooks in the market of 2030 lacs per episode 500 unless your producing a big show a like if you are talking about being a producer for let's assume Dance India Dance that he posted on let's assume a bigger show all of the shows which are stage shows reality shows nonfiction shoesis that you get in your dreams episode ok bye dreams you mean ke Achcha item Ho Gaya Aaj Shahrukh Khan a Gaya Shahrukh Khan ne ek ki jagah 2 episode ka content de diya but probably would get an a day easy but that's what the maximum amount is orwhat is the highest paid television talent and round has to be Kapil Sharma not because you know he was not because we also produce is it also because of that Got Talent that he has the power house has never got a chance to work alongside the team at the Kapil Sharma show I know a lot of Writers because I am from Punjab Chandigarh for Punjabi gana thoda theka Le Rakha Haiit's like one of those are kya Kahate Hain vah unemployment Yojana that that Rohit Shetty has a Golmaal Kapil Sharma pocket from each episode from fluid I have no idea about his numbers for sure but I think the newspaper article read that right now is under a contract of hundred crores with Sony I don't know how many years probably is per annum for 2 years or three years I have no idea that's becauseI doing that show but I know for a fact everybody who has reached the top notch of the industry was digital with solution whether IT firms is leaking in a lot of money but none the less however all this money is not in its very rightly said in the acting industry also you know you don't get paid to perform that day I don't get paid to act that day you don't get periodto be the talk shows that day you get paid for all the skills at that you've developed all these years and the waiting that you had and the patience and perseverance at that one fine day so it's if if if those numbers are looking very fancy is great because they are fancy but people don't know the hard work that with the Hustle the perseverance the persistence I mean it's maddeningI mean I start from a call to be honest in bimbisar Nagar Mahananda Dairy ke pass mein is time per to aur abhi to develop ho gaya hai usmein per Aur Bhi bure HAL the from there to whatever I am trying to do like I think I have a half decent career and where am trying to reach I can only did I not even at the tip of the Iceberg I know for a fact that there is so much potential like right now I feel only five to six percent of a potential is being tabletwhat is the box format is talking on the road with somebody write it used to be one of the smallest formats when Roshan Abbas used to do Hamen everybody looks after Roshan Abbas because of whatever he has made of himself what is the need of himself you don't know I know but I want to view a still from there he said to be very bhayankar he started his own event company and his company is doing mad business like from there he has invested in companybleach bleach went for a whooping I think a thousand crores close 2002 group M and the guys are doing great if I have the right figures 967 700 something that's also a lot so I mean I don't remember the exact figure that is the figure so Roshan was very smart like I mean I look up to him he doesn't even know exist a lot of people don't know Ibut I know for a fact ke of those are the things that you want to open up to those are the things that you want to look forward to itne Sal saying who was he was just an anchor and started off as a talk show host right so from their Cyrus broacha you should do a lot of work so I just did a podcast with him and bro I can't tell you it was like I think Aisa Kyon MandirI was almost like that and the fact that he said if he is Sachin Tendulkar I am Virat Kohli as I drove up I am with you and Akshay Kumar ofstories that get a very small format newMoore Moore Moore Moore Moore Moore Moore not take offence on the Jupiter was just like a metaphor to be derived from the book people listen to this part of the eyes have changed if I put something on social media it gets stabbed in newspapers and then I have to be like oh yeah Usher Yeah Bismillahwhatever we breathe cure I think it's full of surprises life has given a lot but I think I'm just very hungry for more day in Day Out 24/7 work is what I think I think you are the kind of person who came into industry and realise about this so much to do and that made you hungry do anyone no idea so I am a Punjabi right because of that I get a lot of this film is also happening I get a lot of opportunities to host Punjabi shows now a lot of China's are comingyou know you are doing nonfiction shows you should hosted a lot of films come up to me and Secure Punjabi you should do this role that role I am saying listen you know what there are three industries that I am already put I like you ke you have two feet put those two feet in three industry To Matlab meri meri pant fatri that I have kept away from the fourth Avenue weather is singing weathersongs because I I sing as well but that every Punjabi Punjabi mein Kahate Hain Ki I would have to single Milte Hain aur batao into Ke Niche talent ka Milta Hai to stay away and stay focused because what is the best case scenario for you at age 55 wownear retirement like the look bad but it's not that the number which I am a little superstitious I can't even say like that I don't know how 5555 all my phone number 5555 productions yogic power that camefeeling ke liye I see myself is somewhere to reach a place where Seth rogen is Adam Sandler is Sacha Baron Cohen is Sean Penn is my version of the DeadSudheer write this act and this was produced whatever they are doing themselves and I want to hit that space and to know if I'm on the right track I know for a fact that I am in the right zone as of now I think that I'll inside a shining literally light is reflected so what do you mean what do you mean zone mental zone characters own career zone both can you describe them like why do you think it right right right because a I been able toon the path that I think has been rightly called for me by myself or other two types of energies when it comes to working no 1 light Hoti Hai jismein Log Tumhen dekhna Chahte Ek light Hoti Hai Ki Ab tum kahan Jana chahie Arshad Warsi doing Dedh Ishqiya Shahar having Shahar it's a It's one of those like nobody I don't know alot of people since her but it was best performances but he is knownpin socket the world want to see my circuit or a funny guy but actually what he did with the coming back to a more local a more relevant example in some way or the other Naseeb Sab also was invisible in front of you that good that is the difference and in terms that light I have managed to stay away from what only people want me to do I have managed to pick up what I want to do what people want to do what I want to dopeople want to and then amalgamated I think that is a sweet spot any performer can get are not talking this as an actor am also talking as a performer I am also talking as a television host am also working as a digital talent / youtuber / blogger or house we like to put it ok to understand the matrix of it and combine commercial value with great creative output with the fact thatAchcha cal the creative juices flowing out and that you think so sweet zone as of now where projects are coming in I have to figure out I have changed my management from earlier it was a person managerhow to a person whom also understand scripts also waiting scripts to there are there is some influx that is coming in all those things are for the bigger scheme of things so I think that is what I mean by the zone that is the spot from the spot there is only another ladder that I have to climb and from there is it goes on and so forth and looking at you being Indian days I remember to another podcast with you once upon a time and you told me how use psychology during being Indianforever student mentality goes beyond just a job like you want to learn other subjects to be up to applied to your real life and to your career as explain that Psychology in being in them and the program Hota Haiwhat would basically that means is ke jo aap Bhul Jana chahte ho Kisi Se is it is being a mind reader in early man V this is what it feels like aap Agar Ek tarike se question Puche aapko se tarike se jawab Milega like if I want to ask you the smallest of the difference is the how are you doing what will you say who are doingcoming in my mind so not just that also the fact that I just change one word and the whole question has changed the Vibe has changed of the answer all these things plus the fact that what we want to take out from the audience to understanding the mindset of somebody uses walking on the street whether to approach them or not approach them whether they are in a bad mood a good mood whether there in a neutral mood intelligent answer Dega ya nahin Dega that's why all the psychologywomen from and by NLP what we meant was ke yaar jo aapko answers in our nikal Walon Aaj Nahin cal you plant thought in somebody's head ke Agar Main Kah Raha Hun Na ke let's assume there is happening in the government right now bahut badhiya chij hai right aur somebody who is a neutral guy he will listen to me kya badhiya chijMein Dal Diya and being Indian also note that we like you protect people is not that I just giving an example of NLP but advertising is it be if nothing else so and not that comes to Kisi Ko Road per Chalte hue Ki Nahin Hamare wale answer dena everybody had the right tobirds and equestrian Patang thoughts in question and then that sits in the mind and because there is a story I don't know if anybody knows what spot have a lot of storytelling in them like you know you don't watch a voxpop consciously you listen to work sperm like this podcast I think Kafi children they will not be watching you probably or failing with your socks or how I am doing what mymy hand will be listening and tripping on this kahan yaar u Kuchh Baat chal rahi hai so in terms of that works Poppers also story telling story ask if you go to give you another example if you go to Delhi and talk about pollution and the idea is to sell a mask that the brand that wants to be involved in it so you start from pollution in what is pollution how is it affecting Delhi what isbad side of it because that is wood side table with solution kya ya solution hai ya galat hai ya galat galat galat galat hai ekadam sahi hai yah productKari ne bataya bhi bahut Logon Ne koshish Kariye per nobody is bhi nahin bol to kirakat all these things will be done Tu Bhi Shayad nahin kar Payenge because I will get my jeans and thatI was never a funny guy I got my first job because I used to crack a really bad jokes like I was an intern mineral station all my family Chandigarh vahan mein bahut gande jokes subject kya hogatop as Bada that a jokes and Achcha theek hai marketing / entrepreneur Hamesha Se Jinda thaBaki sari chij Aati Hai Babbar Sher aata hai Poonam ka interest from there I think the only reason why I tried and developed the funny Side Of Me is because I never used to get attention from the opposite sex I am being very honest nice things have changed now ok but that's not a lot of guys and I can I can feel it is known asyou can't say there are lot of guys and have seen it in my own eyes in different ok so I've seen sale kutta playing is games with my own eyes and there's a lot of viewers of this podcast the life I want to give thethis value is a lot of guys listening to you talking and answers in I want to become funny in order to be sexy so now how can you ignore can you break down the how to be funny problem how do you actually become 5% how to work on that fastmeet so ke there is no there is no rule to it there are no Basics to it it's it very subjective is like success there is no formula ho sakta haibakwas Ho Kisi Ke Liye kam na Karen ho sakta hai Kisi ke kam abhi Jaenge I want to be funny is by watching a lot of content and remembering things ok making associations with 5 lines which are in a different situation but can be used in a different situation as well agar koi 5 line eggplant to use ho sakti hai onion per Nahin ho sakti badauda shapes are differentAgar at London baingan Hyderabadi in this was my favourite word me so when it comes to being funny mere ko aisa lagta hai ki main bahut jyada Jab content dikhana are used to chat on snl David Letterman Jimmy Kimmel obviously I didn't watch Fallon because he's not funny Colony was a little matlab mere ko aisa lagta hai ki is subjective but I don't find finalat all he just goofball 1 5 9 Bata Do falon Ki Jo Kisko Yadav Ko Nahin Hai after watching that content you know what this is this is how you can use it in the Indian scenario where are you living in in the Punjabi scenario where your probably hitting on a PanjaBombay scenario where are you working in this kind of an industry Association worked with me a lot you studied funny people basically a lot funny people Laut I studied a lot of humour subjectively a lot of things I did not agree with you on the Internet a lot of things I agreed with so I am in a manner subconscious mind ko battalion now Karate Ki Tarah nikal Jaati Hai bakwas cheese I always say you know the time of the jobquotes jokes on the now just with good timings they become Panchayat like there's a Punjabi video I did and it's one of the most viral video that we were done usme 5 line hello hello hello hello hello hellotable on across the across this whole time span that have lived in now know that every 50 but would have learnt is ki yaar it's humour is my Association humour is my relatability humour is a study where you need to understand what to associate with what is sometimes totally opposite things work sometimes just fitting a word in their takes to deliverlike you say you you meet someone to defeat and you visited your feet are so small that you can just call me a normal PunjabiI like you doing so simple humour is karna Aise pakad Nani humorous cancer in the simplest of the things if you see Jimmy Carr as a stand up comedian he is on the prettiest mines and you know what is the king of one liners and I worship Kevin Hart his he is the energy at the human behind release all build up my study guide likewise why do you think we are bonding or so but I feelsituation null and he brings an energy and he is more of a build up that kind of a funny guy while on the other hand steam car is pure wait give line after line after line of the line I mean the lines that he has are a mazya I tried suicide once I don't know how it worked outthings that the study the understanding its the Vibe that you can detach of a room when you enter allotment and when I go to pitch a project as a production house or has something that we want to do at the logon ka mood Ban chuka Hota Hailearn from the world ever YouTube channel for World called Charisma on command it's the one shall I go back to every six months and I went what is just social tricks and I know that I am a very charismatic person in person like I am also very modest yes most important person by most modest but I know that I am a lot of sales and I get a negotiationsdiscussing movie started and I'm very glad that at a certain age you like to touch the floor of self identification that just happened to have no real life but I know that I want to take my life so the way you studied for making a content as good as it can be a study to make my business situation as positive for me has written a big part of that is humour a big part of that is what I call platonic floating morning images of dost Bankarwhat does is that It Breaks the ice with specially the opposite sex example one social trip Planning can be non platonic also if you want to do romantically techniques are you have ignored and Diusize thank you and your very nice smile but only thing I like what I don't like anything but it does give compliment you put them in every laughing complement half tension tension with a insult a very gentle Indiayou use it if you want to romantically summer but also if you are in a professional situation and you just have to break the ice with the lady it works very well as improve the situation will see something about the mind and then I'll be like that I am better than my brain is faster just you like it or you know if it's like something and informing animal woodman content is better than your company so it really humanizedit is it is I think half of the deals are half kya I think 99.9% is had done with shopno Amin oil shock shock in all its kind works on internet what works is humour and chocolate and nothing else there so all of those things that kinda like stimulate your brain and get a reaction I think your bank Monroe and about that entering rooms is a very quick cricket We Will Smith is record internal uses takealot take when your first making an appearance in the room first meeting of youryou need to raise your energy levels a lot compared to the average energy of the said the room is already if the concert if a guy is coming state should be the normal roomI love how you put this all into theory you done all level I thought about it in theory and I am sure that it works and I'm sure because I am and you are both of us are examples of the just not thought about these things are regarded as ke upar story be here and I liked this is one subject does not taught in school look good when you all time most important subject social how did you develop its a lot of it is correct and one side is called content that I went out searchingcontact me to psychology content body language content also talking to people left eye test a lot of these theories out sometimes I create the role that a comedian testing is material exactly I create my own social theories ki OK what about district now will this also works so I am just an in overtime you realise something was something I don't know when you shouldn't be using these things like that push pull things sometimes with introverted women it really doesn't work back fibre type introverted womenneed to put them in a very comfortable place Megan talk more about the topic that they enjoyed talking about a lot of Netflix and chillhow do you it's a social game but you meet introvert chicks matlabhow to defend myself see the physical energy of a person and Instagram energy of a person is a very good titles and Society CM a person Instagram feed you can tell a lot about what is important to them and what is not ok tell me what is my phone I want to know while while we get your phone I will tell you the general route to study some people they will only put up photos of themselves to the friends ok so this is the kind of person who kind of gives more infoto what is outside the rather than what is inside them some people don't have any humans on their own field I will these are the most humans are there is bad photographers in it and make it big but mostly it's like a Shepherd pups save the animals only for photos of situation on the road and taking black and white again very outward visions of the people with that some people will only product photos of themselves and their friends and the kind ofusually we want to stay away from under the influences and their job ok and even with influences if you see the field of a person if they have put a lot of black and white pattern is there something and learning experiences of hypothesis and I don't know this confirms you black and white pictures are sign of little self-inflicted harm in the pressure on them about something it would be anything from Bayana Carriers to just their relationships with knotsI want something to get done but extremely satisfied with joyful propose colour photography study that came out that said something like this that people who really enjoyed black and white hotel and leisure photographer then the game is difference between normal and black and white photos and reporting that my photos out of yourself you are trying to express it in a very subtle socially acceptable way so a lot when I see and prozac and kind of tell the moods just from their Instagram profilelight under your company is called mountain matlab if you anything that is not colourful now tell me what do you make of all of this is my Instagram feed one you are in the middle of big release not the 83 stuff you've come to bombay metal lot of people like you who have had parallelYouTube and industry that come from outside the city something from inside Bombay and they are the people connect to the most because no matter how much you need an intellectual level only the understand your struggle the way you understand it and you really value like the people you meet in media and meet you are built for the media industry so you can't imagine yourself in any other I tell you tomorrow ok I'll give you 50 million dollars a year but you have to work in engineering formulas I don't value money andI don't believe anyone as much as a value the video of needs that you meet someone who has a lot but you really value those experiences not for the money but the pure Joy looking back and Singh ok I was on that stage once I did this event in front of sale and Ekta Kapoor like you valueaxis or even your kind of sea as a part of the Yearespecially when you're someone who comes in front of camera you your job is to love yourself so there is definitely that vanity element that find that the particle of choice but if you want the media industry probably wouldn't be when we not at all at all so if you see something captions they are very very modest modest being the word of the pot Garden I can also take a scroll down and recently this very less black and whitewhen but also I think there was not a lot like a lot but there was this elements and and that came out of a little bit of loneliness this is my also do yoga allows you to see layers of people talk about themaur Ranveer ko Instagram if they sell plate plate plate you know what we should Different designs of the play coming back to the social media space there before everyone else was the first JainYouTube in terms of money and in terms of cultural impact where do you see YouTube social media always going forward in the next ten twenty years was happened because I am asking you worked in multiple Industries your perspective he was also seen your people they believe it only Gadhvi social media This Is the End of the world I guess before social media hit India it hit USA because I think USA jomunate the World Culture and populate the world pop culture as welland seats in ideas ke vah this is the next this is why do you think that the superpower know that you wouldn't agree but that is how it works classic example you take America the digital Industries always moving the television industry has always been booming be used most of their IPS as reality shows in India most of their concepts as fiction shows in India and their ratings are as high as ever and they are doing reference they've made alternate wins black Ricky Gervais Golden Globes venue hosted for thetime is again a demigod when it comes to human because his humour is an offence is going to be enough moneycompanies Banane wali company ka revenue generated Hota Rahega Delhi Mor companies that will do more work like Disney just bought Fox out of Nowhere in India to the Star channel is all for was all fox and that has been taken over by Disney Disney any and who thought Fox should be loved Disney and take it under the wings Reliance who had 51% stake in Viacom and that has been bought by Sonyok hun you are Mukesh Ambani company will sell shares or Viacom ka controlling stake back to Sone which is another television channel so you get what I'm saying you so while all the three industries are booming table keep on booming nobody is going anywhere the money is only going to get bigger you are only going to get bigger but only if you have said as hard as everybody else and a little more I think whenever you enter the room you should enterUske you know what this guy must be more talented this guy must be more this girl must be more charming but you know who is the hardest worker that's the whole point of being in a room being in a setup that baki sab bahut acche Hain per sabse Jyada Hi Sahi Magar vah Aage na industry to kya per talent Bhi Kahin Jaane and when it comes to YouTube and social media platforms also us has I think time and again proven that all these threeblouse of entertainment and going to coexist very nicely and existing India is also not going anywhere everybody is saying no you know Tik Tok Ashok range I just did of rest and it was like the fan fest of ticktokers and I just host it and I figured even though the TG is different people are going mad if Tiktok the next big thing no everybody is going to score exist everybody will make the space Aaj Agar Ek Barlike let's assume ABC is allocating money to Ad Hoc in advertising television in film branding and social media ko kya hoga uske sath Rakhenge acha Tik Tok social media Se nikaalte Haindo you know social media is the next big thing next big thing but you know what I mean films are already there bro they are the biggest that you can't film people say that they want to host the TV show so that they can reach to the masses ka so everybody is going to coexist your gonna she is see you want to see a lot of shows that come on digital that will be later on taken by television a lot of shows that come on television can be later on I know people who are binge watching Mahadev on hotstarnot everyone can you believe that like this is what content in do when its crossing boundaries and a lot of people watch Bigg Boss on voot so that kind of transcending Brown boundaries and breaking it I don't think anything is going anywhere but for a confused college ke do want to get into the media industry now it advisable all this in mind just whatever works for you honestly find your space and heated hard plan well I thinksay a lot of people are like my dream is to become a singer Achcha kiya kya hai uske liye to dekh and well you have planned well some of the Other abhi Agar Hamen podcast kar rahe to de raha hai be like in November for huge amount of yours and hours that have put into reaching this position where two people can have a decent intelligent aur bakwas conversation karna bahut jyada Jaruri that college kid I would just a plan well and hit the hardest where you want to go the most weather is social media you want to becomeSarathkumar hit serial go out audition you want to be an actor in films go out you want to be write a director's right see a lot of content you want to be a producer put a small film together put a short film together that how you will learn and that's how you will grow where is the money will come from initially initially its anyway like today I can pitch you are short film and if you are interested you have produced if I don't have money toI just had a film on an iPhone 11 and iPhone you can make it on oneplus you can make it on redmi on how to pronounce it it doesn't matter your work is work and this is the eyeballs all across the globe there was one video I did and I just need a Dracula joke like I'm talking about 3-4 years ago in viral in RomaniaAkhilesh come from Dena and develop k y z causing a Dracula and understand you want to go plan and execute do not feel shy with a bad product it's fine everybodymessage you think all these comedian Kevin Hart Ricky Gervais the biggest of the comedians on this globe all these comedians come up with great jokes advance know they keep on testing the material the keep on doing bad Joseph keep on doing sets everywhere and that is when the reach their 1 hour special that you see on Netflix or Amazon so I guess it's all hit and trial and bro like also won most here there were no mention is the six degrees of separation theory for lot of peoplefancy terms for every thing anyone u name on the planet it can be Bill Gates it can be Steve Jobs anyone is only 6 people away from you like as a new love someone who knows or know someone who knows Steve Jobsduniya mein aapke sath Avtar hai aap acche HongeI went into a radio station in Delhi and came out with the job offer without knowing anybody can you be that I don't know a lot of people have done that or not in a radio station Venom 18 years old I am going from metro from Noida to Gurgaon I just hear a radio station and oblique Hawa yeu frequency to gana mere pass print out coronavirus cvk I get on the next top forever that a radio station is I walked in I see a guy with an ID I recognise him kya haikam Karta Hai Uska visitor ID Nahin Hai kids brain that I want to myself but was another look at that kids Green Card haiIQ Test Le Leti Hai Tumhara Apne Boss Ko Dikha deta hun lene ke bad hi call me to me the Station Head of that radio station and two days later I had a job offer so it's not about knowing anybody it's not about being a Bollywood kid it's just yourmuscle is everything coming together at one point it's nothing coming together at any point also which is that one trip you just need to Hit hard keep on go I also will execution you thought ki abhi karnaeven once you're an established person you can get very comfortable after you win Lotto championships believe that we have the same execution mentality that you have you started out that will keep your engine going between the inside you talking that is the difference between field that is the difference between football and some of the stuff I think Ronaldo is relentlesseverybody says oh Messi is good or Ronaldo is the good but in the end I know for a fact message naturally talented he had that Flair he has that Karizma he has that charm on the field week in screw with everybody is happiness while on the other hand you know the hardest working person in the room on the field has to be Cristiano Ronaldo play the differencewhy some people just rely on talent is great so messy side you know what they say overnight success Meri overnight success building record 18 Sal Mile overnight success Ki Ek Raat Tak pahunchne ke liye to while we know that talent talented why you are that talented aaega aaega aaega cal aaega per Agar aapane vah hardworking spirit bhi Aage to be Amin machine to Hua Jab Se Dil Diya Hai so you need to combine smart work and hard work and talent and thenSar khatm last question do is what do the next five years old few years ago in such a great zone movie of a coming in your doing TV what are you just thinking about your life orlook I want to break that notion even though I know I am Bolt I am I know that I am the most enduring border in the country there is nobody has used as and daring as this guy with that hairstyle I want to bring that notion and Shoulder projects on on my talent for sure and the next five years as of now a meanwhile digital has taken a different route all together and I want to be relevant and I will be relevant on that television will also come into thewelcome to hosting only hosting and their problem and one of projects but prince princess important is seriously looking at because I have a Theory it's I mean I don't know if I can see you have it that Hai if it's instant events also it's right now it's yuphoria it's every thing while on the other hand filmsis a different hai that you get in mountains that kind hi where you work towards it to crush the role of the mehnat kari hai aur FIR Jab ek second mein nikalta hai na that's a different hai so I guess I like that high as of now not actually doing it but in terms of metaphorically teetotaler known as it comes to filmsjust do that because I think this one scene when we were shooting 83 and 120 days schedule and you know mind you there are very big scenes in the film also like there is a monologue of three pages for somebody in the film but on the other hand there in one of the scenes I have two lines and Ranveer line is sandwiched between that stood between those two lines and I don't know where I get into the zone I deliver that line he says his line I look there on the other wicket I say my line I get outdo my short and it's of 4 and as soon as Kabir Khan is standard for 10 seconds and says cut everybody stands up in there is an Applause thunderous I have never experienced that that was a funny guy that has just showing my face on a stage where people are really fond of you but I am never experience that as an active but that hai what I get for what I got at that moment I want to experience more and more and moreand because it was a 120 days schedule for cricketers all of us and it did not happen with anybody mujhe aisa lag raha ke Kuchh To Ek chij hai jo maine kara kari hai usko Aage Lekar Jana chahie so because of that I think films are the future for me and I'm Never Gonna go anywhere from digital or television for you and to understandtelligence behind this Magnus I need this every six months episodesthis therapy every six months we are definitely going to more episodes bro

heart will talk about things that are not spoken about ever before anyone on the Internet to talk about self belief my biggest battle when we talk on mental health I do feel you should also talk about mental fitness that the ability to face the difficulties that life throws at you and ensure that your mental health is still stable while you are facing difficulties and after you faced difficulties you've got a mental fitness that we promote the idea of meditation that's why I try motivating all through thecast of work on your mental fitness but that doesn't mean that a mental health will never get affected the only thing that affect my mental health at this stage in my life and my self belief issues I have a lot of self belief issues I strongly believe that I am not accomplished as much as I should have by this point in my career and I know that completely crazy this too well established companies they were running this 55 team members were just growing your own your eventlockdown Viren dineout Veeran Godown in fact we grew a lot things are going really well in my life and I still I still sometimes just think that man was going to happen your from now we've even exist will be have all that we have right now now on the spot Kasam to talk about the past the present and the future why do I have self belief issues The Story of my self belief issues between feel you all will gain from that storyGhanta Birthday present what do I do today to actually deal with them I am not ok with the future that when the self belief issues crop up in my mind what my mentality how do I change things up ok the past I had mixed parenting my mum n me extremely close be done on podcast for the recently I've always been very very close is given me all the confidence that you witness on screen all my talking ability all is communityskills and just to general feel good positivity factor that comes through when I'm on screen when you listening to this podcasts from my mum was never close my dad growing up and I feel that completely ok waycool now but will not close the way my mum and me a big reason for that is fever to extremely Alpha people in the same house more so we were Two Alpha guys with extremely different mentality is one was an academic you respected the educationrespect the concept of marks schools accademia I am enjoying my life right nowgood marks I just under the impression that the truth but after the ninth grade I didn't study at the role of clashes between me and him and invariably and with him saying things to me like you want end up as anything in life you probably just end up as a security or somewhere or Truck Driver with due respect those job profile from a family of doctors and doctors kind of value the Academics allowed the value the studies a lot which also makes them valueconcept of studies Academics in general 58 isn't doing well you want to motivate him any how he thought the best way to motivate me to insert Me Maybe that works for him but that's not have leadership works you want to lead well if you are Alpha pack I do believe that you should talk to people in their language that the roulette follow at Monk entertainment that's the rule of all what we are biceps I talk to each of my boys or girls in the language they understand best insulting someone might bring the best of thepuliyamaram someone shoulder might bring the best of that person because median search work to identify them of heat on the tinsel should work with the attendant at the mix parenting I grew up with a lot of self belief issues on one in my mums why should play In My Head that you are the best you are the man your forehead confidence in my life but long term had a shit ton of self-doubtdecision I decided I am losing my dad and ensure that these thoughts of his become my reality affecting mental health for my entire life that's just how the human experience is the things you listen to in your childhood they become your rules for life the way you talk to your kids it becomes the inner voice throughout the allies are you get hold of this thing called implicit memories give an example of an implicit memory that I picked up from on my

or four years old your parents ultimate Gods if your mum so you dropping milk in the kitchen items get and cheese like dewdrop milk made this mess your three of the world they are you entire world NGO in the worldstop with you all the human beings and interface talk with you all the human beings being nominated the best of you can you associate that with milk and milk that's been spilt everywhere you remember the smell of it you forget eventually that this had happened in your life you grow up hating Milk but you don't know why I don't remember this incident coming that we don't remember that incident but all your life you grow up heating milk because you are sobilkul pure you associate the smell of milk smell milk and Warner Bros ask you a man why don't you drink milk hand woman is something about the smell you don't know why a feeling that we had a feeling that we had called and implicit memory later on in life when I started beerbiceps after Engineering College I got through college lot of confidence were also lots of lack of self belief and those two contrasting statements how do you put confidence and a lack of self belief in the same bagself belief means you don't know what you're doing your from now confidence means you are very confident in the actions that you take up today very different now in that he was growing up I just hold my dad kind of irony of through insults and tasted like an Alpha I didn't really affect me then later on in life when I discovered spirituality deep meditation deep spiritual experiences I had an Oscarwhich is a South American spiritual experience spoken about this my podcast with Luke coutinho extremely deep spiritual experiences you go back into your mind would depend your mind in some spiritual experiences you are actually able to go into Memories Never fade away now in a lot of The Spiritual experiences that I had I went back to memories of me arguing with my dad or SBI arguing with a few people who also spokese main school I want amount anything I just awesome status what you know you don't know what to do when life throws thought set a new head is like pressing the accelerator and brake at the same time you want to react want to talk the UK but you can't recall the older than with your teachers parents and press the accelerator and the break to get that creates implicit memory is a painful in your system sometimes and deep spiritual experiences you end of timecoronavirus releasing song new releasing some kind of pain you don't know that a man's opinion is a painful implicit memories direct toxins that gets stored in the system is junk food and heat burgers and fries you ingest lot of toxins painful experiences in life also meet you in just a lot of toxins and crying and numeration reading about screaming like to see that those Osho documentary screaming in your spiritual experiences that you releasing all this pain full emotional experiences thatall of us had painful emotional experiences growing up is called releasing implicit memories initially my spiritual journey at all I did in my deepest meditation God always cry after the relations at feel extremely light feel that kind of let go of this weight that was pulling me down I didn't even know what the implicit memory was very often by new release some pain if you went into an extremely extradeep spiritual experience we go back to those memories of my dad and my toes and one at a time and release them I'm not making this up and understood why heated gobi aloo gobi aloo is a Punjabi dish that I remember why I used to like one of the four old but all my life from the age of six or seven I hated it then I remembered that was probably because over a dinner with my dad we had one of those you know about anything conversationstyle associating negativity with the smell of cauliflower and the smell of Galvanic Saloni till today that my implicit memory problem your job is to find out your implicit memory is and that's why I promote meditation so much if you require self belief as a weapon to really killed in your career or whatever you know if you require clarity of thought as a weapon if you require a fast brain as a weapon that brain will become faster will become more cleo in love more self beliefable to release yourself of your own past and your past gets released due to daily meditation within a month to meditate daily for one month at the end of the month you see that you are a different person but was understand your own past if possible to meditate this process is definitely will be slow of you but maybe something that could help you is writing down your whole life I know that that's an exercise that helped a lot of people they write down the whole life with all the painwhen you are free dive that deep into your life you start remembering memories a new kind of blocked out but nothing like meditation please release yourself all that pain to your meditation keep in mind me and my dad according today which shall he was trying to bring me up in the way that he thought was best but just didn't work even today have self belief issues even though I know that ok is because of this it will become that deeply embedded in my head and eyein don't know if I'll ever be able to let go of the self belief issues that ok growth of the present what do I do right now to deal with these issues are I'm very aware of 88 action spirituality and spiritual progress happens when you meditate when you pray for your good person spiritual progress also happens when you take actions towards the goals you set for yourself and fast spiritual progress happens whenactions towards a goal at larger than yourself I know that this video so this podcast some of your getting healed some of your

the work and doing a spiritual at least in my eyes at extremely spiritual every single video spiritual progress for me but the core of this progress is reactions at a constant is Quarantine difficult to make videos like this after setup the cameras myself to setup the broadcasting equipment myself my cousin's behind the camera is pressing buttons have a team of like 11 peopleat the office you can't join me right now because they all stuck in the house is not easy to do what I do not easy to live this life and proud of me for that but not an even more proud of is that the 22 year old Ranveer promise himself that he can take actions no matter what happens is the best advice I ever got one of starting a bi a bi subject in Hindi words starting with I thought that why would anyone listen to a guy whose faith who is buffer is extremely report is not extremely steroid up his head at fiama coach at the time when she isjust start and tweak it as you go take actions you don't deal a big moment in your life like that you just work towards it the greatest flaw of most startups and most entrepreneurs analysis paralysis the think Lord analyse the problem on this study the problem a lot but it don't take that reaction that's what it takes that of greatness is built you work toward that you actually execute thisdon't mean anything if you don't do something after you listen to this

meditation would cry after those deep spiritual experiences when you realise that over it's my argument of my dadI had my childhood they are the reason I feel like this one in every meditation post that I would think about it and start beating kind of felt will be like a victim was his fault I don't blame for anything he did unknowingly but still affected growing up as a cry because I think why

add Mashallah spend my time getting information out of YouTube but in saying that I need a break if you stand up comic you can capture my attention one of them is a Rahul Subramanian is actually one of India's best and the comics in my opinion we don't believe me go check out the series of videos called crowd work by him by interacting with the crowd and he comes up with jokes on the spot on the most confident stand up comedy in the game so through this podcast but tried doing is that I have triedpracticing knowledge from his brain OLX communication skills tricks all is confidence tricks and of course all the beautiful stories from this man's inspirational life now if you use the term inspirational life and further we can get them there is an honour to have really not done anything this is of very humble guy he was the nicest human beings of mat in my own career was also got a lot of insight finishes engineering finish is MBA worth the top corporate job learnt about all those words and enter the World mediastand up comedy on life experiences that has got a fast mind so if you enjoy stand up comedy of you just enjoy beautiful Minds I highly recommend you watch this podcast Rahul Subramanian on the Ranveer show Rahul's on the Ranveer show bhaiya thank you Ravi it's a pleasure is great having your I have a tiger for thisnew idea what to expect usually I prefer a lot for my podcast you are not there is not much you why do some crowd work on me I will back I'll do whatever it takes man because I have to come out of this this podcast as people should see the sensor that this is the best podcast coronavirus that it will be now crowd work for those of you don't know is Rahul Subramanian viral videos that recently went on YouTubeoffices in watching this stuff like myself I'd be recommended to evidence was basically you interact in the crowd and on the spot coming out with jokes and all that I am I was questioned us how is over it on the spot because most humans had the skill Carriers or be flying V people's lives would be better and people with a lot more relationships in the life of a first for thanks for the kind words letter given from contact us for a crowd work is a if there is not a new conceptBook has been a subject of Stand up comedy enough to go to the best and most of the modern Indian standup is influenced by the best in the vahan per bahut crowd work and it's a legend art for other how do you get better at it but by doing it was any other thing that you just keep doing it for your mind becomes wired to know if it's so a lot after point of time for jokes just fall into head you know what will be funny you just trust your instincts and beyondand you know the Vibe of the place you know the audience during the person you're talking to you already know it's like a footballer who knows like that sometimes when he cuts your when Ronaldo cuts from the left wing in nose is going to shoot is going adjust the Vibe and some days you know it won't go and also with a mix of both but it's basically doing it over and over again like any other thing your mind is wired now to everyone who does it for enough amount of time you will become better yoube better than what you are at brother you know when Ronaldo cuts Hitachi practice that cut 2000 X in practical and I know you on a personal level I know that there's a lot of preparation you put behind your work is a very silent preparation for very like silent Hustle all kind of train Your Mind To Eating Out off joke 12 it outstudying other comics is soil yes I do that and it's not not so much to its molar ke requirement everyday I have to put I try and put at least some job on LinkedIn for Instagram for Twitter now I'm not on Twitter and because everyone is too kind that exercise is exercising your brain exercise your brain to keep thinking it's not about coming up with the best jokes on linkTwitter or Facebook to exercise your mind proud of this concern because of them so much stand up I have a sense of what is funny and what is not because you've done stand up to you know when all state what you say funny or not the preparation for crowd work with this with my sound very counterintuitive a stool not think of comedy the idea is to have a conversation with someone have a genuine conversations when I am talking to someone in the audience it's not I am not trying to make the first thingI am from Malad Malad passport am not trying to put that person down and generally trying to have conversation with that person and the secret is that I am in truth there is human to the more you generally try be interested the humour will come so that the and for that for media with genuine conversation with you the best thing is if I have had nothing in my mind before I start ok India with a good sleep before the show and then one by strong black coffee that's the best preparationSo Ja So that I try to do it is very difficult and I don't waste we talked with meditation and told me it's difficult to not think anything right so as close as I can get to that the better the shows will get to meditation in a bit I want to ask you bro it's so if there is a guy who is listening to this podcast and was I want to be witty with an account on an impressive device that can you listen to the girl impress a girl I don't think it isit is the only thing that you can impress someone then this is for you to discover its about not everyone has to be witty and it's also very subjective I am sure the lot of people of that way with more than me Lord comedians away with me so there is always someplace that I can go to if you like it at the meaning if you enjoy I enjoyed this I ever since I was in school coronavirus + part of place I was part of extempo elocution ZenI loved going on stairs and talking and being on my feet so it's part of this being part of me and I like doing it and that's why more invested in it and that's why I like to do it more like something hard you an account of my stand up comedy in the world know I used to where is annual honestly speaking I wanted to at some point Lekar 12 years back that was like I want to be acting as one of the best comedians in the world now my goal post has changedI have realised that with Lord of when you go to become the best at least in my experience you also lose out a lot of things like like I think the pressure to be the best actually take something away from your personal life from your you know the time spent with family the peace of mind which for me I am sure people who might be able to balance it much better but I have seen that I am not able to take in the pressure of Mina I like to play football I like to go for a run I like to watch my netI like to spend days every now and then why I am not doing anything so as long as I'm on stage and I am enjoying other people were enough people to come and watch me I think that's I am happy that we so and if in this process may become the best is fine but that's not there being the best is not then good bro I really wanna ask you this and this can be a little rude to some of the listeners and early genuine and honestyare you ready slightly so sorry bro okwhy is the Indian stand up comedy space is it generally the sainikon space all over the world ok so I'll Alfaaz tell you this I have to say about me I feel the same about few comedian so like a few few minutes I love talking to because I feel there so genuine and the SOA Suite Kumar Varun Anirban Dasgupta then Shreeja Chaturvedi Vaibhav Saathiya Sourav Ghosh I feel the same about them when I look at the I feel likeJayaprada I want to close to not sure if it's very toxic or not I but I am I know for a fact because I worked as a brand manager at work in the corporate world I know that any industry that you work with work in when the industry gross the competition gross and the competition gross it also possible number of people in IT grows and because of its you get all kinds of people and it's It's a tough job in the comedian is like you have one shot every time thatset it like you just remembered by your last game types Yo Yo own master right you decide what content is good you decide what you want to do what you don't want to do so there's a lot of pressure that comes in a dude I do believe that this pressure might get the best office at times and some of us at different stages of a comedian life might come across as root come across a selfish arrogant in sensitive but I really think the learning learning process everyone goes to the prosVarun handbook na Ranveer hamare pass koi nahin 16 x 7 years ID no stand up comedy as a profession existing writer for the marketing by which I was at any point is to get stuck like kya ho raha pata nahin so if so confusing is always someone I can go back to it done it for 20 years there is no handbook everyone's figuring things out on their role in that do you bound to make mistakes is the politics not as much as corporate work my comparison is definitely the corporate veil again I think is the function of howthe time comedy Industries still very young to the politics even if it is there is very college it's very nice college level political zero is very if the kind of politics that someone was worked in a corporate will look and feel like array and its its its more or less harmless is your expat experience is different is a lot of money in the Indian stand up comedy space at least for the top and 20% it is the people of started by PicsArtok I do I do not put a number to it because I am morning I am morning comfortably more than what are used to in my corporate job in MBA start working in the corporate Villa the brand manager in the year 2011 MBA job well paid and if I continue doing the job I would still not known as much of them coronavirus up because I started off at the right time I took that risk may be at the right time there is a lot of moneyofss intermediate everywhere these days Hero college shows corporate shows brand work everywhere we are there right everyone was to write script for IIFA script for Filmfare the hiring committee is the higher to write screenplay Sofia their Instagram with their influences live performance there YouTube video brands we are there so everyone likes comedy is low investment it's a good laugh like people feel nice after looking at condition or higher if you want hair band for college so you have to paylike the 10 people of the Bandra coupon all of them up to stay in 4 hours of sound check if you have recommended you just get that one person may be one manager one mic is also this is it legal to attend comedy performance so there is money because it is easily access it works well and that is there is definitely money because people are spending on it but I think that this part of the industry is going the top 10 20% and surrounds a lot and the like any other industry for any new carCoimbatore for every year to break through right drop coming back to engineering lovely so you and it was indeed a sandwich kind of two Rival colleges that did not know it had arrived in itself but I always saycall you don't learn a lot from the seller if you are the people around you with a mathematical Minds 11 or 12 Exam AVN thoda jugadu zoological so you learn lifeguard from them and Engineering C unity3d what does a my grandfather was any object to look and say OK what does this do how does this stand what inside my how is it picking up a sound and light how is it being transferred to the to the curiosity is a person how I live now because you see the whole world to the how and whyslightly faster which you can apply in a business with no line and worked a lot on the editor will be added in YouTube videos to Joga to engineering background that help to 100% the what do you think engineering added to your life but it's also true thatwe can't with nothing that we can plan to perfection your life mein and I think some of the beauty of life is that there is a level of uncertainty it's always better at hand side mein basa kar tatoo engineering and the struggle to pass examsstruggle I remember not understanding what I am studying what does Tribune computers ok coding decoding easier of that but I wrote the electric basic electrical engineering and Engineering basic electrical just figured I got to keep up Baba no no I got 40 in mechanics in the first sem I had attempted 51 and others have never been so religious I give my mechanic people will the result thatmost religious have ever but it did it features to finish assignment on time and I just ridiculous man that we have to do things which was used to run race against time ever the times when I've been awake the whole night just writing writing just to finish their own time underwriting actually just xerox copy like you why do we just kind of read someone else's answers and just copyright that was the work in engineering it taught you time management it taught us fishefficient writing work done Jugaad so I miss my I don't miss the engineering subjects but I do miss my engineering days does it give you any skill set for today for what Rahul Subramanian was doing today I'm sure it has a shape my aptitude for sure I am sure it has shaped the way I approach things my the analytical side to me what you like you said there is a bit of in protective leather is a sense of curiosity which engineering is slightly low sharpensI am sure it's done that definitely I think anything and studied SBI from School Junior College Engineering or MBA all of the map shape and Engineering is it comes at the sweet spot no you just turned an adult in the end of your team's you are generally you have that I told the main Kuchh Bhi kar sakta hun yaar main kar sakta hun kya and Engineering comes in like white ansuli to kar sakta and I knew make great friends and your friendship you broI am not done MBA and I don't think this is to be thing happening in my life I want to know what I missed out on a missed out on two years of adult fun ok bolo should I tell you what is the difference between engineering engineering engineering at a time when you just don't 1817 power and recall it also doesn't trust you to be added as well as your just come here ho kya pata you just taken the membership of all to takerestriction and uses of slightly crazy but when you doing MBA after two years of work ex by the MBA no one tells you that you are determined to taste of money which as an adult is great to have also the value car college life Mod what's your graduation and then you start working and stuff you miss collegenmbs like a second chances that which I thought that I did my best to yours I had I value it so much I enjoyed every second of it and I have money and there is no restriction select the best Resort experience ever holiday experience but the way and you know remix of brain develop does MBA to do that is a MBA Cup biggest advantages tears because if you when you do an MBA and especially if you'regood college what happens is the people you study with they are smart to a certain you know there's a lot of them are smarter than you the more you hang out with them you can a lot of things that what happened in my B I had so many so many of my friends and I know people study with me base Mata like so different perspectives and those two years also broadened my perspectives for foreign studies is concerned I did not study that much why did bare meinengineering style Ki Hai pass hone ke liye Jitna fighting game much from that but I gained a lot from my peers and Happy playing out why do parents take it would be like what is this vibrant just job security like what happening its for selecting exchanging is a very good to the previous our parents generation way of thinking because most of middle class parents have struggled a lot to get why are there so in their mind also the security oftheir children is so important for them that they don't want that children to be insecure on a state where they swiping MBA and Engineering bizarre things which generally give you some kind of safety net na that's right thing that were there coming from because it is driven by the context that they have been brought up front but if you see me now like Ravi want lipstick standard computer Sumit 18 year old 19 year old kids but taking a stand up comedy in HindiLegend profession for them with their parents also kind of ok with that which is great I couldn't of thought 1892 when I was 18 I couldn't even dreamt of doing something which is different from what I think that it's a basic science of packages want their kids to be secure life mein they didn't feel any issues they have job they have their own money at it coming from that have you had like that moment in your life that moment in the sense like when you are at your corporate Avenuewasn't you know you like it last I think I did it in my first open mic in 2014 but somewhere around mid 2013 se I was just get a sense at some point but then I MBA diploma college life to look after and this is it this is what I would do for the rest of my life so that is to keep eating me everyday and as like as not enjoy my work that much I will be sent at it but that doesn't meanenjoying it so you like oh my god I am I going to do this for the rest of my life that is to keep eating me that have a lot of people have been a critical kya think I think so but people don't quit their jobs it's tough to quit your job review will I get if we forgot the sofa look look at me now come from this background engineering karna Uske bad MBA karne secure job lena hai and then you go of the glad that said your whole life path is fixed itmanagement is fixed that something beyond that Tumko To Lagta yahi hai boundary and then you are the reason that so you are like very Kaun and if you are not enjoying the trees and then suddenly it's O my god this is I am going to be a part of this Race for the rest of my adult life very sad I don't even enjoy an ap is still complete it it stifling but you don't know what is the solution for a long time was feeling uncomfortable but I have no idea of what is the right thing to do or is there even a writingYousuf zulekha maybe there's something wrong with me I have to be more focused more I have to you many as a Thodi Hote yaar kam acche se karo kam karo improve kam Mein you try and find solution which are not really solutions and then you go after them go after the wrong goal post stand up just randomly happened when we got an opportunity to do stand up paddle and incorporate show people clapped and then there was a tornado naxali standard happened the first time it happened was 2014 mein main and I remember one of those days I hadI for job festival my mind was our corporate branding not for me you are you looking for an escape from what you are doing but you don't realise that you are going to escape that and get into another thing which will end up the Samajh Mein Nahin so I got place in FMCG company I got a offer and yes FMCG what I want to do that was my brain Singh know this I am not enjoying this because this is corporate branding FMCG marketing is well enjoy the ride conversation with my with my brother and one very closelook mine both of them were from the MBA background also and while talking to them they were like Rahul we don't really think this FMCG marketing is what would help you if you like this request in the because there was saying I'll not convinced you know I was just saying about things you know that I am looking for it but I'm not looking forward to the language do you really want to do it and that was a very scary because you know in your mind I don't want to put optionand you when you train no no I want to do it but I like no I don't think so and delegate job to Aate Jaate Rahega just take time in row over the hard-hitting moment letting your late twenties as an Indian guy I just the way Indian society is built the lord of financial pressure on a lot of Indian money pressure also think that not really because I was thinking money at that point was like a set of the MBA job brand management of PSU decently you had somefeelings and I will not thinking money at that point of time trying to figure out what you want to do thiswhat you want to do in Tamil pointed that out to you is very uncomfortable but that's when I decided I have to find something to at least at least something which I enjoyed forget money or something at least starts to have to enjoy that I stumbled upon stand up and I did my first open mic and was terrified was horrible like I said no to the job I did my open my pond I was so badab so bad that was self-deprecating beyond the point that I felt humiliated padela people drink lab and rightly so I was busy stammering stammering for 3 minutes away nothing funny that I

scared of it just embros to that that's one lesson the second thing I think the more honest you are to your cellauthentic Yeh and you and it got nothing to do with it being the right thing to do but I

about what you should do baby listen to them but don't ask for advice to it yourself make your own mistakes is making it takes so much 111 Moto I have in life is first do then think don't think and then do the same thing then think about what he said but not se do I feel like the actual executionwhy more than anyone else one incident ok this is during my mind I decided to take a train from

lighting ideas and if you know that hai abhi ho sakta there is no doubt there is no like ya nahin ho sakta hai na was a great place to be I want to ask you one thing that inspired me to start my own journey which is linked in my manager where as she told me that you should study Rahul Subramanian LinkedIn is holding a lot and I'm sure you can a lot of your career opportunities through that platform join LinkedIn and access changed like how it was somy mentor call Manish Pandey he was pushing me to get Twitter for long time when it is given to the same reason that you said that is to negative and is a great cricketershouldn't they do that without saree like growing organic a lot next up is Linkedin and a lot of my friends from the corporate world was told that LinkedIn is the corporate world Instagram like people always using little and the nature of the Lincoln platform is self education like self-help self-improvement ok how to level up in life which is exactly what my YouTube channels about my Instagram pictures what is what improving fitness Kariyo fashion whatever by a side note themost viral portion Lincoln Ave fashion post which is weird because it's a professional platform with your damn good looking so they also you will be somewhere they also like looking at good people good looking peopleauto liker Instagram YouTube play button link to use number because to study 9000 at least five six thousand the very very influential CS so we can a lot of Corporate opportunities we get a lot of brand used for YouTube and discovering a soft Limited nice is a difficult to learn how to play but once you do it just explodes known as you what you learnt about the platform and you think it's the platform of the future social media platform of the futurerespect my reason for joining link dir was completely different Eyes on because I had gone got fed up of Twitter because it was too toxic for me to toxic and I didn't want the toxicity everything that I deactivated my identity I didn't like I am not stop using I deactivated I like I don't care if my followers why don't we on the front of the void because I was using Twitter to post jokes everyday which is a metal x xkeep posting something on Facebook post that reduce the regions of suit and that time I don't around the time on my friend who works for LinkedIn he is just told me around you post posted this corporate joke on why don't you posters on LinkedIn you can post jokes online then you have for different it only for jobs in know it's like a proper community medium like you can post up status that we started as it were putting things because I Kahi na kahi To Meraanimals lives because it LinkedIn housekeeping at corporate specific bye post after getting lots of traction with letting the world know win over saying funny stuff that you know serious so that I think maybe put me apart and I'm liking the tension soil do more I kept doing it and it's fun I don't put an extra effort in the sense to ensure that it drives business but I am sure it asset I am surethat it has played a lot of people come to my shows because they follow me on LinkedIn I am sure a lot of brands have approached my manager and management live let's do something with row because it is having a structure X Factor like I was stopped by a LinkedIn top voices of 2019 will do that in an over-the-top voices of India 2019 and their 25 people list and guess what I was the officer was along with along withGuru Kiran Bedi all this like this type of having paid off and I could have never dreamt something like that I love something like that whenever the corporate world now it doesn't really honestly that it doesn't matter to try to be cocky very very funny with every interview that start withcorporate world that people don't know about but only the people on the inside of the corporate world no I been out of the corporate world for a while and it might be my what was a slightly outdated when I was there from personal experience I think there is very it's the high-pressure it's like the train incident I said everyone is so much like Aise dekh real life going there in with so much pressure the like what do I dojust going by every day without doing something wrong scared to do something wrong and their most people are most people are confined by like if you do things with your boss doesn't hate it's like the surviving everyday you not living every day that makes and so and the culture effect on cultural Upar Tu niche boy logo cutting lot of people are just that how they are going after like there's a surviving everydayaaj ka din theek ho jaaye ho aaj ka din jo jo Boss bolo main kar diya aaj ka din Koi requesting karna hai na koi kaam Na Ye extra just trying to every day and it's a cultural thing at it was during my time zone was like known give importance to other aspects of line and they just now observation all my friends were in the corporate world don't take care of the healthnot exactly like a lot like and general think I was very lucky my corporate branding job like a great team all my boss is to go ahead the gym everyday at 2 to 3 is to tell us 5 o'clock 5:30 are you like Rahul go in the gym normal get am working the kam Hota Rahega hit the gym take care of your self go for a run or something so my team was exceptionally modern or in that sense for most people don't mind we just too muchlooking too much drinking also that what I've seen in a lot of my friends in the corporate world even if you don't smoke or drink it's just that you know the true value for your personal life a new trend that way and that's what you pass 10 in that you see used to observe if you are an environment which does not value personal life that's what you pick up that's what you start 7 baje art with her work is important to get whatever it takes get the work that whatever it takes noit's just one aspect of your life work right now I can't take shows whatever it takes they will be days I'll say I don't to do so because I don't whatever it takes whatever I want you balance without I think corporate world mein lauda people after and I think the mentality is changing people at charges are becoming more aware of this year's spreading ki know that their culture when you have take care of yourself your health is also importantsong for me to say but I just like 90s kids healthy again it is little more than just a grown up with social media dude I don't know but I did my observation skit guys me and Ranveer Ranveer and I did video together the first and the matter was demonetisation a happy one of my favourite videos and in that run we should place the fitter meRahul the guy trying to get something done by the bank of sexy Hoke a jao you go under table when you push ups and then you covered there is very nervous and your dam kind to me on that day was you like it would you are beerbiceps I will be a lot of personal issues not the Yogi beerbiceps Suno Naself to do well in my career which kind of used to find outlet in the gym outlet in powerlifting outlet in abusing my body with too much wrong food wrong havelian angst about people go to the same thinga lot of that I think someone the vinaigrette themselves their personal life their health do we know that this is happening in the it is just like when you walk the whole day without being conscious about what is happening in the present then it's a habit and then is very difficult to get that I don't even think it's like those two girls fighting that they are just going by life no never take a moment to pause like ok kyaI will office Renault just to get a where I am in office no ok I'll go back home ke that also a life that is also important that gives me peace rup no peace of mind they just relax Nahin Karte yaar log iron again this is from my engineering college days and an individual at Ernst and young and I don't know why and very positive work environment I didn'tpolitics of toxicity you anything there was a lack of health for sure everyone OLX making all the time eating a lot of junk food all that the second aspect and so is like that everyone has given you tasks to do not that much like my boy is needed to be more work ok but the boys are very honest they were there I felt like they were honest with showing their own bosses that I am in office for a long time will come at 9 Aaram Se Aaram Se do work and state online clock when Ithe same book urban forest Bala given to PM 3 p.m. 2000 my of the nation again you can't generalize I'm sure that of course but there are people in the corporate world who are balancing things available for sure there are still people who are able to balance their personal lives their health and 2 in river and Asia Book but the number has to grow and I think the more we find a people start becoming take a hypothesisit will slow down here I hope that like 90s kids and late 80s kids also changed it like it I think it's I think it's taking a look at the brand's know the kind of brands that are kind of things the brands are putting out the ok making fun of themselves ok being slightly informal which also be sure freeing yourself is very free yourself you open yourself be more perspective right and then you become more aware and you do you know that I think that it's happeningwhat face only because I'm not part of the corporate you actually deal with lot of them I personally don't girls like guys just not my wife but I want to ask you because you been on both the contents as a creative + you been in the corporate world where do you see marketing in 2030dudh Mein edufy marketing I think branch becoming more genuine real winner personal laws and becoming that but also had everything Kai gold was then they would be somewhere to find a balance because some will be Ham to karab Ham to bahut bol Denge Kharab Hai To Humko chahie na Karen just to gain brownie point na Karen they will getI think I think they will use I think to use people more like they've already started using influencers in influences the role models brand whatever but in a more genuine may not like purana when you use a brand ambassador only for the face now there are actually finding people who are who exhibit the quality lag Ranveer Singh is a great example of someone who is flamboyant who is freewho does what he wants in a sense that and does not worry about doing the wrong thing I think so brands when they embrace them visa France who are also have a similar Outlook for you final question of the spot

temperature in Shristi Dixit known as the face of buzzfeed India today she is not working with mustard India is on the brink of launching hone big social media brand contradiction of course she won most intelligent most practical human being you'll ever meet your life Dhol conversation at least another class but in my super optimistic outlook on life and his superb practical outlook on life with top in the debate about a lot of topics from body positivity to fat shaming to physical health mental health and won the USB not know about mealso run on metal coating service it's actually a side business are running along with your biceps that I help people in my career I have people level up in life so the whole conversation and became a mental coaching session for Shristi and through the course of the coaching session she taught me a lot of things as well as intellectual conversations we done on this podcast and without further ADO will let you all enjoy the show make sure I'll give this a deep lesson there's a lot to learn about physical health mental health body positivitypositivity and correct Lifestyle things that the modern day Indian young person needs to learn about desperately enjoy growth is podcast on our podcast with Mr Ranveer Singh Misty Dikshit the queen of Indian social mediashort girls love it and some boys to so we can get deep into your mind from Kanpur and alllike self-deprecating jokes and some sad facts about my life but also jokes most enjoyable keeping it real but then I would be like thatcan I give you credit for something so when you left buzzfeed India I felt like the heart and soul of buzzfeed India top It Like It Happened because I was a big part of it would you say I took away the heart and soul but like I was lost to the company I would like to believe anduse time also little time for me to go and explore new things why did you leave again to bring your career like a new level I had worked for 3 years and I began as a Bollywood entertainment writer so my first job there was to write post about celebrities in Bollywood and then very organically as Basti does a company pivoted to making videos for the internet I thought that because I had a knack for acting back ineI love to perform Baton school so I just uploaded this idea with my height of an asset I would like to act and may be like write my own videos and also lets see how that goes and then just very organically casually not promising any like big numbers anything we just started doing that and it took off like it just even I was shocked by the response we got and you built a personal brand along like then there was Instagram then there was Facebookfriendly 173 ke I guess we like I also when I started a lot of other people around me also started and currently there are like 500k 600k million but I don't feel very upset about that because I have understood my pace of creating and being like I would much rather have peace of mind and like big numbers mental health status like right now before I thinkit's like very divided it's like my mental health is in many places I feel very calm in certain about certain aspects of my life and very shaky and uneasy about South number as what do you hear about the future man lakewake up in the morning and I think that this could be my last day so what have I done in this world you always thought that did not since I was a kid I used to think that the centre of the universe and everything is revolving around me and I will kill it in my life and I will why do you think that because I became a human being in the world was out and then realise that wait a minute you are not the centre of the universeand bad things are going down so like you never know anything to show like I think on the smartest people I've met my life my can I disagree with you want to keep that kind of like that and love for yourself because I really and B at January and we people like you but why do you think your site like that was it people around youjust like like crushing self-awareness and mixed with self loathing I feel how to get that I am telling you just by getting out of Kanpur coming to a big city life Delhi and then from Delhi coming to when you are growing up in a small town you are may be the best at everything and then you mistake yourself to be the best at everything everywhere in the whole world then you go into the world and you find out that everybody is just as good as you are may be better and some peopleuntouchable when you realise your true words in the world and you start questioning like yourself more than who are you and what you want and what is your purpose all the depot questions which I started thinking about some time around an Amazon college where I was surrounded by Brilliant genius people and teachers and just everyone everyone was I felt better than me for some reason even though everybody else around me was telling me that no you are also awesome so for me like it took very long touris that like someone else to be the best at something doesn't mean that I am bad at somethingjobs at Corporation all my job I think I have become this I didn't really like do much for it but if you didn't know that who didn't I don't know man that some like gap between what I actually done and what I think I deserve in life like it's a weird strange feeling of I don't deserve things that happened to me like I was listening to this song somewhere and there was one line with size so much loved it feels like a lielike a lot of time there is some disconnect between me and this person who is online and I feel like I am not this person and it's like a scam that I am running where I am lying to a bunch of people and being like all Italy but actually I don't have an idea what that isDubai your parents spoken due to water childhood in a growing up ok but you like my mum always always positive with near to me that I like it is always at sat in my head that I would say to that there is a counter argument thatbadhiya second important aspect of life which affects your mentality is the people around you in your $1 send me your teenagers and young adult so between the ages of like 1625 the people who meet the people who hangout with the most effective mentality I will be ok and I'll give your perspective and this could be slightly controversial but I'll tell you it is on a social media perspective you know so wellMichael Michael found on monkey my entire team of life 40 motivated kids monkey abhi like the select people based on the positivity levels only select positive people in the office and everyone feels like generally a lot of the people at buzzfeed have a negative outlook on life and they put it out a lot on social media and even someone like you do you like the face of buzzfeed but I feel like if you had connect people around you telling you your birth andsometimes you need a mirror in front of you to tell your validation from at I feel like I like this young 2020 you not got people tell you the schedule is it all I want to tell you that from the outside looking at your brand when I see Shashi Dikshit content pieces on Instagram on your stories my needed for this girl is so smart it's such fresh humour ok you are so watchable which is lightweight and portable growing social media so youractual Botal like appear but you constantly think that you are like that one person I have a question about this whole positive and negative Outlook what is the deal with black why are people so obsessed with positivity I don't get it because I feel that the purpose of life man like you gotta make the best of what given to you and that's the kind of focus have always had in my career that will be beaten down my life but everyone is used in life and have my jobis like a motivational speaker study like really successful people 1 commentary AC in all of them is that there this constant kind of urge for positive and negative things happen to them they state that hit on the move forward don't focus on the negatives like the difference is not positivity and negativity it is optimism and pessimism what's the difference between with positivity there is some kind ofstanding that you are always happy and negativity is like your always mad for everything is not the case what I would Aspire to be personally in life is to be more in optimist because I currently feel a little cynical about the world and everything in betweentrying out some problem of the other and not the solution but but he doesn't talking solutions to problems like give an example for example the whole ok dude I have grown ups no biscuit and I have been more than you can imagine in your life and understand that related contentok but I'm saying that there has to be a solution to the whole problem in the sentence do something about it because it's fine to love your body the way it is but also know that 10 years from now never keep your body the weight is right now it was a deteriorating rapidly if there is a problem problemproblem normalises it and helps people were going to the same problem lies are specifically with body positivity and Sakshi time it's not just that people are not doing anything about it sometimes people are doing a lot about it but still failing because of various reasons we may not know our conversation is that it is OK to fail it is OK to be the person you are you are not one Island unto yourselfproductive everything that happened so I will it ok to fail and it ok to be why you are also important to constantly strive for going forward in life I feel like our big Moto will be to tell people to love to love yourself love that would mean like I have to be comfortable with the body I am in right now I can't keep like maybe that works for you but I think some other people constantly chasing some goal mainthis may be an productive you know optimism is the outcome of a busy mind that something I strongly believe and I believe that a lot of the problems around in a good colleges all over the country usually the kind of slightly Pessimistic today 11 busy so I am I my Motto in life is just keep your mind and you don't you don't you don't have to I mean it's good to accept yourself the way you are to love the way you look at my face in the mirrorSheela Kaur role of sat on the side of a square field like that will bad girls in school with Seene Me Once your order has been a lot of man boobs and like my stomach and the girls in school but the immediate hold on what can I do about this and I feel that what can I do about this concept is what is bot in humanity this far in life to colonize Mars todaybecause you know where are you Ok what can I do but how can I go for that one more reason for this was just mentality in life but within your flight is mentality to a business as well and we select two people who have that mentality in the minds and vp of business has grown because of the people you selected with everyone is just constantly trying to get to one Level to run and worked really hard like Viraj and we have to keep the mind we have to be problem solvebut I'm not problem solving all the time but just do your duty well ok you are to constantly do things you can't likes it and if there is a problem that the problems in business and life the mentality should be like wheat what can I do about this problem problem maybe I'll give you account of how I feel about things in life is I would get like I would look at a problem and I would think aboutproblem which means that I would sit with that problem and analyse it not always will I arrive at a conclusion where I know that there is a solution to the problem and I have to do that this one particular thing to solve it but just understanding that ok that there is this problem we are going to work on it there is no rush to like that unlike you want to do then why not attached at the end of the video is it ok to beblack body positive attitude in the body of a device like the middle of the with the end of the video I will always have the solution it only the right now everybody knows which is 4 reduction is time so simplistic the like it is a complex problemprivilege like what is the background of this person what can a life to the have what kind of people are surrounded them what are the going to on a daily basis it can be very different solution is always there always know what to do the hard part the struggle is to actually do you know for a teenager watching that video OK when you and the conversation and in that ok yeah that's it in the head as like the final call to actionI would disagree with that I feel like I feel like the call-to-action becomes that you need to love yourself the way you are instead of Chasing some idea that someone else in the water selfie I am not saying you should lose weight for the visual aspect I am saying that you should just be in shape because that means of respecting your own body I am saying to do what you want and makes you happy that is the band and if you do so if there is someone who just agree that ok do you know what I am I love my body weight doing10-15 years from now when problem start creeping up on that when you realise that they didn't like 50 years of her life and saying this because at the age of 16 and gallbladder and gallbladder removal Bakrid collections on my gallbladder all my life I was told that lesson it's OK to be the way you are ok and then I got like this operation which is the most painful thing ever gone to very ok if you don't take care of your bodyto get six pack and not agree with taking care of your body and your mind is the biggest for someone who is not taking care of the body it is important not even if it is important to tell them the listen love your body the body positive keep your head that one year from now you want to hear a different position that you are right now in order to take care of the version of yourself 10 years from now and diabetes types of when 8 rightHospital bill Jagan entry mental health is really good at all then your family life affect you yourself images affected your abilities effect so I feel that metal is very important and mental health influences when I talk about the talk about being positive in all that stuff but I feel like you are talking about a person who just eats the ceilings and like there are no other medical issues to this hypotheticalhow to lose weight but can't what are that person do this is only feel it is not difficult for people lose weight but it is difficult to get yourself to take those steps if you literally don't touch desserts you literally don't in any process should you just do this two things at one Level this keep your body after 20 days walk around the house take take on a building a body changingGanpati ringtone way back when I was a physical training the solvent feeling focus on diets books on the Rise and just out of you deserve a process being mindful of what you are putting in your body basically eating don't eat like while watching TV don't don't just eat like you know and Lieutenant of abhi to be completely in your food ok I just dessertsmy argument as a personal trainer is that have train Mili like 50 60 people in my life almost all of them for weight loss and we just did this to change when you see actual quantitative results 56 kg is dropped like in 2 months so weight loss was a is actually that easy enough to sahi complicated by the vertical of this image of weight loss and very difficult weight loss is a difficult is difficult to get a safe or not by the packet of chips packet of noodles do not have that you knowafter ink not drink alcohol use a difficult things but this knowledge needs to be put out the ok but then let me pose another scenario to you what is this is a person who according to you is overweight but is fairly healthy very happy with the way they are dress however they want date however they want it whatever they want and early healthy but to you they are overweight then like do you think that this person is to change themselves it to his own but I'll tell youI have gone through the pain of a gallbladder removal and if you don't take everybody in the long-term 111 of the standards of light by the way it's taking very Lord care of them they laughed when you can almost but if someone isobese person you can almost predict like what happened in the long-term ok I have something to say which I have been through a lot of body shaming in life and end up losing weight come back with like some kind of fatphobia which is like this is the most painful hardest part of your life that you don't want to go back to us and youuse like I'll pitabali scared about like you like this is bad and I want to tell everyone in the world that this battle and nobody nobody do this which is not the same space everyone is at or is coming from so I feel like in that aspect the larger conversation then still needs to be about you need to be ok with who you are first then what you arelike what you care about and then from there I want to ok how do people look at me because even this idea of overweight and like is a bodies and looks I feel if your skin is assuming that thisMere hole Kariyo order like taking people online technically ok like to be a wise Epsilon and 99% of the people who are able to lose weight always come inside thanks bro you know you you genuinely like I've been that the metal where I wanted part to lose weight when I met the correct and trainers 11 a.m. at the correct advocate me when they got me to my health and fitness goals it is one the most beautiful feeling that was won most relieving feelings in the world for 99%what ise only 1% of people who like you like scheduled for the developer of your of light weight loss but I also feel for at 1% they surrounded by the wrong people because a lot of your own mentality is decided by the people around you and if the people around you counseling and good on you you you take care of your body good like you happy write on healthy at a good and you don't have any head but if the water is also telling you that you want good enough before I got the part 2it's not not good enough it's not about giving one of its about any time a person is telling you this trust me they don't care about what you are on the inside of what's going on in your body you look on the way you look better now you fit standard that was given to us by someone else and now you are great ok now we can get on board with this new great looking person and it is clearly telling you A terrible truth which is that I didn't like you before because I been that the wayLakme not be the case for like every human being that's the way your place even I am telling you are someone again who trades people who built surrounded by the world of fitness for fat person sees another person is latch on fitness back in your genuinely happy when you see if it were a person living in a gym an actual was motivated about the fitness Lifestyle will be very appreciated that person with an absolute take to go in taxonomy motor gym make you are saying that people working out at the gymhot in my head which is back all the active wear brands in the world for like maybe just some exceptions may be there but like mostly are centred around thing people already were already beautiful and then working out at the gym so in that scenario the person who is code and overweight or Photon code not like leg would ever beautiful looking available will feel very like a shamego to the gym which is like according to not not all of them it depends on the person some people look at the end that won't be which is a grown up visiting what is grown up with live news ways can he had left him saying problems and to watch like bossy bodybuilding back in the days or even just general sports just againvictim mentality is a decided by the people you to surround yourself with all your life experience and understandingactivity is a little different my mind negativity is again someone who is not solution oriented 100000 like the core of it and to again someone who finds problems in parks in a potential partly due to some kind of growth even with this Ki Baat and then does one do not do that you just the way you know like this is not it's not worth the effort that thatacchi Si cut off Dosti Pal my life is saying that you sense the energy of a person before you speak to you like thatGanges really intelligent analytical ok that's like to think that people can see people and this to the social media stories so even on Instagram account delete tell how much about a person through the post and talod motivation through their stories and this is a Career Coaching me speaking like right now at this stage of your career and I feel you have the potential to become one of India's biggest brands in the long-term ok I see you as like and Ellen DeGeneres kind of personIndia 20 years from now but you need to go back to your Kanpur mentality because because I just like you not had enough people in your life tell you that I am not had therapy also which is the fact that we also does the same thing Like A Mirror and like mostif like because a lot of times when you are prescribed for this is a question I have for you prescribe things to someone but like the same thing doesn't work for everybody to each their own lives and coach not not fitness but like a mental health quotes for someone like that how do you find the confidence to guide people this is also a leadership concept when you leading any kind of team ok byeMausami business coronavirus is to understand each person like deeply your noggin lead by just putting out of general kind of solution I have to do that does a youtuber because if my general solution having 90% population than that what should be protected majority but if I'm doing a one-on-one session for understanding City red light Inside Out ok and understand what your insecurities are what I'm wishing you happy what your past is ok and then I'll tell you maker also viewanswer the same thing as I would like to give someone as a completely different mentality I'll explain it to you in your words so and leadership of the boys are the same principles like LeBron James is the Big basket ball stop saying is that dude you can shout at one brother and I get motivated baby shower brother he want to play Basketball with you foreverMan Plus against do this with this could be the same thing people can take something different from the other side that is taken away like this person is yelling at me andin your hands you can do is like this and you should clearly with many Trigger warning you have to put out the most likely correct answer ok if you talking to crowd but definitely help peoplethat's my job as YouTube and other motivational speech in the crowd but lets bring this supermicro and talk about you should accept what's your what stops you from thinking that you'll become like The Ellen DeGeneres of Indiajust I am doing my time and like I am in no rush to be anywhere right now you are super awesome I am I am ambitious I would say that like I procrastinate LLB I would use a professional say that I get bogged down by a problem like if there is issued massive undertaking and I know that I have to do this I have to cross this big hurdle to get to point B which is a wannabeLeela Kovalam bite and like oftentimes like give up on why I will be a lot alike than I then maybe some have you had some experience life has not worked out and I don't know general life is being good is generally worked out in this moment we can you rewind back your mum who believe like that you would like some time I can't believe my life and I can't believe I have gottenwhen I was a kid I used to think that I will become Madhuri Dixit and like this like gorgeous Bollywood actor who is dancing like looking beautiful then I grew older and then body image issues came advocate terribly eating disorder in college then I

alikegoing up to hot women and like not even looking at you as a prospective someone you like it was not I was very very conventionally whatever I am sure that there are men who will like me and you will like in yourself right now know I want to like things on my body and I want this to be like thisI want my face to be followed by points to be like stopper is all eurocentric beauty standards that I am now understood that like I saw in movies and ads and in magazines and I ate top like I only bought into it as I have to look like this person who is just hot all the time you nobody nobody can be perfectbut nobody can be perfect but not justmain body look but every time you give it I will exert a body you would like 45 minutes of work in a week at the end of it the n-terminal Seth Rangers you

about how the time but I think about it a lot and to the point where I sometimes feel like what is the point of anything with youclassic nikhilism Neeli Pili the world so for me that becomes ill paralyzing in my like like in the real world any money to survive and go out and make money and whatever but this crippling feeling of how does also going to live for so many years before you die create an impact in museums in the universewhat we like during the covered like Chanakya Swami Vivekananda I am sure but like imagine like in the next Twenty Thousand Years the earth is dead then I feel like what's the purpose of human life other than doing your duty which is making the world a better place so while your spread happiness that was spread Manetaking money is giving advice is beautiful code which has that the the reason your born is to find out what you are born for and the purpose your born is to be able to give away that thing you were born for that I don't remember that use and I feel that strongly as like giving up giving away giving back to get up early for a meeting letsatsi 711887 school mein uthate Ham is not a real thing but I put the faces of the organisation that the purpose of my life and that's what we wake up everyday and stay positive or negative mentality into these four walls that each person everyone will be negative but if the leader bring the positive mind it it spreads I agree with that I agree with like one fish will poisonkind of situation like that happens like your cycle is not affect the next person who have you are talking to so I like being positive obviously has ever and I don't know like this I am kind of fun of you also and slightly jealous of you also like you just jealous of you just know that you have to wake up everyday

through my careeryou talking to you remind you that city Dixit your building one of his brother I am jealous of you stories on like Instagram I see the posted by see how casual you right and just make people are given to casual about your brand and I strongly believe strongly feel like it's therapy therapy will help me andknow what it is that is stopping me from going for it like I've known this for the longest path left for the longest time in my life that I need to talk to someone about the way I feel about the things I feel what what is like the most negative thing in your head writer at models were the causes the most pain what do you get nervous about when you sleep at night that I am going to die in significantly and It wouldn't matter and like nobody would like me or 173 ke people disagreebut like do the care that much like even with that number and I think about a lot and I am like do these people actually give a shit about what I am going through or what I am feeling for my happiness ok I don't know but I know I Logon new stories am curious what yesterday that shows some amount of ke not justI don't even more than you for the first time I met you told me that in Kanpur on a celebrity I don't know thatnot my purpose in life is that I still don't know what am I meant to do here that I feel very lost about kya karna hai apan whether it's not stopping you what's stopping you from keeping yourself busy I keep myself a lot of my being busy is like writing or reading for I watch it againI wouldn't say that by myself like that they were the team and therefore show multiple other people was the thought of those first viral videos with you mean that the thing you can do anything but the moviewe cells based on the actor actress photo of Karan Johar Ne Barbad old babytell me that I am awesome that are I get value validation constantly a lot but I don't know that this imposter syndrome on the ceiling of I am lying or I am coming which I saw tomorrow your which is like I no no no you are mistaken I would like to you will scam and I am not this person who deserves all this talk in your parents but like I have I have a little bitwe also like they are very very conservative that come from a very different thought and yeah I like my world is changed so like I've grown up but they are still there so a lot of things that wouldn't even strike me as things that are important they would like really deeply think about like aunty ne kya socha Mere Ko Nahin but they are thinking about a lotDikshit blood drawn to your brand this region Unity this year will be the goodness of Innocence and you and only be like do the court raise you got from your childhood and therefore your parents should feel like if we could give you usko aspect of who should read this will be able to guide you in this phase also possibly even better than the therapist I don't know I just know one thing that I am constantly lying and I constantly don't want to livegoing on social media like lying in my life even if it is to people like it if someone ask me how are you doing today my instant response will be I am fine all will be like it's never like a straight actual answer of whatever I would be going through and I also want to be this real authentic person you see yourself in her like it's I feel like sometimes in the Cham but I also want that shampooactually be the person I am so this person who is on if I need someone for insta follower of and I want to see myself as base see me but I I don't know how to like that handicap no I kind of know what you mean by this face very own right but I think than one Swaraj Assamese hard working together and I think anything fixed it for me was a great this Hasil is like Relivelihood just I think being a giver help me personally that right now because you are starting your own brand starting lecture the picture the thing when you get your first co-founder of your first people working with you when you start building your team I think a lot of your issues resolved soap possible and this is from my what help me if I want I want to know what you're thinking you tell me what I am doing wrong in like my lifeI think you are killing I feel like I don't know I don't have any advice but I would say that there is I can sense of certain militancy in your way of life is very hard to become the person you are and I get that I respect that but I would maybe want you to be a little more like just lose itRanveer like countdown like it I get it I totally get who you are you are my respected I am all for it but like you will get 4 tired your Babu don't like so much like I do this you that the same thing that I am goinghard life with black some regimented like 50 NDA type ka chal raha hai but I Hate Story all

Quarantine situations of the whole world is going to together the goal of my life the goal of starting this podcast and running this YouTube channels is to ensure that I can share all my learning and all my experiences with you guys that Y8 reasons the lockdown has changed my mentality forever the lord of my lockdown loaning which are encapsulated in this podcast in this video I want to listen to the whole thing because I do believe that the world is gonna be addedplease post the lockdown so you might get some business ideas through this podcast the other is I want to watch it is because there will be a worldwide mentality switch that come into play post the lockdown cause if the news is to be believed the next two years ago to be lockdown Aish even if you get out you probably have a problem ask you probably have to change the way you travel most people may not travel to one of manyunforeseen changes Havas worldwide pandemic and brought to us that why please loan from each other device should learn from me because this was the most intense phase of my carrier believe it or not social media numbers went up the two companies that I run beerbiceps and Monk entertainment of both in the social media space beerbiceps numbers shot up big time we grew faster on Instagram than we ever grown in a life we grow fast on LinkedIn Twitter beerbiceps is now growing as faris it ever growing we had a couple of your so where I was given by Sadaf attention to those fuelling management among containment would be a bi suspect up big time Hindi channel is obviously on autopilot is always going my point is this is world cup time for me it was a cricketer this would be a world cup time with that crucial for me to keep creating content and you know us see the video US Hero Honda you are no idea how difficult it was actually create content during this Phase I to train my cousin in usinghigh end camera lens hai and broadcasting equipment like this sometimes my mum short for me I just try to ensure that you guys have the best possible content coming away from my content creator friends did remote podcasts to ensure the content engine was running party to provide value to memory on is partly to ensure that my 11 salaries at beerbiceps get paid properly that would depend on my Hustle how many hours I was ready to put in how many videos are was putting out that will keep your YouTubecoming in that would ensure that I wouldn't have to dive into my savings to be able to bear the salaries I have emeritus at devices before lockdown we actually delivered some of the editing stations to the editors houses because we knew that this is the part where to go on any time in the learnings knowing the move one remote work is the future of the world remote work is very possible most industries are going to become remote that means you'll be able to sit at home or anywhere in the worldI am still go to office through your laptop that all you need laptop a good internet connection will be able to keep at it most Industries will work like this obviously for factories doctors list different but most modern Industries content would it most of the work promote this is a huge learning because it's crucial for you at the state irrespective of a profession to learn the aspects of remote work withwork The One Key factor for me has been task list second that Dino core concept of my entire professional life that any day of mine begins with the task list it begins with a listing out what I'm supposed to finish off on that day The Other aspect of remote work the figure a strong leadership identify the strongest leaders in my own teams are there by some Monk entertainment elevated them in terms of position elevated in terms of responsibility because it's a little crazy to talk to220 Patti ka dost you have to make this many teams within your organisation and elevates people to captaincy rows each person controls 45 other people and that's how the work is done for example Rajasthan heading the whole edit team he is in charge of all the adults that go on in my business team my creative head Charmi she is heading the whole process of what goes on other social media handles at Monk entertainment Viraj has four or five teams and him Jhalak as 45 team under hope is created minevery Captain is in charge of 4 or 5 other people and that's how the work is getting churned per come to remote work don't be strict about timings everyone has a unique system when it comes to working from home therefore if someone wants to work late in the night that ok especially in a creative industry like as one marital Akshar Tiwari actually begins work at 11 p.m. work throughout the night sleep at 8 a.m. that his best system that when his mind works the best that perfectly fine as long as wegets done and every single editor every single business profession and bigger biceps is listing out everything that they've done on paper so that the leadership course can actually see everyone's working at a good pace at home in saying all this everyone is working at a 80 to 90% efficiency not a hundred percent working in an office officer the efficiency is slightly higher and which switching over to this kind of mindset but as the founder of these companiesViraj schedule as well the co-founder of monk entertainment the big benefit for us is that we were talking with getting a new office space we are thinking of expanding the company now I don't think the challenge and more because when the lockdown get selected will go to office and we call the people who only required to be the in the office on that day he was a figure out which of the soldiers is fantastic with the remote work system who can work amazingly from home they can continue working from homethe plan going forward remote work has become a huge possibility it can reduce traffic problems in cities they are the huge thing that is going to do if that is growing opportunity especially the people from the interiors of India real talent that hungry for work to work in a Mumbai based company or a Bangalore based company is giving you that opportunity this is the right time to find your dream job if you think you can execute your skills while sitting at home second use your personal levelslowed the down because Mumbai is one of the city's bathing the extremely fast extremely demanding as a city you can sit in long car ride going to traffic jams it does renew a bit the lock town's posing everyone to be at home it's actually cooling you down a bit is forcing you to slow down the whole world has slowed down a lot of my internal battles with mental health with self doubtwith lack of confidence of Gautam sorted out just because of staying at home spending time

people as Aditya Roy Kapoor elder brother of Vidya Balan husband but I recognise him as one of the top Bollywood producers in India Today Siddharth Roy Kapoor has worked his way up from becoming a top corporate to becoming a top Hindi film industry producer is produced movies like Barfi like Jodha Akbar like fashion like Dangal and those round of a long list of iconic movies that most of us have grown up watching so this conversation was a deep dive inis complex minded all long successful Career Launcher lots that carry ok but what I love about this man is that is extremely articulate is got a very complex mind and he will take all the complex thoughts and put them out in the world in very simple words before but everything from the future of India to relationships to his own childhood ethics to leadership to how to create an extremely iconic and extremely successful legacymodern India if you or someone who chases greatness you should watch this particular podcast till the end the most beautiful mind of a country on the condition of worker and another gorgeous episode of the Ranveer show I am honoured to have you on the show today you need to be here we got Siddharth Roy Kapur one of Bollywood what I call legendary filmHero Super humble guy so he can displayed on the downlo.ad really really or not have you on the show so it's great to hear the business side of it is cool but my question to you is that all three of the brothers so Siddharth Kunal that your very like well-spoken people and let us see a lot of humility like radiating out of you guys so my question to you is that what went correct in your childhood because I personally believe that youPNB being well spoken maintaining relationships ethics are a huge part of Carriers so a group we go back to our childhood and just tell us about like What's gone right so to start with thanks for the compliment an behalf of my brother's is well and yes I would agree with you I think it does come from having had a very grounded childhood a very very exposed to the arts and Culture by mum she was a choreographer she was a model she is is a former Miss India she's been on stagesage of 6 and you know something as we always had rehearsals happening around us at 17 Subah exposed to the earth very early and I think you know just the grounding of having a really strong values based terminated by bringing that we did helps you in life and the your we have a wonderful grandparents we had your great persons that the big drop it so it was just I think all in all a pretty grounding childhood and not a childhood why we were you pretty much in courage to follow whatever Pursuit vnew restrictions on European free thinking free-spirited very open culture of debate and Descent which is always nice to grow up because then you tend not to reveal that much in your teenagers this is not much to Rebel against her and and appearance of very very open minded and you see the wrong kind of upbringing and precipitating right now with people you work wear to work around you know I've been able to call it wrong you know becauseas the room compulsions in terms of when they have children they are dealing with the known issues and therefore things they do might have an impact on the child without them intending to to have it but yes one I I think you carry the you eukaryote childhood with you well into adulthood and in fact I don't give a let it go because those emotions pressure was no way that if you has Khas then if you had a Satna bringing that is probably constrained you are kept you in a box that you act out in different waysgold my question to us when you see some people whom you know you feel maybe don't have the correct set of ethics for the one thing that sticks out you were just like that she wore it may lack of integrity and a lack of loyalty here are the two things that one that I know I I don't stomach easily I think is very important regardless of your abilities which OBC vary from person to person are the things that you have control over really a given how much integrity you can display at how many moreElite just integrity of being true to your job being you know not naupang corrupt and NIC corrupt I mean literally of course but also in letting corruption seep into your work and not merely being true to what you set out to do in the first place and second they lack of loyalty to the people who help you along the way because you know this this is a collaborative business and an effect anything in life is a is really a collaborative in their collaborative country yeah I I think human beings have to be calibrated you know there's no way to function without that and if you winlega by people if they've helped you along the way there are people that your beholden to then you know you need to display that loyalty to them True Lies and that's always going to number 1 hold you in good stead number 2 is a Sar I will be so this is like they know the mental makeup side of it like this what the correct and upbringing and other person my question to you is in the carrier of a person I personally feel and Mentos play useful especially early in your career with their first Boss 3 set the tone for the rest of your career so is it right to say the Ronnie screwvala wasquestion for you initially ronnies definitely be someone that I have a look up to you know from the time that I was a kid really because you know he came from South Bombay theatre background which I did too he entered into the space without any connections I was able to make a mark for himself was able to do very unique and different interesting and path breaking things at a time when there was so much units of government control of the media are there were so many constraints that you might have had as an entrepreneur but he broke out of that he broke into the film industry and was able toyou know create a Anish for himself as these are all things that I've admired all through and having had the opportunity to actually see him at close quarters in while I was growing up because we came from the same sort of media he was definitely a very inspirational figure in my life in the late of cosby my boss you know it was a direct you know it was a direct influence on me so I spent a long part of my career working with him and those been tremendously Aziz he taught me a lot but I and I would say that Elite padam see alsoI looked up to tremendously because again he was on the theatre readymade advertising his livelihood and he was able to much his personal and professional life so beautifully so he was someone again that I had the opportunity to actually be in place with him where he and she directed me and I had had a chance to be an actor in now in a fuse productions and see him from close quarters in the way that he operated Eso he and Ronnie were the two people that I really growing up looked at as role models for way I'd like to see myselfin place if someone can send you the interview done on YouTube you see a lot of the common saying into the actor Banna chahie tha itne good looking was that I was fortunate because I know you grew up as a fan of the Hindi film industry rabbit friend I wish I was one of those kids who read screen magazine and sea trade figure is the age of eight or nine read every field magazine I could get my hands on if there is any opportunity to go from movie shoot I be like salivating I was a completely you know film obsessedChamki growing up and I did that way to Britain in theatre I did a lot of Seattle to school and college realised in college was that I am over produces an actor and that's probably comes to the fact that I enjoyed being involved in multiple projects simultaneously and being involved in every aspect of this productions when I was putting a place in college service the chairperson of The dramatic society in college and that give me a youth racing sponsorship to put the place up figuring out what your Slate for the years we have a comedyRamadevi have a romance of figuring out which directors we should use how do we publicize the place Sona microcosmic where I was actually doing what I am doing today rack in college and I think that I realise more than acting or even directing which I did to give me much moreover cake produce some feel that this is the internal calling lucky people actually found their calling in life that everyone it happen to be quite late I have to say you know it wasn't like I grow up thinking I am going to be a film produceryou know you you know you want to be associated with the arts you know that cinema and theatre probably other two areas which you feel close to but if you don't literally want to be an actor only then it's difficult because you know the the term film producer is not something you grow up knowing what what is a film producer do you grow up thinking that is a person for the money into the film you don't realise that actually the entire set up of a movie from start to finish the way that it is envisioned bring out the artist onboard managing the logisticyou don't know that job so it is hard for it took a while for me to come to the realisation that this is the kind of job that actually I would love to do it easier for a cricketer of an actor at the age of three of the set the know this is what I want that's why I want to go but for me it was much more about wanting to be a media person someone who was associated with a medium that was able to impact people's hearts and Minds and I found that in cinema and and the theatre it coming back to your mentors again and it becomes a Ronnie screwvalawhat's the two one take away from each person that a state of you for the rest of your career tubidity to dream big and then make that happen you know in the year when I want to like you says about converting ideas into action and his thing was all about that he be like an idea and running with the same and that's something that stayed with me quite a bit and ideas only 10% of your work done 90% is actually the operations of that Idea making that happen but I thinkname is never being worried about being seen as a madman and being seen as someone who's got just this Crazy ideas and visions of what they want to do that has never been done before and that people will speak of it you if even thinking that you can achieve and then going on and doing them as a lot of people including myself when they begin the media careers they look at people live in se ok that's somewhat where I want to go you genuinely never felt that things will go this big or didawaken the bungalow inside water 2225 William Pitt 20 the difference between having a sense of self belief and actually knowing where things will go I had a lot of self belief I have to see that something that I've been lucky from 20 to from from it ever since I can remember there's been a fair amount of self belief and I would give all credit to my parents that because I think it's really that reinforcing and condition that you get is a child that you can do whatever you set out to do that helps you to be able to achievebut I don't think I would be unable to envision in which direction that would go I knew I wanted to do things that would make an impact on people but I didn't know what that would actually translate into God whats life like now at 45 great your your in your dream career you know everything is going well are you hungry are you great I know you are grateful I am so grateful but what's your mindset like right now it's it's interesting to it be displayedwhat is it that you want to leave a mark on the world as at the time that you leave it if you think about it that way and I think as you get to my age to start thinking that your that happy mark and now what is the next half way going to be able to to to do what are you going to be able to achieve the next half having gana the experience had all the failures and a few successes you know along the way what is that you don't know that you can now bring to practice and I think for me it's really about being able to createpieces of work that leave an impact on people's hearts and that I remembered long after one is gone now whether that's a great movie with that so wonderful series with that a piece of theatre you know something that I am able to help create and help bring to life could be someone else's vision it could be a vision that I have had it that actually leaves behind something that you know once once one is gone I think that the broadest way to look at it and that's really what I'd like to be able to do that content films web serieswishing determine the culture of like a country of the world fighting that's what Bible says about right now you are trying to play your role and impact on culture way and you do not as broad as saying that from at this point It's really a personal journey but I think when you look at it on a large or level the impact that India can have in the world with the software that we build instrumental in creating a zero down down the years the US is managed to make all things Americanexpression for the whole world from McDonald's to Disneyland Coke to hamburgers to aid to the American way of life Broadway you know these are things that the whole world aspires to has been something that they want to be a part of and that actually helps in raising the profile of the country as the preeminent dominating cultural and the world the Hollywood is managed to go into every country and decimal the local film industry and it has become the de facto filmthe country have very few local language movies be made on the World India is the one country in the world where we have a thriving local film industry and a culture of our own stars are own stories on concepts Hollywood have a nice to make a Dent Theory on 10 to 20% of revenues to the last 60 to 70 years or more I think we should celebrate that the massive cultural advantage that we have we have a massive South Asian diaspora in across the world Indians Pakistan is Bangladeshi Sri Lankan around the worldlove our content in love a cinema in love our culture and I think you were able to broaden the Horizon and become an aspirational cultural forces of the world that actually helps raise the profile of the country you know tremendously and I hope that the government are increasingly recognises this they have definitely shown signs of doing so and Euro helps the Indian culture fraternity to be able to do that so so I strongly believe that because of the size of population andeducation the spreading because of things like YouTube I feel I will be the winner of very different India and save as soon as 2040 or 2014 very different do you think that the role reversal happened why Bollywood will be impacting you know the world in the way Hollywood is impacting the world today using a good happy I think it's bound to happen because we got such a rich array of stories in a culture whether it's the mythology of whether its history whether it's what happening today in in our culture to tell the worldand if you just example for feel like Dangal right when we need Dangal we had no idea that it would do the sort of business at it in a place like China because Dangal is a film that is so local you think it's a little Haryanvi family so culture specific and the trials and tribulations I will go through in the patriarch of the family realising the importance of his daughter's but the fact that it could resonate in China means that actually what it takes is trying to be as local as possibledusra the story that will country reason it elsewhere because this is some truth in it this is some authenticity and truth in at the moment we try to reconstruct ourselves to fit what we think they will like I think that's why we feel we need to be very true to our own selves and what comes from US and that's when I think people will see the truth that coming back to slightly more personal conversation for what were your failures of your 20s that likes it or failure because I possibly 26 Augustlife is a perspective of being 26 what are the failures in your mid 2012 ok that kind of help me construct my mental makeup photo this so many to choose from where do I start stop I don't look at the mess failures I saw you look at the maze learning you know because every every thing that you go through life actually helps you moving forward you I'll start you know that when I took up commerce as a subthat you know I want to study I had no interest in commerce whatsoever I was an art student all the way like there was no question about it because I did very well in my 10th the pure pressure around taking arts at that time was so intense music only women take it and if you are a failure than than you and others like it but I thought I'd enjoy enjoy literature enjoy history and joy in a sociology in those are the subjects that I think I gravitate towards and the irony here is that my parents by encouraging me to taketouch your your all about but I think the pressure of wanting to fit in and wanting to be part of the crowd also maybe not having any other role models in terms of an elder sibling to be able to go to who would be able to guide me in that direction I just made me follow the herd and I took up commerce while I love signals a college I had had the greatest time there I was part of the dramatic society we had a wonderful extra-curricular you know your situation going but I have to admit I am$10 20 lectures in 50 literally and you know you just got by those at five years of a wasteland education then of course I am very grateful that according to general Bajaj and it my MBA but it was two more years of studying things that I didn't enjoy it gave me the security of their for getting a great job in being able to be positioned well in terms of you know I just your security in life in terms of financially but it was there I swear I regret my academic career2 7 years I spent studying things that I did not enjoyed a lot of kids watching the saying that wait I want drop order Siddharth Roy Kapur saying that you know him in his academic career I don't wanna do this but not it's about doing what you really enjoy it I think I've been you know I've been very fortunate in even despite that being able to have found my way back into doing something that I that I do enjoy the probably the journey from Arts into movies would have been a different kind of journey but who knows if that would havethis is all you know 2020 hindsight it worked out in a way that I would have wanted but I probably didn't spend all your studying something I enjoy my my my my only advice if I had any for you know the younger generation is your spending the seven crucial your 57 depending on where you do a postgraduate degree or not just study subjects that you enjoy and that you know that you are good at and that you gravitate to others because I feel that work ethic ethics in life and just having a vision kind of makesaur not having the appropriate degree in my but my perfect now according to the modern world it that whatever you want to do in life it is possible if you are some amount of self-awareness and just that promise I will work hard and I think today the other thing is that for your generation and and the younger generation the vocational courses available today not having to follow the straight and narrow Arts Commerce science and we had to a tremendous to take advantage of that because you can actually be able to you knowacademic journey in a direction that today is much more specific rather than just three broad St Ann's keeping entrepreneurship on one side of Kailash not about Roy Kapur films let's talk about your corporate career what did you do correct to break out of the coronavirus people promote you to become like you know the chief of marketing of things in the CEO of Disney MD of Disney think what did you do right at what do you do to break out that it tough question for me to answer myself but I'll take a stab at saying what what I want Itry to do what I try to do in my career was number one work really hard and I guess that happen because I was enjoying it I was really like I was doing exactly what I wanted to be doing when I joined your TV that was actually the age of 31 m from Star TV remote UTV because it was movies and it was television and animation all those other things as well but it was a Alto I enjoyed it was the the spirit of entrepreneurship that I enjoyed around me and I just worked flat out in the URLbecause I think what Ronnie managed to do was was faster culture of entrepreneurship way you could debate decisions with him quite free deals on them change his mind based on a strong argument he would encourage you to take risks he actually valued you know risk-taking abilities he also if he was entrepreneurs within the company of possibly entrepreneur and of course are you know monkey Paytm in the end of the month but it was almost like making you feel like a sense of ownership over you know the organisation whichvery valued and that helped get you working it did it did anything up the harder you work the luckier you get you know that that that I think honesty is the is the one philosophy that I have you not taken away from my my ears in in this industry and nothing is true for any of that you know luck I give very less importance to because I I believe shop definitely there are sometimes factors that work beyond your control that put you in a certain position but I think if you keepvery hard and with integrity the likelihood of you being in that spot at that time is at much higher so I'd say it was one thing then it would be hard work you know I will be from two different generations you like one generation before mine and I call my generation the bonnet generation because too much social media options to do so many things that you cannot get confused about my Kya Karu like me that a lot of people with mental health issues mindblue xx sex problem not found the Bible life and then not able to actually worked hard right not what you message to them other than the fact that choose a career that you'll enjoy possibly have done that but is still kind of struggling with putting in the world you know to start with I have a tremendous amount of compassion for for the generation because it's true that it is bombarded by messages 24/7 of all kinds about aspirational lives that they think other people are livingthe pressure was tremendous every generation feels that it Encounters at to some extent but I think it's even more amplified as as as a user going by because of social media so there aren't any easy answers here I do think and it sounds right and it sounds cliched but the one piece of advice I can give is to just follow your heart because your pressure can be so crippling and it can be so misleading the order that created around imagery Lifestyle that you believe peoplejust no that's not true just you know about the highlights of the highlights of the curated you know that the curated images of their lives that they hope they put out Dil HD feel good about themselves probably not realising their impacting generations of people who are seeing those and imagining the lives of so much worse than someone else's but you would have compassion for everyone in the situation you know I'm doing it to hurt someone else would invariably that that scenewhat happening but I think I just about following your heart in terms of I think we should listen to the device inside us we know what we really want to be doing and Meenu the right we really want to be living is about just assuming that and not getting distracted by the samachar realise that you think everyone else is living have you dealt with any mental health issues not enough I mean not know where I can say that they've been playing on the wind debilitating thankfully but we all go through periods of timebelow and we feel you not impressed hold up even right now like right now at the age of 45 show absolutely I do the Never Goes away and if it doesn't your clearly closing yourself or nothing yourself to your feelings because it unnatural not to feel over to feel depressed you have a flop you feel depressed you are not able to cast of film you feel depressed or something doesn't go away in terms of script not working out like you wanted to feel depressed or BC things at home happen 52families you feel depressed Amin 2009 things it with a job experience of wealth in ever go away and don't don't imagine that they do because you know UB UB imagining a future that quite different to the reality and would be quite disappointed with that but I think the recognition frankly that I had also that sometimes people can have clinical reasons why they feel in a certain way which are not related to what happening around them but related to was going on inside them and then for peoplenice that that's not something that I have experienced but I know people around me who have and I I know people who have and I think earlier it was just looked on as being there in a funko there in a mood or they are Modi or they are you know there's nothing wrong with my don't know why they always cribbing those are things that could still exist with some people are not it's on black or white but there are some people who are described themselves and despite whatever else might be going through feeling that we because there is something chemically happening inside them that making them feel like thatand try to realisation I've also had over the last few years it's not something that you could know if it's not happen to you but I would advise anyone who's going to that to actively seek professional help because there's nothing wrong with you are treating other parts of your body the way that you would in a scientific manner your brain is as much on organ of your body as as any other why would you not read that if there is a problem here so I want to talk about self doubt it's something that you will see a lot social media see alot the way you said that you know Meri or flop kind of message with your moodAnnu producer but I ran my own mini like YouTube channel and if you have a piece of content that we are expecting a lot of fun to use don't come and people don't respond well definitely of at me but what I have to go to over time is here come out of this Funk in the past as well and if it's kind of rhi h that kind of formula that helped me in the past is at a parallel to what happening with you right now the if there's a flop you do get a liberal Sealdah Bade wale ok I'm old enough now to like the way they're actually wouldwhenever there is a setback it could be a flop it could be something not working like I wanted could be personal could be professional is a try to go back to source a mean one is I will learn to acknowledge it I've learnt not to brush under the carpet and just tell myself you can go on there is no issue and to block myself to a table on to experience it let myself feel that way you are allowed myself to grieve whatever it is that I am I am feeling number 1 and number to word always helps me is really going back to sources of inspiration once again to motivate me like it could beit could be a book about someone I admire it could be a I could be a biography of to be an autobiography of someone that I know will give me the motivation because I know that they have spoken about situations like that they've gone through income through it could be watching a great movie that I've always been inspired by it could be just going on a short break but allow yourself that and be kind to yourself in that way because it's only that I will get you through it in the movie forward and I think this onlyjob time and age and experience when you realise what it is that works for you to draw you out of the situation but I think the biggest thing is to acknowledge it to start with a very often without you Jass dust yourself off and pick yourself up and move on that great but do that only when you dealt with whatever it is that you've experienced rather than just brushing the corporate because it's there in some process of your brain is going to come back to bite you at some point if you don't even then can I see something personal show when was the last time you cryI cry all the time in movies I am a very easy very very easy crying so I want to screening of film last night I can tell you which one is unreleased and I tried so ja last night but does life of me to try to show what what specifically I think if there are if there are situations with loved ones that you are going to that you know you you feel helpless in it could be anything if you are you know if you are going through a period ofyour life your feeling low about something but I've been someone who's actually with my near and dear ones were my heart and I see fire pit so I don't find any issue with your letting out there in and crying with you need to you can do it in your own bathroom in front of the sink or you can do it with someone that you trust and love and You Know Care About but I think it's important to to deal with sadness and to deal with a low period and give yourself that limitit collects inside you are my question is coming back to those movies in the content pieces that help you could you name a couple of bucks a couple of movies and hopefully a couple of YouTube channel that you watch so I am really have to say that I am digital not a digital natives the opposite of VK digital dative a diet at looky looky Soya I can I watch a lot of YouTube videos but I have to say I don't follow any YouTube channels I will be following years after the Sangamovie so many so Sholay Cinema Paradiso you know these are film like I get Cinema Paradiso is about the movies and about just you know it's Italian so there's a lot of very open emotion the whether we like it in another films that software that can get me you know laughing and crying every time I see at Sholay just because I think is the best you know Hindi film ever made immediately that I think it hadbeating the Hindi film good quintessentially have it's the perfect if you had to tell someone if the term Bollywood had to be put inner join and had to tell someone what's the quintessential Bollywood film then it would be that it had great music it had action it had emotion it had Romance had a wonderful villain it had great heroes you know it had laughed at her tears it had everything that you could probably ask for and that's often that you probably isthe most growing up then Amar Akbar Anthony complete Bachchan you know field assistant Allah most people of my generation are but any Amitabh Bachchan movie from the 72nd Itni going books it problem movies of Ammy Virk Sab out you know people from the movie so there's a book called the boy under which following hallberg he was the boy wonder producer in Hollywood in the 20s and 30s he founded MGM with bill Maherany right A37 after making some of the most incredible movies of all time then I read this book on the kids in the picture but about about Robert Evans who is the legendary producer email Godfather China Town Rosemary's Baby you know some wonderful movies and just about your money when you read about him you realise that people in the movies go through similar things regarded as which part of the world there in the apps that down the incredible Hai is incredible lost so these are the type of books I would readwithout water time anyone is feeling like in need of inspiration but there are so many so what was the one single moment of area where you located in your life that was my lowest moment Kariyo Kariyo voice the irony is I think it was when I was with started in Hong Kong I was actually at that time the youngest vice president in Star TV in initial I had this what people think would be a dream posing to Hong Kongfull city all all that was great but I genuinely felt completely underutilized at that was not the fault of the completeness of the what the situation was that point of time in terms of you know that not being that much happening at the other head office versus what will happen in the other areas and I felt completely underutilized I'd have literally 3-4 hours of work day and the rest of time and I just have to spend whiling away has wonderful Aaj office overlooking the you know that Hong Kong Skyline crucifersit is everything on paper tick all the boxes but I probably felt the lowest of it in my career then and that's when I will solve interacting with running athlete in touch with them over the years since it and that I did my internship at UTV Anni se why didn't you come back in we just bring it often called Rang De Basanti and was going hell for leather with this movie studio call UTV Motion pictures plan to do a lot a comeback in head marketing to the studio and for the rest of the company and I think I would literally on the next right back and Bombay andit and it that was probably the best professional this is my life taken coming to current mood in life once again I am not thinking mind especially for coming to your current state of mind this something I want to know on a very brotherly level we spoke about crying and the things that make you cry personally at this stage of my life and my twenties and feel like my 27 set me up for the rest of my life and kind of always look at myselfthe leader of this organisation of luck beerbiceps Monk entertainment at the one thing that gets meet your top occasionally a may be loved ones on the something is a Lil bit of the burden of leadership both in terms of the monkey and the advice of Hero and then the five million people following on social media because there is a lot of responsibility attached to your face to your identity in terms of leadership what you are advised that will end up is the process for potential leaders of the future againso individual and so driven by how you are as a person that I can't see this one-size-fits-all advice for someone but I'd say probably find opportunities not to take yourself so seriously you know why not find people around you whole who will you know joke around with you probably make fun of you are you know indulgence self-deprecating humour friends that you don't from way back probably who treat you like a kid and you you can haveceiling fan with them to just sort of let off steam in that way because I think it's really important especially when you are in a position leadership because your feeling like you are being watched all the time for your reactions for your for the weather you behave and I think it's important to give yourself that pressure cooker situation to to is direct x and spend some time with people with whom you can just be completely or silly self and B as stupid as you want to be cracked ridiculous jokes and just you know so I have a direct connection to the energy that becauseI think you come back refreshed and then you can be the role model that you want to be to do you know the people around us if you put on a pedestal you must be doing something right Osho know for sure and it is true that you are that your that the way that you behave with people is being looked at as a signal for the culture of the organisation and and and it's true you can't deny that so you are under scrutiny all the time if you choose to be the position of a leader and you should enjoy that but that doesn't mean that should become your whole life is very important to allow yourselfare the time outside to be able to be the person that you just want to be when you let your hair down so so they say that you know maybe the last 20 years were about all the signs degrees at the last fifty years over all the signs he's been in the big money being the big businesses all that and this is the next 50 years ago about the creative industry where creative professionals and creativity is going to be like the highly monitise human trait my question to you and this is something I have experience as much as I love my Ho loginI love you di family culture your leading creative people is it only M30 lead business people creative people all worked out of a place of emotions holi games in design and know that this is a new experience specifically when it comes on leading creative people setting a big creative business what is your advice I think you're dealing with each person in the way that you believe will bring the best out of them and not having horses for courses approach in the way that you deal with themsome creative people were extremely organised an extremely methodical and extremely and and want to be dealt with in that manner and like being treated as a working in a bank that could be the most creative people on earth but they enjoy deadlines enjoy you know method their production runs like a well-oiled machine and then you deal with them in the manner that they like to be dealt with but you could have some work complete creative Mavericks and who got who just completelyrun with the flow stream of consciousness thinkers will not put anything down on paper want everything to be on plants that it can be spontaneous and can be live in the moment and then you have to deal with them in that manner to but as a person who is running the ship and who is responsible for actually commitments you need to then ensure that you are able to build a world around them which gives them the chance to be as creative in the way they want to be but still within a Framework that make sense for you so you can then run wild and saying allfrom trial and error this is something I knew there was born in definitely is not it's actually something that come out of many as you put it failures right that have maybe learn that it's important to be able to deal with creative people not in a one-size-fits-all approach lawyer that it is something one of my biggest Riders LeBron James also said that each guy and his team is a big NBA Player install on them individually before actually getting the best out of them so know yourOsho my next question to you is great this is your family this is your inner leadership advice sir honestly from the outside your one of like the biggest people in the Indian Film Industry and I'm sure that comes with a lot of bootlickers lighting u i am solid people like suck up to you and all that two questions first question is how do you identify who is being nice to me to get something out of me and the second question is that what actually you knowwhat makes you decide things about a person on the market this person opportunity and I want ke bad person opportunity I don't enjoy yes men at all so I enjoy someone who is willing to put themselves out there and have a debate is willing to have a different point of view be that an employee be that a writer by the director be that an associate on a business level I think we all have a pretty good enable should read a built-in to us which can tell if someone isgreen to everything that you say accepting everything at face value just because then it's quite clear that there in it for the ride rather than to actually be able to have constructive debate and argument and and move forward so as you again with age and experience you probably are able to detect people like that quite early and the only thing could be as you know don't brush them off in a way which will be hurtful just be respectful but in your mind know that you know this is a problem of the people that you wantuse it with professionally and what gives you the green light on a person exactly that way someone is debating the issue they aren't making it an ego issue with making about the issue right so like I'll just give an example so writer for example you can tell very easily for writers close to any feedback because then they just shut down you can also tell very easily for writers accepting every piece of feedback then you know that then that there might be a problem or otherwise your so brilliant that you should not presume thatbut sometimes when a writer is saying that a great point and incorporating it began arguing quite vociferously with you about a point that they are quite clear on why they've done and are able to convince you about that are able to get convinced that the 2016 people like you want to collaborate with because you know that it's all about the work is not about ego it's not about full full acceptance of the person who is paying the bills so it's notother extreme it is great that says example of a writer but I've seen every so therefore every person that you're dealing with if they are having a constructive negotiation argument with you about an issue instead of about things extraneous to that those are the people that you want to collaborate with 2005-2006 will be released in Jan 2006 for 13 years and yeah you work to the lord of Se Bollywood stars with the starsIB tantrums or you might be that glam quotient I am sure you had some experience is dealing with the added over someone's whatever kind of Stardom is going to the head as the guy on the business side how do you deal with like things like that as the leader of the industry what's your experience dealing with that I think two things one is that if you can just remove yourself from the situation sometimes and located from the outside it helps us give you some perspectivenumber 1 number 2 have some compassion for the person and then deal with them in that way you will put yourself in their shoes put yourself in their shoes sometimes you might put yourself in their shoes and see why am I having so crazy but I think it's about understanding weather coming from and trying to alleviate because you know if someone wearing that it comes from insecurity when you think about it deeply if there was security they would not feel the need to behave in that manner so to get you theinsecurity might be and if it's your power to address it then a dress that rather than dealing with the symptoms of the UN Security which is this behaviour it like a man can you give one example of story without taking names why you just ok this is how the industrious Innova just opened up about things like this there are many actually that there are many have been times that one has been threatened 7 x 71 is win not literally abusedyou know shouted at but I think it just really depends on the people that you are interacting with and how much you want to what you think that you can do to be able to have a collaboration that makes sense to me that I like to look at it also is that we tend to presume that relationships are friendly or a more casual or more informal or becausebusiness if you're working in a manufacturing company Aurangzeb and you have college with you you be collision with them at work and you would both collaborate and get work done a problem is that we spend 24/7 together we are interacting in informal settings where having a drink and working where you're not everyone turns to believe that means you must be friends I think don't apply the same principles that you would apply to a friendship to a relationship with a colleague understand that yourthis in order to get something done right along the way friendship developed that great but you are calling your professional colleagues to try to deal with again just focus on the issue rather than focusing on the behaviour at that we've always try to don't direct practical approach this is like important as a producer to wait to be pragmatic and to just try to figure out what your end goal is to acchi to make a great movie to make a great piece of work to deliver it on budget on time in qualitybe the best platform possible anything that impedes the process deal with without landlady motion come into play at times it's important to lead emotions come into play also but those times and that come from a position of not having any other illogical response to the situation other than that so when someone is in your kind of driving seat at you are you are a lot of powered create especially actors actresses Carriers you know you can that have people perceive the old school author of Bollywood producerwithout asking you details about that I want to ask you what are the treat to CNC a young upcoming actor actress ok this person can be a potential da cause I'm sure that the path has its own challenges and all that but what is the basic mental makeup that you look for other than OBC being a good actor good dancer like on human body look for OBC things and hard work and commitment and you know dedication and all that the nationalism your professionalism just generally being someone that everyone wantsawkward because of how there is dad X Factor that we can't deny this is show business this is the film industry this is all about that indefinable quality that draws people to someone magnetism and I think other than just got talent it's important to be able to recognise that not everyone is got their ability to do so I don't think any of us can claim to have 100% track record when it comes to that ever but it's just taking a chance on someone who might not be the best looking formight have the best dancing skills but might be someone that you are seen some some quality in that is need some in during on screen and the camera loves them and they someone that just shines through whenever there on screen so thin definable it is indefinable other than this magnetism what have Shahrukh Khan Ranveer Singh Salman Khan your the right at the top MBA + solicitors what are the done character in the life I think they've just taking chancesfilm se data may be taking chances are they we're taking risks they have been able to put that talent out there in a way that actually exposes them to failure and those and these are the times that sometimes had a massive processes sometimes if the field as well but they give back their own conviction and back their own talent to do things a problem others would do so so when anyone speak to you of anyone with a very complex mindlot of experiences while I want it comes along with having a complex mine is also being a perpetual learner like and I see that a lot and you that you are still at that stage 1 level the first time at your office you ask me a lot about like social media is a new world for you what is like you know the next 10 years like for you like what do you want to learn next due planet like that for example right now in a stage of my life I want loan personal finances really well because youtubers career as a Lil bit volatile I don't know why my future execute myselfInside Out so could you give me like one subject which of thinking of you know this is what I need to login on over the next 10 15 years I think probably consumption patterns in this new media landscape that we have today the films are working at the box office are so different from the one side work 5 years of 7 years ago people's attitudes of changed because of the anytime anywhere Khush content that they have access to the consumer the the shorter versionthe short of formats that today a working much more than the longer formats the fact that people are maybe in the future it'll look at cinema as a very rare fight special experience in the going to the theatre rather than it being something that when we grow up it was the only game in town just being able to be up to speed with that and then hopefully being a few steps ahead of it because as a creator of content whether it be on any platform you need to be able to have some insight into what people might want to watch 3 month6 month or your down the line and just trying to be ahead of the curve there it's tough because you've got to today 20 AVI about technology you've got to understand the way that people are interacting with content much more than you did in the past is changing people's perceptions of content like people seeing Tik Tok something a lot of the public is enjoying very different things and they were enjoying se 20 years this fascinating the fact that 18 seconds right 18 to 20can be can actually tell the story however one thread the story my Di but you can tell stories and the fact that there were people are open to that and the attention spans dwindled so you've got to be able to catch people's attention with shorter formats of content and therefore your choosing to still too long form it better be great it better be something so compelling that people are willing to put away the cell phones which they become a life line and just stared screenOppo to us is the world Bollywood looking at the world of social media in WhatsApp them and other guys like you already have a lot of the front screen talent which uses social media very well known and asking them to ask about the producers and directors producers directors actors are they looking at youtubers ticktokers and saying that they can enter industry on the retro some clarity absolute team event that produces a looking at the because I mean earlier a celebrity had to be known around the country for MBBSbut today a producer could well be someone being mobbed have no idea who they are there be more of them all and you like your you feel really out of touch because you like that is a social media sensation you don't know who they are and they clearly have great amount of appeal to a section of the audience so I think it's important for the more structured Industries to look at the world of social media number one learn from it number to be able to get some of the Talent into what they are doing is there for you in securityunlike serial actress is an accredited business is an insecure this I think that's a given so insecurity is an inherent part of what we do because what we do so non-binary write it is there is so so much subjectivity there is so much of smoke and Mirrors the so much of relative wanted that you can't help but be insecure I think about managing your own insecurity in a way that is productive rather than you know destructive but when it comes to this world and show the sensorwhy do we need to look at it as an opportunity rather than being insecure water is used to open the door so much new talent around the country which had the platform to expose itself earlier so why should be insecure about it that use it it's kind of dialler TalkBack LLB get out of like the professional conversations again coming to you your 45 and reliability locate a lot of other producers will look at you as a blueprint some people consider you competition do you allfeel that kind of insecurity debate of OK what happening there like do you have a sense of competition at all the sense of competition is more about why I wish that scripted come to me or I wish I'd made that film it's much more a wanting to have been associated with great work and therefore there feeling better between job out why didn't I think of that covid-19 think of the divided we come up with that before they did that sort of competition and think that's that that's very healthy your is it good tobecause you don't turn off the living in a round bubble and reaching to your own choir and being quite you know securing yourself and be reduced to about what's going on around you and that's why you're seeing people go down because it does happen because very often you consider yourself so completely for what's going on thinking that you have all the answers you become a little bit yourself redundant in your thinking and therefore then when you are trying to do something for the audience of the day it becomes irrelevant as a personAdam and what are your challenges I think breaking myself out of my of the medium in which I've been born and brought up to be able to embrace the technological changes are happening today and be able to reach we are able to engage with much more I am I am I am not on social media I am definitely engage with it in terms of I know what's going on it but I am not an active participant and I don't plan to be but without I have to find a happy medium between the twobetween not being a participant but still not being an exposed to the way that the younger generation is thinking the experience is a they having the world in which they living because otherwise one would be able to create your own work that resonate with them have to solutions to the you got the Kareena Kapoor route and yellow ki social media use of the compound Monk entertainment and wheel will help you order the latter the great idea OK full kind of you knoweverything that is today from your professional world one ask you about relationships and get more of a brotherly conversation so so black you seem to have been like those who has lower your twenties 3:30 am sorry Stella but did you have time for something like relationship then because you also I know that romantic movies IO go to so you are a romantic somewhere in your heart and soul Knight and you in this whole game of YouTube running to youcompany and you will never losing out on that there is a part of me that has to sacrifice their sacrifice is a part of what was your romantic life like in your 20s and 30s life will remain without getting into any details it was won by I guess you live alone right there are times when you give more importance to your professional life than your personal life and therefore your personal life suffers there are times when I mean by the birthgiving as much important that it suffers anyway so it really depends from person to person I see if you can find a balance that would be great but the less time to go out looking for something the most likely to happen organically always best when it happens organic I am a little bit convinced about that here rather than seeking out very actively because that's likely to be a little more short term then can happen organically only on 18 $1 27 had your heart brokenin college in school actually really I am in your we all go through that in school you will like someone like you back your heart breaks and you think it's the worst thing on earth you think it's Sky will fall down on you and life is over but I think it's great that every point in life that we go through our experiences as real to us as they would be today in fact even more so because we haven't seen enough of life to know that life will go on so the doors heart breaks are probably even I mean much more intense thanyou later so sorry your business man who got a romantic side and wherever there is this kind of Cocktail I also feel that your partner Vidya Balan is an emotional anchor for you especially for your work so I could you elaborate a little bit on the I think it's great that we have Each Other because we know the business and we know the world that we come from I can't imagine what it might have been to be with someone who didn't understand the daily ups and downs ofthrough and therefore the shorthand between us with things you need to be said we understand and we know the sort of day someone had that you get you you you get it you don't need to try to empathize with that you actually do anything that's that's great I have been very lucky I I think in that respect to be able to be with someone who is from the same industry and is going to the same things at the same time so in that sense right but I think for sure if you wanna talk about it feel free to just shut up Ranveerbeing a romantic at heart Could you give us a quick you know story of light what happened like what you love story do so with the and I actually met on the you know meet on the sidelines on one killed Jessica you know you doing fun together and you know one thing led to another I am I am going private that we should not reveal more than more than that but nobody it was it was it it happened like I said you organically and very you away naturally we got to know each otherjust you know one thing led to another so it was it was great I think you know it's something that we probably would need that time and so far so good ok like what specifically at a Gai again what told you that ok this is the one is hard to say whether there was a one moment when one got to know it happened gradually over a period of time but like I said I I think there was so much commonality in our own upbringing probably andhaving come into the industry from the outside and having had to walk away into it that we could understand each other quite quite well and we knew that we were privileged to be in the position that we were in because not there are many people was Paya to have come into this business and we had the chance to actually Be A and B as you know deeply involved is we are and we both really value that and it was gone and the the higher than the work ethic a similar amount of you know it will be both have to work and therefore the understandingworldwide Yadav you know maybe is so involved in so intensely a driven into something at a certain point of time to the exclusion of everything else can also be understood considering the fact that you have Sagar Complex had with him coming to again I'm sure you thought of this what is like the makeup of a good relationship like what create a good relationship with what I've been reading a lot lately and the mistake I made in the recent past is at a lot ofyoung people go from 0 to 100 like very fast and relationships is it true that you take it gradually once every time I am sure that an aspect of it what are the other aspect of a few problems on a long-term basis friendship it's been great friends because you should be able to really get along with the person does a cone have to spend a lot of time together for many many years to come and I think if you don't enjoy each other's company and continue to 10 laugh in the silly and be in a n and the also dependshopee and all those with each other and be able to keep sharing as as time goes by some people shall have some people share more but just accept that about each other may be hoping to try to draw the other person if they don't share that much into sharing more than that makes for a great relationship so if you ask for one thing I'd say it's a deep friendship is a what time is it true that love fades and partnerships last I'd actually say no white se love bills becauseI think what what we stock the intensity of when you first get together right because then it's all about getting to know each other it's a It's and virus and its its unit of you don't know each other that well so solver discovering Each Other over time I think there's a deep love that that builds and I think like I've seen it with my parents they had a brief volatile marriage but they had a love marriage in the met with my dad was 22 my mum is 18 and they've been together for more than 50 years and Ithe eldest son I've seen the ups and downs in their relationship to see that was kept them together is friendship and that friendship has led to the love building more and more over the years we know each other Inside Out the know each other's strengths and weaknesses completely and it is great friends we cancel laugh you know together you require work or is it feel like work I think it's touch feeling like work then something wrong somewhere and you can show work on it thenI think it it requires it requires attention like don't don't take it for granted and hearing sound like a Love Guru or something when I have to provide more you know more error then then then success in this department but but I'd say it's probably about just not taken for granted and variety of it from time to time but you realise that and then you realise what you will be withit is when you stop and you know you want a girl for a person so what the day in your life like write up as write the top Hindi film producer what happening its exciting is having some days are busier than others but it could be a from team meeting brainstorming on all the projects we have in development on to a script narration onto problem meeting with some partners have a working on something with selected business Associatesprobably an actor meeting may be a director meeting sitting with writers and brainstorming on the script it's really quite varied in that sense and you know when there's a film release of the sea that much more intense when you're working on production its maybe a little bit less so it depends from time to time more stressed around film releases for sure everyone everyone on tenterhooks you want to know the audience is not think you're hoping to give enough in the right platformbut I think over time one is known to to know that how is going to be experienced meditation I haven't ok I haven't I have to admit I haven't my mother's deeply into into into it but no I haven't actually I know you have it can a force to like dive into the weather UIDAI windroid dues to go back to your parents with questions or with doubts about the real thing like thatI share a lot with them but I probably don't go into doubts about career 17 because that's something that you know when you have a spouse you got brothers to share that with whom we understand the world little bit more I don't feel it's fair my to burn my parents with those issues they love to be burdened with them because they enjoy that is shared with them I'd try not to if I can help it because I think that this stage is important for them to enjoy life and just you know have this time tohow does life like change you for 30 years of life your hat I mean Phosphorus you know we we don't have kids at this point so we be really focus on our work right now we try to pyaro spend spend time together we can go of brakes and your holidays spend time with friends time with family and I think it what it would be I can't think of different it would be my for 30 persons my 30s I honestly don't see the point of difference is26 probably still trying to find what it is actually wanted to do and does the lack of work life balance there was there was it in my 30s was probably a little bit in my only 30 sbl with the lack of a triangle are still learning and still trying I will still you know a bit in a new World trying to figure it out there for you know what you myself to the bone it's a trying to understand what it was all about because every day was a new experience you have all kinds of charactersyou and you could of sink or swim wear it was exciting but it was also all all consuming how are you maintain that work life balance now at this stage it become easier to do so because I think when one is a entrepreneur one can plan things in a way way you blocked that time out then you require it doesn't always work out but your time is for be your own more to that extent but it doesn't mean it is accountancy so it is going on yourthe other way to look at it is do you need to separate work and universal life completely or is there a way to seamlessly integrate them in a way that you have a work day if you got something personal going on through the day you got into it and come back and then if you got something work-related when you got your personal time you work you work around it if you try to segregate the two distinctly you'll always fall short of the standards your train set for yourself because I think in today's environmentdistrict to imagine that you can shed yourself after 6 p.m. and switch on Again at 10:00 a.m. special in this city and and in the business that within a mean we are dealing with creative people were dealing with people who don't necessarily operate on the you know Sun sunrise and sunset situation you are dealing with deadlines for dealing with think that it is just about working around rather than trying to set yourself to an impossible standard because of abecause of a perpetual Dono part of that is kind of analysing yourself also is my question is what do you hate about yourself is there is always that one and it's a strong would you like to know you're not comfortable with you in my wait I grow up really I grow up a really fat kid I was 90 kg is in the seventh standard so I I literally was you know I was everyone call me moto and its measurement of the payment fluctuate so I am on a constantok anyone who knows me knows about me with a perpetual diet and trying I am I am a sucker for the new diet fat of the year of the week of the month of the year and I have the ability to lose and put on both very easily and therefore the amount that I am able to fluctuate is quite intense but I do think it would be great for me to be able to be like a lot of people around us study wait for decades on end that would be something and Aspire to also a Punjabiconnected to an ap is dieting food is a food is zero I live to eat Ragini 2 live so I know that about your for meetings with you and I have seen that you enjoy it would just as much as I do so and that's what also can you give me a little comfort to talk to ki apne bhai se so one question I am one thing that help me personally on the whole weight and loving food battle is intermittent fastinglike just having a body for 16 hours it's difficult for the first week but it's so beautiful and unique and an addiction you can't live after point so if you're not try that one thing I would like highly recommend I have tried it I have to have yet but I will get back to doing it in an intensive where's your saying it is just about starting a body that now and it was a very beneficial for your career the second thing that really help me is choosing an activity that I am genuinely enjoy its original dekhna football give me a lot of room tolike any work of a lot of calories your soul noting the photo you take up the activity you enjoy I also enjoy Vetri vizha fashion blogger to make you look better and clothes near to activities but long term care is just using activity absolutely and so my final question 2 of this podcast ok to questions first we will be selfish question at a new kind of know the work I do you know what happening in the office what your personal advice to melight and continue doing what you're doing because you're doing a great job I think you got such a great team had the chance to meet them in the last you know are also reducing really really pump with what they doing this seem very energize very motivated which is great and that's a reflection of your leadership and just and it will have this conversation before as well a focus on the things that you actually want to get done may be in the next two years three years five years because the the termdo many things is is quite a bit today is special for your generation will look at the amount of opportunities out there but I think you pick your battles and then keep changing the spirit is from time to time but have a set of very focused fix priority is not more than 3 probably very big thing that you want to achieve that that might be the best way to go to the last time we had this conversation at your office I've incorporated that in my life and I gave up on a few battles that I was fighting and actually benefit me a lotthe second question is just for the listeners the view was watching MS 3 pieces of life advisor just encapsulate everything the real relationships all that whatever but you are the three biggest learnings of life I've never really thought about it that way so I might struggle to put them into three but I'll just say the few things that I try to do don't always succeed but try one is I like I said only I think the harder you work the luckier you get so it's very easyki prescribing your situation your circumstances on external factors and to say why is this happening to me how lucky the look what happened for them it is very easy because it takes the weight of you it gives you a free pass to be able to figure that life is not fair but I think it's not fair and fair life could care less One Way Or The Other you really got to make your own you know destiny and I think sometimes have setbacks you will you will have setFacebook two ways about it would just keep at it right just keep at it and things will break through if you try 100 things one thing will happen at one thing will propel you into a range of opportunities that you can't imagine deliver the second thing is really follow up what you enjoy make a carrier or a what you enjoy you because you will be spending most of your waking hours doing that it might as well be something that you really are passionate about and then worked on feel like work it just won'tthe third one is don't don't don't take yourself too seriously as your going on the spot just give yourself time be kind to yourself give yourself the time to be able to let your hair down enjoy life spent time with people that you care about don't let relationships go go by that you know you valued but just because of the passage of time you didn't give enough attention to when they suffered a could be friends could be family could be someone that you love those three pieces of advice I think I try to followKaise I don't want to succeed at it I try I know I told you that this is the last question I have one more thing your early because of your love for cinema your love for content is there like a story that you've read in your childhood or come across someone in your life will be mythological maybe historical something I just sat with you and your life ok that my dream project that's what I want me to sleep son animated version of the Mahabharata at someone do that because it's always in my mind like some kid had a huge impactMI growing up so what's that story for me to Mahabharat Mahabharat I can't sit animated version but it's just doing the Mahabharata as it should be because that made a massive impact on a growing up I feel every possible human emotion relationship situation philosophy is captured in the Mahabharata in some shape or form and it just such a difficult task to put that on 2 theatrical or a series format in a way that someone can get the head aroundbecause it just such a monumental effort but that would be I think the Pinnacle of what someone could achieve if one has to tell Indian stories to the world and I think it will happen if multiple at least twice or thrice in my own lifetime in a big way to show everyone was told that had an impact on a lot of world leaders of people who has lived in life so glad to know that this idea was well anyways it thank you thank you can't tell you an observation or no but it was veryPython impact on Lord of world leaders of people who has single life so glad to know that this idea was well anyways so thank you thank you can't tell you an observation or no but it was very stimulating for me to pick your brains like this had a great time thanks a lot I am glad you're on the chosen for the next time guys on the Ranveer show from Siddharth Roy Kapur and the biceps

Jaiswal one of India's top startup Minds irrespective of the chosen for yourself every single human being should know how to run a Startup how to launch a business in the country what kind of business

paper addresses the offer to their grades is this incredible revamping the education system in the country today and in doing so he is created a multi-million dollar business that why you should be listened to this guy is also being mentored by our top startup Minds of the country this is a slightly long episode trust me listen to it I know there's a lot but at the end of the 55 minutes you'll agree with me this one was episode which will come backat some point in your future life if the India's most intelligent podcast with India's most intelligent friendAyush today's podcast topic is how to start a Startup problem Indian perspective so everything from how you actually get the first business idea to selecting a co-founders to raising money the stage for add you recently Race 2 million dollars for pesto your company for those who don't know about festival give a brief introduction you just quickly explain what pesto 10 superstars who is a three-month program for senior Engineer Civil Tech engineers who are really talented in Indiadon't have the right opportunities so we take them we give them the necessary training to bring the Mac power with Global engineers right to make them a great professionals andbrightest Minds and work on complex problems today to learn more and can sit in India and work from the from their home or they can book from you know any coworking space or anything which makes them feel comfortable in the last interview after 3 months afterpalot also depending on how would like the student is kind of revamping the education system in a way that I've always said now bro before you did other jobs in the whole starter world Your mental by people like doctor Ritesh Malik top startup Minds in the country kids watching this man what is the first step if you know yourself ER I can't have a boss and I want to leave the start of life what is the first step inwould you suggest going on the same for you and all that working in a start of an understanding the I think like every part everyone write their own path and everyone that is unique write the flag I don't really know anyone was followed you know anyone that there is no Skyline everyone has their own story but I think one of the most important thing is to realise that everything is start is is at least likely 5 years journey it's like you're not looking backwardsmy story but but stories of any other people who has seen it only takes 3-5 years to connect with 4 into 10 into what we're trying to do so I think that is one of the second thing is I just having the attitude that I don't want to boss it or you don't want believe me when when you are actually leading a team you have so many bosses instead of one what do you are accountable to every single person because anything we should do wrong wrongnew but everyone is there so its baby big responsibility I think you should not Fabian entrepreneur speaker if you want to work for a selfie don't want any Boss because that's likely go and that is something is definitely doesn't doesn't fly in in in in in the skills you need to be humble you need to you know understand why you're trying to go in not take decisions driven by your ego so I think you knowaspect of responsibility is something only understand 12 actually become an entrepreneur cbp committee office and you realise that the work you are doing is actually feeding Mouse problem feeling in the family is now the role that I feel it coming back to starters for all of us should know entrepreneurship is not easy that's one kind of glamorized think we see on Silicon Valley and division TVF between The Alchemist life and very difficultare usually a board lost a lot of relationships in this for your journey be given up a lot of things leave you don't have a social life that same people from my Industries your whole life kind of just turns into your career that I think a lot of people tell me right I think it's the one where is that you definitely make compromises livevery few friends and I like your few people who were pretty close to me or no people spend time with tickets majority of my time just going to work and I like that's like given like if it had been on you just like after be there in India outline of like you have to be around all the time you have to be added it really difficult for me to to turn off Rider the second thing is that I see a lot of people who come tonews don't have a life I think that's also know the right way to look at it I think I don't feel bad about that because it is a choice which I make because I enjoy doing this so it's not that it's too bad in that sense it carefully hardwood but then it's not that you don't have a life you life is like a part of your work your work life integration is closer than it is for normal people if you ask us thousand times ki would you ratheroffice outing with always building thatmoney in order to become powerful and in order to have the resources actually changed the world that my driving force what your internal strongest driving force Steve Jobs is a huge inspiration but on a personal level are you doing it somewhere for a big Mansion that you want one day for the family cast are you doing it become investor invest in startups for the and you know it was it forward like what what you are Vibes in interesting you brought this up because I think a lot of people think that it's given by your ambitions to Canadaachieve material used in goals but the way you friend it was very beautiful I don't think it's materialistic in any way because if it was materialistic I would have given a long time ago because there are days when you can see that you can achieve that in different ways than going for what water and the doing rightvideo based oven money in the world rather than going to show time of year special when you don't see the light in the Tunnel distance then definitely you know that any light can apply kelsey so you can always figure out some other ways to make money but I think my time force has been to truly create an impact in that you want to create a positive impact on the world I feel very satisfied when a person graduating a place to get job so rewarding that not only hisnews live completely changed his right and that's very satisfied with this fine feeling and at the same time it's also a lot of responsibility right I feel I feel very nervous and I work day in and day out that all these people were coming and we make sure that the future exactly their futures and dependent on your right and then would you like I think your biggest ration entrepreneurship ki yaar Mere Marne Ki vajah Se Kisi Aur ki life and benefits for surethe goal of majority of entrepreneurs and think I know good entrepreneurs who just want to create a better a larger impact in people's lives in a think there is no better feeling in the world if you can be the business which which is creating a long lasting impact in anyone's life Sprite in one person's life I think that's that's incredibleyours context about what entrepreneurship is like on the inside what the worst most winning moment of a life that come out of his entrepreneurial journey recording both monetary economics money offer you get success from made you feel rewarded with giving back to peopleI think I used to go hungry right like at one point like the save money initially used in using Bootstrapthat's something which I am really concerned about now and it's not only you know a financing because I can a for my phone now that you're basically build a habit of things which is very hard to improve write this no time for you to do any kind of physical activity and things like that or you just don't are unable to focus on your health that much I think that might be my bad habit like I A constantly struggle with sleeper sleevelessDeepika Telugu means sketch more sleep sweating like I need to focus on that so that's like my back point I think for me Physical health is not the concern because I think for the nature of my government YouTube I need to look great I have to put To Shame I have to get sleep enough to eat well so I kindly look at eating sleeping gyming as a part of my job profile but in saying that I do feel my personal life has been like my affected because entrepreneurship again I know that now what I am exammy branded me bas brand my face my body after take care of these things now I am running a business meetings and running YouTube and take care of my body and face and in that process I definitely my relationships of infected and lost like a long-term health rides like it is affecting Your mental health for surprise at at at its affecting mental it indefinite leave you know I can tell you what again Yoga meditation is all that kind ofbackup for your mental health it has to take a mental but you definitely take a lot of pulses for example I love to date that person in the long term but she is ambitious ambitious we can't make time for each other in a long-term relationships and it's like if you ask me a thousand times ki are would you choose a relationship would you choose this organisation by a pink 35 family is income 35 families food is my responsibility to that one personwhy people are the 2 million people of following your biceps and waiting for the value adding content so I have 2 million 35 people on one side and an address one person to another site as much as I love that one person responsibilities responsibility so difficult moments like this which kind of life of a unit process of entrepreneurship is it said it was rightintense world man but ok let's quit the motor glass talk about practicality and I think different statusto figure out like you need to be like a different person in different stages so when there is someone starting out early in the entrepreneurial journey I think learning is is one of the biggest things I think I think it is right was that a very early stages that I went out to completely disable am going to work for you free right for for short time for you know if you want even for a long time and I used to work for them like 18 hours a day right and I just take it for free but in returnDon so much that was I say my college education right and I think that is something which which people should focus on educating yourself with tons and tons of content and write reading books and work experience that something which which is the biggest thing when it comes to entrepreneurship because you learn by practical experiences and Quest books writer and Packers and podcaststhis podcast is a kind of disc and the last four years of my life hacks that are used in order to learn more and it has been bought a loan business think my my content consumption more than reading watching has been audio reply I am like very big inaudible now is to read books a lot area I think that is increased my book reading speed and at the same time there are some amazing podcast by wonderful peoplethis one my Reid Hoffman which which is the one of my favourite ones and then with open my father of Indian heroines like a wonderful podcast masters of scale and there's another one by a 60 mg which is refund in in us know that what causes as well and if you want to search for other thing for someone who is trying to enter the answerJohnny justice reading books and a trying to get exposure working at a small startup trying to understand how things work and what are the things which can be done in a feeling that is like one of the most important things at an early stage figuring your way out in a very and conventional way is what you need so everyone knows that you are supposed to Hasil but when it actually come to asking a lot of people back out thinking that yaar Meri Ya Muhammadwhat is the record that people always kind of attached a lot of value to immediate reward with our understanding that one I personally strongly believe that the universe registers all your hard work even like when you clean your room floor with a broom even when you've tried and recorded videos and S6 camera and verify the first YouTube channel video call that gets like recorded somewhere in the universe to any kind of hard work in the longwill teach you a lot of lessons whether it is industry Bass lessons or whether its life lessons get making a strong women don't shy away for hard work never leave you think that yaar if I'm doing this would be no kind of value added in my life is the mean of resultant victory for me it ok do the man you should work smart not work hard that people who have worked hard and you always giving priority to working hard and not smartmodest but really Ayush is like one of the biggest has done a lot of free work for people I know you are the bro and that are good for this class is well a lot of people have taken advantage of you sometime in the past you and you agree that like them in this guide is so let's usecalling favours from the same people later on May 20 you will come your close friends associate business associate is a beautiful quote you to akot nahin matlab to Abhithe world is Serendipity Serendipity is that I think of this world as as you know a positive response to building to and just assume that you just keep giving back and in some form or the other just assume that is going to come back at some point or the other right so I just believe that you know as normal human beings you should not screw anyone no matter who they are at what stage they are yougenuinely not not do anything back to any one or two in one this is because I mean agree like you think that this is the right thing to do when I think this is if you look at the ecosystem is especially the startup ecosystem in am I don't mean this only from a business perspective that you're not do well Sarai good things incomplete that's very selfish of the holes and saying do well by everyone because that the right thing to dorule of life yoga yoga this concept of one doing good to the world you know just being a good human being all that and to giving your work your honest 100% together the two things together are called karmyog which is light is a form of yoga as a new get spiritual advancement by doing it to the binding of clean human being not hurting the people at the same time being 100% do these two things and operatorpresent themselves to you agree and and bro done your you doctor Colgate 18 and 24 No 6 years and I've had for your career and both of us would strongly agree with this side yaar we know that all we were not hurt you meaning and even have worked on is 1% and hero lot of people when this happens to us well they come to me and say your damn good you done so much and I will be like bro it's been really lucky and there is a a new hobby lucky don't discount your heartwhen I say that yaar you need to come in the my shoes need to be my shoes and understand how many opportunities presented themselves to me and people don't buy that are likely put method Theory on this I feel that the majority of people have been curious and is like young private school people and ask them what was the most important thing which you think is beyond the scope of this thing that I got lucky and Confused how can a very good policeI think this thing that you need to work hard to put yourself in positions where we can get like it like that two people in the room setting throwing darts at at award bridal target now if you through to the US was known as throwing darts and you say that the person trying tenders got lucky in a dark room hit the target through to write its basically putting yourself in how many positions that we can get the opportunityon is hard work exactly not started working a lot of members in the team who left within a couple of months there is only oneEdward anyone who can't whether that is the founder of a set of whether that is lowest level employee because you need to be taken from your own parents from society from your friend from the people of working with from the companies that are working with an insult to everyone has doubts from everywhere there is obviously very difficult situations where you think that are made kahan Phas Gaya but the people who can survive that are true startuppeople that everybody is a new Path Read access path which has been exploited so I think it's I think one of the things which people like this which which they should believe in which I kind of feel that we helped me a lot was that you have to remember that you are in it to run the marathon not a sprint and your in it to win it towards the end of the game you are going to win it and you're running a marathon so people who think that you are running a Sprinklewhat you know that it's going to come late but will come at some point this is where will I get my idea of the Startup ideas not give applied but what I am asking Ayush Jaiswal is bro your very educated in the start of would give me Pal very good industries which is a starting point for them so if there is 10 college watching this give them like 45 optionabout industries which they should look into to begin the release date of journey in physics think Shudra role of analyst at that when you're starting out only you should always think that you are running a marathon running a marathon you should build for future ready suitable for what what are things going to be like in next three to five years right not what's today because by the time you build it will be irrelevant wide and in the world is moving too fast always look for the future I think for someonefinding out early sudden changes happening around the world one of that is remote work right the the office culture the the coming together trend of people coming together to enough space to work in a company is slowing and getting away and the idea of distributed teams is coming and because some people like working from the beach is right so because of that a lot of fundamental changes are going ona16z size is going to in the world and that is kind of like always win win lottery is software do so with so Billing software which can can help you integrate as a remote person into a team we communicate better it so artificial intelligence is the technology which is changing different industries write another another industry worth exploring is basically like replacingGautam machine I can do the same human resource as basic as a software as a service is basically a website or an app which helps to communicate with your help we do any kind of task better which have to pay for Europe on and on the other hand is another technology which is completely revolutionizing many Other industries right so it's like a buthuman beings taking of human jobs that the lemons understanding of it but won in 2019 where does it stand and to when will be actually start signal irobot style world Europe where there are machine doing all of household tasks IIsecond industry would be may be yeah I think you not to have robot but not humanoid robots but I think as a software which can take decisions based on datafrom iron man but that is making things be more efficient and it's kind of like reading that sort of impact in different industries liquid cooling example of that is is you know for example Facebook algorithm for Tiktok why is like one of the best examples rightsocial companies in Chennai for using Tik Tok for a while se using it for a days water can dispenser with this person that this kind of content and under the bell push push you more of life don't like that and then we have in the mainstream that stands right now that it's software it's like things that basically improve the experiences of apps or services that you and there is self driving Cars or thing now in all those things are there now what'swhat's what's interesting is that Elon Musk company call neuralink just launched a new thing with the said that they're going to integrate machines with human brain starting next year so that they'll be interesting take on humans humans are going to implant something in your brain using which will be able to control thingsdevices that exactly where is supposed to get launched next year 2020 feature is very fast paced so it's another another thing which which I feel prettyabout is Air India I think that is something which is augmented reality and virtual reality and virtual reality it's like if you see in like people with huge headset that's virtual reality I think there is more exciting at this point it is basically you are taking your se Snapchat camera using camera and you be easily put it on the stable and you'll be able to see a bunny rabbit on the table or whateveryeah that's the social media aspect of what you can do from Israel which code required by another one in SF so what they do is that they basically help you buy furniture in all of your camera look at your entire room and select the furniture from the app which looks good in your room and then by all of it at once that's like another cool application of you know howbuy furniture for example includes or basically anything that I think you purchase and used in another friend of mine Megha is working on the mirror which is basically you can stand in front of a mirror and you can try any kinds of jewellery talking about influencer marketingjust think it's pretty much what you see youtubers do you know any 2 brand used on a YouTube has maximum money that there is digital marketing because every single business in the world is like kind of moving to determine everybody needs a marketing strategy and other use Industry that you can get into both as a provider of the service and actually kind of utilising this service for yourself is this whole concept of personal branding which is basically they know your usual urine pestoJaiswal brand which is the Dolphin who is running a company called a store and you just put off your real life on Instagram if you really want you to be part of the stories of pesto and they listen I am enter them that become the usual personal branding and going forward crucial requirement for many motivational speakers for this could be a lot more applications of this industrythe counter space in general in India is is very exciting content video audio I think both I think they always My Autograph I think what happened in India since last three years with you coming in putting soon people on the Internet injury right and others have given rise to the speaker Cotton Industry which I believe is excel in only for India but but for the worldlike U no work and I think the barrier to increase solo in the editor that's like something which you can explore early on in their careers and if nothing then just learn a bunch of things in the cones and skills that I will be able to get absorbed by Pharma marketing companies are Mandal coming because I take care of it was basically a brief amount ofsince for you guys to choose from and also says that find own path I possibly say that won't work for me was actually working in a business an old-school business which is now called engineering factory and that only one crucial lesson that any business in the world is doable it boils on the common sense to take a decisionable to create a business model of that didn't exist at one point in reality but you had that you have the balls basically to think that I will be able to do this and executing on doing things and then one day forget be together 2 million funding or lack a fantastic TV show that I'd recommend a show called Silicon Valley show it's the American version of petals in want to show that incredibly funny and fails to deliver a lot of shit you all at the same time it's extremelyhow the whole startup old was again but that we Americans are tabulated come back to the Indians are used to start a business in India once you have your Idea ok se suppose that a company you understand ki ok maybe then what is your next step you how do you actually start a business can tell talk more about finding the idea or I think that time is gone it was the internetin early 2007 you were in the.com bubble where you have to do this to create like no 2 booking for hotels recreate like you know text.com which which Delta tried so I think that time of their Idea was the thing is long gone so we need to stop thinking from Idea perspective it's more about how to create more value for the customer problems on problem solving perspective God now when it comes to problem solving perspective people startproblems right that if you can find the problem then I am going to solve then customers will pay for it I think that's also wrong approach which which is my experience which I had a I can think about it this way that I can remember this quote from Ford write the founder of for the car company I said that if I ask the customers what they want then then people have asked for a faster horsehorse carriages exactly if you look for the problems you going to look at it from every one's perspective but startups are usually built in a way where you can make things more efficient can you find better ways of doing things and one day you find so much better way of doing something that the previous way of doing it looks like a problem for example Paytm happened right foot recharging your phone was that there is any panwala would do that right outside your house would alsoso it was easy it was that it right but then after period came in IT certainly looks like a problem like you should look to make things much more efficient and there is a delta for theory by Kunal Shah which is which is pretty amazing said that if you look at the previous way of doing things give it a reading from 0 to 10 the look at the new way of doing things give the reading from the rule 10 if the Delta between both these two are doing thingsfor a new found something which is of value between make money which will eventually make money so you need to figure out something which which place value and face value your customers will pay for the value has to be there again because something that should look forDeepika about I mean not not for a problem but for a cause which busy stand for and then you're trying to figure out a way to do something for them for example like I deeply care about education and because I went through that I had that background I suffered through that you know semester when I really want to drop out and it didn't feel feel good in college nobody was allowing me to I want to learn engineering but I couldn't and all of that rightI was really deeply motional e waste into and I can I have the emotional connect with all the engineering and ammeter a developer and I feel like bro your brother to me that eventually I didn't exactly and it made me hold onto this in the toughest times when it was the very easy to give upso finding that emotional call waiting in the world biggest business is generally however the cord purpose driven that your purpose was to like affect the education system either way this parallel version of education employment coming back to how to actually start a business grow in this country what are the Logistic what is the paperwork required for obesity and monkey we actually had an agent to do all of it for a slimy rent we didn't take up any of the official workwhat happened was aware ki hardik required unit is a pan card Aadhar card whatever you need to build up once your business is set up when you understand that what is the meaning of proprietorship what is the meaning of private limited you know think like that what is the meaning of equity equity means of shares of this tomorrow if we are 50 50 50 + equity and 50%baby on me to get to the start of the othercontact that I think it's it's very simple if you just do your research on Google will let you know about it if you really want to understand a to z of soccer ball the legal terms there's a book which are highly recommend every entrepreneur to read it called when should be used by Brad feld amazing book talks about entire universe and everything you need to know as an entrepreneur to be able to talk to lower the searching tax that's the biggest one but I think when you studying out only itsyour job really like your job is to find value you job is to create on the business exactly and and wasting a lot of times in into getting into complexities of these things which you more I think the simplest way is to the established a proprietary form for partnership firm which takes like in a less than couple of days it's it's free quick and you can basically start the business Kare bank account in Instagram clients I think that the quickest way to start it once youyou have found something which you really want to do and you want to make this is like a proper company and maybe once in a little things like that then you should go ahead and establish your private limited fund private limited company not initially do your basics set up the business make some money like that so manyI will they can you lose a lot of money you spend it where it should be spent not careful about the cash flows so even if you want to raise money going forward from investors you need to show them that they are you know I am capable of making money first as well so what are your life music from infected you invest your money as capital I mean so so you are all the time bankrupt initially struggle period was rightbasically invest everything which time which you make so it's like that's the bootstrapping processor you go forward with that when you have some money you of course in West whatever you have you and me when you look for in message I think like they do the research by by a company called idealabs which which is an accelerator besan us it said that 5 top reasons why companies fail and finding moneythe least important one of those companies that finding write a reason being that investors are in the business of making money as long as your business can make money there will be investors right thing is that venture capital works in a different way like you have to have the potential to make lots of money in long term will get to vc venture capital or later ok but right now let's come backUK moneySingapore the Consulting company before a store that was like my first company when I used to conduct a bunch of websites and make some money bootstrap using that I think I did a bunch of other Tata projects with intense workout time I started Pashto I found a coder was who is just an insane code and use micro founded in my partner so he is a really really amazing coder in alsoperson based in a safe now so what we get is that we saw a huge gap between Indian engineers and US engineers and huge paying apps so that when we decided that they are going to do something Consulting firms for us firms that we started like me so I started with your permission of this making money you know it's like we were we were just tired of Tata projects and we decide that you are going to make some money and we want to make money quickit Consulting images of money in over the next three to seven months and once we had made money both of us would like to people want to create value create impact and also add value to people so once we had money with the site do something which which is actually valuable which is creating impact it is what are you doing right now and it was pretty simple right we were hiring engineers in India and placing them in US for 5x their salariesbusinesses based on artificial keeping their salaries Lo that how you make money and we thought that the entire focal point of this entire engagement is the engineer in himself or herself but they are not winning where will be because we are making money the company is the meaning they are getting talent engineers don't want this is weird because that's the focal point so we decided that you are going to come up with a model to make a genius when right so we decided to come up with this conceptpasta very sad that give the going to give you everything which which we needed to do kind of make you compatible with the company in US and then after 3 months of training will place has evolved into a you won't have to pay anything of France with free of cost of front and will take 17% of your salary for an experience like 5x of the making before right so it's like a Win-Win for everyonethe fact that your making money from like the job but they themselves are grateful to people like you and they are lucky to have wonderful people around and we genuinely wanted to help them irrespective of you know what situation where we are and we have come across multiple situations where we didn't have to help you with me thand stepped out of the way of the for way to go on to help people who may be don't even make it to the best programher goal is to help these five million engineer ride em help only 50 till now which is like some 0.00001275 like a long long way to go but we are all in to help of this the final part of this podcast which is the feces the venture capitalist in today's episodehow do they raise money the dangers of at the benefits of it the classic a success stories like Facebook Amazon that have been written out of the whole raising money game so what is this whole world 12 Alpha explain who are visas venture capital setting is really important to understand who they are and and when they come from the understanding their psychology with which they invest in fixed that gives you more perspective into analysing yourself whether or wether you ready for funor not on whether you should one go for venture capital or not because some businesses are just not fit for venture capital and m&a see that they keep pushing for it but this is not fit and it's not a bad thing to be noted for its nature of business right so I think so I will so with people and my ravneshwar who is who is the running metre Exide something which really stuck with me said we are in the business of risktry to understand that BC is come from the standpoint that there their investing in the most risky asset class ever what is this risky asset class this is investing in equity in a developing market which is not yet right India in developing market and your investing in startups in India in India to invest in that now when you look at methe way they invested that if they are investing in a number of companies they didn't know that majority of them chances of them failing is very high right because bill the nature right now the need to look for those one or two companies which are going to win it and it only few companies like let se two or three companies going to win out of 10 then they not only need to win for themselves but also for everyone else who failed write the need to cover up the lawfor the investors and also make money for those in the substrate that means you need to win Big and when you need to win Big on those few investments that means that every business which to invest in as a venture capitalist the potential of that business has to be very high so that's that like a basic understanding the core ideas that investors will always look for businesses with kwhich can be scaled up almost infinitely the infinitely adjustable market has to be big enough for the company to become used to look at the market itself and how is maturing and one of the best markets to be in the market is growing at a rapid pace like it may not be that you jibut which is growing at a methodology for God so one version of that would be India like India the market is growing fast but in terms of industries all indices are you named like problem education education and Healthcare is like the thing that is what I doI think from a business model you need to think what can a business case you are trying to build right if you don't mean anything that's completely fine writers like I can build the company in a profitable way and survive for whatever timeline and and be happy if that would be my personal choice but my mission was to change lives of 5 minute genius you have done only 58 write any want to take the5 million write how do you do that so far that in order to expand your business income of the scale which you are trying to work in terms of impact with the time to create and terms of voltage the time to expand that kind of taking money to fund your cash flows or Europe expanding to those taking steroids in term in in the form of money like thisproduct market fit once you figure out what is it with your going to create was going to add value to the customers that's when you go for raising funds and only after that the storage will work because if you think it when you're not mature enough then then you'll have a bad effectstalk about the Ugly side of starters Indian startup or there is a lot of different dangerous write this whole world so what are some of thedanger that you should look for in a timer raise money for startup I think like it's over Hai be a little bit like people was too much movies I am sure it's not that bad people should be aware of which which issued can apply because ofand one thing I truly believe in that I really really I want to work with people who enjoy working because it it will be a long journey and you don't want to end up being the room in the hardest times the people who says you don't like you basically want to work with people who like working with someone can go along really well with you but notwell with me right it's like that those people and people so I think choosing the people is important but when it comes to terms I think there are also in terms with a couple of things I think grocery items which should be because of you can always read that 90 degrees and will get to know everything about your own or lease terms but I think at the same time you should also respect what otherslooking for you should always think about creating a business from wind prospective investors are there to make money as well and you basically have to make money for them and having an investor on board is actually a big responsibility because they are believing in you right there are a part of your small family with you trying to build and and you have to conflictfreedom like your own family the ones They Come On board and believe me it's like once investors RN 8 investors are not an injustice like you know that give you money and I do think investors also feel that they are part of the same Joni as well Ride It leaves the good investors there they become a part of the journey and there are also very emotionally connected light ever since I took money from Netflix right which is our investorstook Uber rides because I feel that I am a part of the same family now so I think ola Heights which is which is the oldest part of the matrix and I just feel more associated whenever you feel more because they are the same family rights like every company which is there in in in their push for you just feel a part of that ecosystem and I feel that it's more like that everything is healthy in that way and it so soto respect of everyone's interest so you need to make sure that everybody is winning in every scenario and it's like a small world so better live it with everyone not feelings to a happy lifeitem girl in college

58,Indian Education System Changes Explained In Detail ft. Dr.Radhakrishnan Pillai |The Ranveer Show 65,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRl9PruTiio&list=PLfNW_1ECVaThQynVe4QDlBM5S6Kzy8CeJ&index=59,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cRl9PruTiio/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLB2wpUugy1kVQqbtNsX-2FEde7zng,we got an education special of the Ranveer show one of India's top educationalists authors and one of my biggest mentors in life Dr Radhakrishnan Pillai thank you for being on the Ranveer show again to be part of the Ranveer show again and discussing something which is so important to us teachereducationist and for you students parents and the future of our country yes so I think this is a very big game changing moment in the value in education is something that everyone should follow please sit down with the notebook I do believe that somewhere leadership ko of India weather is a government whether that is the core of teaching leadership in the country education leadership they've tried to construct the best possible future in my life I don't never been so happy aboutfrom the world of education so kudos to the whole leadership of the country but so that what was the kind of ko thought process behind Somi changes to go over all the important ones in this podcast but what is the history of this moment like what is lead up to this I am going to tell everything about this in one line this is equal to demonetisation in the education systemso what happened on demonetisation everything of the past just become irrelevant different future so when you ask me what the history about likho second tell you what's more about the future of Indian education system at the global level now coming to this question of what are the history it's been a long pending thing that Indian education system it is very good no doubt about the same education system created the the great leaders at Microsoftthe Google can you it is an I am so does not believe that the surgical system is back what are the safe from time to time we need to reformat and this is our moment in history for our generation crazy crazy so so so of the intention with it at least when you read all the reforms is very much ok Let's create leaders Let's create entrepreneurs Let's create the next generation that will actually make India that Sone Ki Chidiya again with the topic given me a discursive Olive August ki kaise karen Kaisethis is one huge step in that direction to let's dive straight in a selected 10 top point of you are the most relevant for the listeners the first is this 5 + 3 + 3 + 4 system so what does it mean if you look at the current education system ok that itself is going to go to a positive disruption is bad because it kill somebody and create somebody else but when I say positive direction it is much neededok so you look at the current education system we have some nursery kindergarten then have primary and then we have something called as in a secondary Higher Secondary any go to college to generally the education system currently is known as 10 + 2 10th standard you have the exams 12 board exams 10th standard and 12th standard attention because for 10th standard everybody struggling than one year break you enjoy 11th standard to 12th standard and you know what to doit located there is only one so-called final board exam for which you are ready for the world ok so let me tell you believe and mostly picking up from the west and American education system they have one which happens in the 11th standard ok and afterwards you can choose whether to get graduation degree or no so what we are saying is in this particular education system we are going to have basic which is 5 ok the body is 5 primary educationstandard 5th standard 6th 7th 8th as Higher Secondary second I would say then after 6 7 8 9 10 11 you're not having tension exams on Regulation and 12th exam much into 11th standard so that's going to be 3 so 5 is primary education then we have gone or secondary that is 3 to 6 7 8 9and after that you are going to decide your future with the collar that used 11 standard one and then you decide what to do in life when you can go for higher education diploma advanced diploma and graduation so this is a basic understanding of these numbers crazy serve the obvious kind of question and every positive always has a flip side also is that is better rate 9 year olds tenure holder will have to go through a board exam like a while that could bethat could be good character building moment in their lives I think it's in the hands of the parents ideas for parents of young kids like I don't start putting pressure se India at karke dikhao karo karo karo but I also feel that generates a parent to put too much pressure now that over the new generation of this will be a little more easy going that's just my intuition I don't know you tell me about it is not going to be 11 years old child is 11th standard ok so if you look at it it is going to be 11th standard that willholiday 16 years old like the 5 + 3 + 3 show after 5th at 5th standard there will be something to you only from primary to secondary examright now this format has been given how it is going to be implemented it all depends on school to school and their various boards they will all get Birds there won't be and ICSE CBSE SSC nothing know that's exactly what is happening currently we have so many boats so many conclusions and when you go from school to college after 12th standard you don't know what is a marks that is a CBSE then I'll be in that state board the whole idea is to have one standardized testingwhat is the what the name it is looking for but let me tell you it will take some time because nobody knows I am from this board and from that both the ideas to integrated globally because of global things is 11 and forward so it is going to take some time on everything to get much wider variety for data can be that is the vision of this particular education policy for how long do you think it will take like from now till that moment how long did demonetisation takedecision and the second thing is the implementation and the third link social acceptance is already running in this particular country crores of people involved in this might change and I would call it more appealing problems will be some resistance to it and especially you know people already a part of the solar system there are already preparing for the 10 standard board 12th standard is going to be a kind of it Change management issue at the national levelfree people will be directly affected in this number one is the students themselves number to other teachers ok I number 3 are the ones were going to be employers are those people will be helping finding these guys want to be entrepreneurs biting edges have to accept it and you know once the government rule comes most of the teachers have a choice students will have to go through shouldn't generally don't understand education policies only after we come out we realise it was not an education system does actually an examination systemrequest to all the parents know please accept this because parents are the one who are going to be guiding the children to accept this take it positively the outcome will be very good tell me some teething problems at the same problem like any other systems like changing from one house Radha house but I would say that it would take it positively we will be able to manage the change better in a positive way but then when will be actually start seeing this in play and because I didn't understand that concept of mergerthe whole system soap doesn't mean the American system the Europe and Australia and everyone so what I didn't understand that it will tell you today if you look at what you are doing right now YouTube interview the world is your audience right initially every country is to decide its own education policy and the created on education policy doesn't work in till now what is located globally most of the Indians have migrated and we have second generation Indian born that's AmericaIndian I would say different systems and you must have usually had them saying explicit NRI sense in a Hamare Yahan per education system Itna I no problem Nahin Hai a basic education in America 11th standard is taken care by the government itself so there is no financial stress second important part is that you know they have something called as Choice Based education system you will see in our own system student don't the study by syllabus they can actually take maybe one music creditok Taken take 12 Sanskrit grammar Taken take one mathematics waiting 5th standard everybody will be having the common thing with everybody needs to learn maths higher and higher globally everybody enjoy study and studying is a choice I let me tell in American management system IEEE travel to lot of universities abroad you are becoming a graduate is a big thing in India after graduation of you don't get a job that was just saying Your Jindagi Mein Kuchh Bhi kar le beta pahle engineer Banjaraengineering yes I know I also also all almighty and marketing example so you know if you go abroad and engineer is a very highly qualified skilled person and everybody is basic skill 11th standard what we are trying to do that much so that tomorrow when your bored the world level you send little have the basic qualification and also a graduate by chance today graduation is more because of social pressurenew song doctor because of gaadi mein baith gaya na to school education then 12th standard then some degree you should have and we're seeing people unemployable Itni not be employable but let me tell you the Global Sunday graduation means big tits if you look at the passport you know there is something at immigration not required for graduates and every Tom Dick and Harry in India as a minimum graduate it's not something great so we need to respect the graduates who specialise in something that's shradhanjaligraduates of convocation ceremony with the topi and address in India missing ok so what I am doing that this will take us to the global level of course in the education system will be carried by a system explain to you what is you want to change that the global level there is something which system which is to be adopted very soon in Spirit we are kind of stepping up to global levels and also maintaining the Indian spiritwhich brings me to my next point So vocational focus right from the 6th standard so I will be vocational courses what kind of Vocational courses is the government thinking of what happeningeducated the thing is that one of the statistics say that we have a lot of disparity in our country the people were in MBA and going for what they become very in a part of the management team plumber and electrician water truck driver for that matter you know them looked down to respect this called you know and be seen on the labour class 8 short good I remember one of my friends from Austria told you know if tomorrow in Indian who settled in Australia ok tomorrow if my daughteraaj to get married to a truck driver there is no problem with me and educated PhD father was a truck driver also on the same amount of money which may be a CEO of a company can do the social respect dignity of labour I think this education system which start giving you the vocational guidance and training right from the school days for example if you like to be a plumber whats wrong is not doing its job is an excellent job what is what happened thatKrishna part will start getting introduce right from the school so you have worked optional if you want to be a painter the different class for you want to getting this training will be that and locate this way in India was still dependent on people to come and you are repairing of plumbing work electric work but if you look at brought all the basics are done by the same person driver toolkit at home they were carpentry kill and home trainer children to do your to-do list for the small little things it if there is a nut and bolt which is missing required to call a carpenterTrupti rupees the minimum visiting charges given trailer 10 year old look something like a role model is crazy the beautiful will be heading into what what are the locations do you think so will be introduced visit all these your occupation based locations are there other stuff as well every generation have new occupations that never knew about a generation called asduborite and have a great friend of mine cal Ranveer allahbadia I want to make a Swami Vivekananda that said a good economy a good nation is the one who allows people to choose their location and the way of earning money in the olden days you only knew cattle rearing and Agriculture now I think about 20-30 years ago the IT generation Cayman they'll be creative economywhat the feed me you are a part of the creative economy YouTube is creativity but many people thought it is entertainment it is not entertainment it's a profession you or money order of it I or money order of it everybody can I think this is the beauty of every generation they can decide I tell you one instance there was a person who accepted mass media 20 years ago and he told his father that I am going to mass media to father did not an award in the mass media saying that it's all about communication we are so what is your job after20 years ago television channel video he got into a radio chalani got a programmer job his father as I'm what is the meaning of radio program and how much are you getting so he said I am going to get 40000 rupees per month 40000 rupees gana Baja Nikle radio station Mein Aag never heard of it and actually father was shocked when I actually got a social Re 20 is ago 40000 rupees for that father generation Hotel factories were never understood what a radio programming isbaby my generation still wondering what a youtuber is there are so many things one of the things that it's going to have a choice in which you want to make your career your profession I location to you want to be a plumber why not do you want to be a poet why not if you want to be somebody who is good to design Water bottles why not its duty of this education system and the future that you can choose any existing location or you can create a packageyou believe you are the spare header at the start of that for example I started a complete Grand Chanakya never existed to use your career rather than getting frustrated with the education system that you're telling an 11 year old is this is what you need and then you'll be able to do this job and just that realisation that open up their Minds and even more things and eventually in life they all have that confidence of a nose 11 I learnt that myselfsomeone told me some sure I'll be able to do anything with more confidence in Sterling anything else and experimentation you can choose this career for not making him choose only that carrier is like a buffet dinner in everything we want to make it right for a few days a musician try for a few days till you don't taste you don't understand which is the choice you want to make is going to an ice cream parlour Ice cream parlour I will take that it will you knowplay was anything you can take something you don't pay what you like that one flavour which is unique and which appeals to you can buy the whole school education system is called to allow every child to choose what they want and need to don't want to follow it is OK for example after become an engineer everybody Sajan Aaya kya kar raha hai to make money with various different professions you can take a mathematics as a subject you can change their culinary artsyou can take you know maybe YouTube as a subject you can create a cause of it also I think the child actually had the choice to experiment before deciding because if you don't have a choice then you are actually under stress to choose which you don't want to know that it Choice Based education system beautiful also I feel you know I've been reading a lot of us Noah harari he speaks about artificial intelligence how much is advancing which also means that a lotlose their jobs to artificial intelligence therefore what the human beings to everyone laptop skills skills is the new oil of the world the new gold of the world without telling your kind of increasing the respect of the concept of skills in a kids head which is very beautiful one step further to connect to Chanakya also you are gonna find your swadharma what you are good at what is a natural talent and a person who makes a profession out of his motherhis natural God gifted talent and never fail in his life natural teacher Rama natural of the natural speaker connected to Chanakya and the number one in my field everybody can be number one in the field there is no competition there is only collaboration that's the way forward again this can conserve sizes hope people gravitate what I do feel Indus breathing a new generation of human Minds when you let move on to the next ki point which isAb To 11th which is around 13 years old of 14 years old 216 you get to choose your subjects from guessing that 6th standard to eat periods for you too kind of Taste different things and then the finish of buffet dinner and then choose your Ala Carte menu available in EP 211 that thinking absolutely correct and all the teachers have to give the buffet ok remember that also every institution will have to decide because I know for example I have you know whenpart of the selectivity of education policy a little bit I was involved and somebody said in near Bangalore airport villagers ok and can you believe there is not much profession there is no other choice to the one of the pressure of persons accident after this Education Policy was telling us when I got the Bangalore Airport is very far off from the main city all of you must have seen this so travel to Bangalore but if we can create a vacation ok that how can you be a person who can do support system for the Bangalore Airport andcollege teacher foreigners coming speak in Arabic language take them to the hotel to you can have specialised course in Bangalore airport near those education situations it is not a buffet dinner only which is standardized that buffet dinner can be a local choice of my mother would like to give me 10 edition your mother can give it 10 different dishes very beautiful but it will be unique with different spread everywhere that's why we are doing so but practically in schools what's going to happen like as inGovernment schools that ok now you KSRTC people cooking and carpentry and evidence of the government provide the tools like what will happen I will tell you how the education syllabus is formed and let me tell the present several technical process when ever you go to a particular School there is a board ok and there is something called as Board of Studies so who is the board of director material can decide the subject to like for example if the Government State Government this is syllabus in a must have seen a lot of people think that history hashe returned ok the new Indian isotech in Sanskrit your dubbing leadership you doing Chanakya into it so happened to the people come together the intellectual the teachers the researchers and they say you know a lot of things have to change in education syllabus for example lot of things that outdated will you ever teach what you are taught teaching about computers 20 years ago now because a Dot Matrix printer is no more relevant to know we'll talk about the future what is going to happen the Board of Studies the actdown and discuss what are the kind of syllabus and the intelligent people they will actually make a syllabus from two types one is what is called The Spiritual education the moral education at its the character building and the second the technical part of it will become a profession the coming back who is to decide what to teach the first people are the people who are the part of the Board of Studies old decide to you can have a local decision also but it has to be aligned with the national decisionthat we have is a Framework it's like in the government in sab log I will give you free roti and Kapda and I will give you dal chawal but how to prepare the bar chawal is my choice I can prepare Dal in Gujarat with a little bit of a sugar and good more I can prepare the same Dal with sambar in Tamil Nadu Kerala with more Mirchi and rasam powder please understand I am give me your Dal but what do you make out of the lease your choice what is gonna happen is that it will be verycentralised along with Central guidance to that's why you to understand policy and implementation there is a gap at that has to be filled by the teachers and the people were deciding the syllabus so I actually think that this will create a lot more jobs also because it will make eating a more glamorous profession Again which is also something I want to bring you a part of the changes was that a large chunk of the Yearwe will now be dedicated to the education systems of experts and existing ok and it currently is right around 1.5 I need to look at the figures will definitely be getting 3 or 6 person but some major chunk major change that I believe in something like 1.5 right now and is going to 6% with the you would jump but where will that money Goa to go into teacher salaries + infrastructure + like skill development infrastructure things liketo another is a national budget which happens every year is called the union budget which is present in the Parliament and is generally a bi and a part of it goes into health defence education the People's education is a very small thing but let me tell you two things about that education is not just about teaching it also research to set a part of the GDP will also want to research what is the meaning of research let me tell you what happens our education system is actually an examination systemstudy Bima guitar and you know before the exam I am why and after the exam and voice but during the exam otherwise I forget what is very important that this GDP definitely be going to multiple things number on paying the teachers the infrastructure the syllabus because there were a lot of new content coming in the textbook the videos you have a future that if we can create a education videos Ranveer does a huge budget going to come from government also thathan exactly can do together will happen know the other part of it is very important to the lot of things will going to futuristic education currently all the research is going to measure institution like DRDO ISR ok now imagine Student start developing a small you know a pen which is very important for the future instead of you know looking at think one of the things that it's like defence you know we are defined by the different but it is not only to get profilefortunately got it is the difference is also the budget goes into RND mutiba Narsingh 6% that is what the government will give you what what do you do with that money is a personal choice of the institution that state and the teacher also working one of the very important that India has to move from Magan up the knowledge and a baby on Knowledge free on Google Google and become a Devatha to actually doing Research and lot of money will go into futuristic research for all of you can create your own professional an IPIntellectual Property Rights that beautiful so but something that I actually really stuck out to me was the next point also with nice we mention major and minor degree is very American your Arabian concept a people will be studying Engineering and the visiting filmmaking which is a God like scenario for me I wish I had the day in college and also I also I feel like when you give a student interesting stuff to sahi se his chosen and made it doesn't enjoy and it's also seasonmy no I am enjoying a lot it occupies ahead and keep students away from alcohol from drugs from the wrong company when your stimulating your head that much so again could you elaborate on how big is major or minor policy of education policy talks about education 2 Level 1 is the primary and the secondary level but at a higher education that's when you go from 12th standard to degree college and our double 11th standard Degree College very veryimportant step in this is everybody to noted suppose you decided to a BCom a basic course on a ba Ok you need to study for 3 to 4 years for engineers for yourself or adopted for your support to complete for a BCom 2 years and you don't do that here you are still an undergraduate you know what this thing said suppose you decide to do engineering ok you do only one year give the exam and pass you get a certificate ok not to continueyou are you have a value for it for two years but you given exam now you get at Diploma for three years you get an advanced diploma for the whole thing then you get a degree should have to wait for the degree for the fourth year of the third year to get it ok you will get it good or bad because you can decide to leave a student who actually completed BCom but unfortunately did not give to papacy paid fordinner was called a graduate is 45 years old and force them to complete that one become a graduate in every your getting something you decide to go now the good news is that it enjoys it's called in a Choice Based Credit System is a study on out towards one credit on music and 2 credits on mathematics and quick reads on Chanakya leadership by not using the flexibility that we have and the best part is that this credits can be utilised and other universities also that the national education policyKoi to get into credits and completed one year you can go to another college and continue from there are also very flexible system but like how will An engineering college to say my engineering colleges one building want to students life do you go to that engineering college then for your film making class you go to another college it be something like that so it depends on the physical infrastructure also colleges in AP then you can go from one class to another but you know I have seen other Institutions of the event today leopardplayground play city like Bombay what they do is used the playground of the adjacent school and understandingstructure available in all the teachers are available to you may I want to learn Russian music But You Live Only student but that 20 people and 1 Russian music teacher practical case to case basis if they are very big institution their infrastructure and the Teachers know that so you may have also more visiting faculty for everybody to the payroll somebody wants to learn grammar and if you don't have a sanskrit department that you can call an external persons somebody wants to know how to make a big deal out of YouTubecall Ranveer you become the visiting faculty in Institutions is a lot of things that will get experimented because if you don't take in a student who can teach it and in a students are that you can create it also the entrepreneur Inside Me is screaming out Tech and it's screaming out video calls and screaming out video conferences I think that's going to be the big answer here is well like the going to use aspect of fast internet connections and maybe by that point 560 comes into play this is also called as industry academic partnerships are already in the industry or in the profession like you they can collaborate with the academy and you can actually recruit from the fresh graduate engineer John youtubers of the future you know you have to also get your next level ready to go to teach in the college of the school which is offering YouTube courses and the same people who is the best student you can hire indirectly want a Win-Win situationgorgeous so I just love the idea of a minor aspect in your degree also because I feel that a lot of kids kind of going to depression Hamara mental health issues if the land up in the wrong feel like again I didn't enjoy engineering as a subject you know I am not physics but not engineering to do different things and I went into an extremely dark place and it's probably why I ended up getting into alcohol and lots of students find themselves in that same zone so it going to help the mental healthlot of young teenagers are going to have the something to look forward to next we got off with his teacher training both the government is actually training its future crop of professionals with fantastic absolutely in fact teachers also required training you cannot be teaching the same thing again and again I know there are two things one subject upgrade teaching in artificial intelligenceget myself into School aur college so they will be trained in the latest II teaching methodology also changes for example I was teaching on a blackboard teaching the PowerPoint presentation tomorrow it could be virtual reality and today it is all online to teachers also need to upgrade themselves and you know the good news is that all the teachers are going through a lot of trainings did not that it doesn't happen in our Mumbai University itself so I had the Chanakya touch instead of leadership studiescontinuous teacher training programs also but now will be more budgets and lot of people will be coming and that will be focus area of teachers or not updated what will the update the students and even if you get yourself updated that should be but continuous training for teachers is a very important step at the national level also I feel there's a lot of human beings are that actually have a passion for teaching but really don't take it up because they think it financially notRebel audio not a glamorous as they would like anything that again the part of this whole overhaul is going to be creating a crop of a hundred Chanakya hopefully and then 8000 Chandragupta Maurya that's the vision teaching is the most respected profession and till now it was not getting paid a lot but now with the I don't care where the 6th pay commission lot of teachers are getting huge money as some of them are getting more than the corporates but you knowthe great profession welcome become a Chanakya yourself create the next generation it is money along with respect lot of people who make money don't get respect while speaking about new age thought processes preschool learning program so this is like before kg I'm guessing aur during kg so even parents will be given some kind of syllabus to train the kids at home like what is the thought process and I also I want you to highlight very quickly the concept of aanvikshiki which isyou taught me in your mentoring for me is a beautiful kaun sa that should be Re highlighted absolutely will tell you in our culture you are to understand there are three ways of education the first education is a parents and family itself II is a formal school college water and third is a friend circle please understand we actually learn with our friends in a seven-year problem you don't do the teacher you got your friends are Sikha de yaar Bata De let us go to the basic education staffand we have a prayer you know it is first Guru is mother and father tamev Mata Pita that's all Gurus so guru comes later on in the school to integrate your parents along with the children as small that you are ok so you tell me something about American system which allows the every country is not pluses and minuses in America The giver homework to the little children you what we called preschool and all those things where they have to read onethe child loud reading what we call before going to bed ok and please note this interesting it should not be from the school textbook so the parents have to choose one book they will rate and it is to be reported back it is locked that it is not that we can be Harry Potter it can be anything something value based on what is very important is that we have to get a parents in bata do you know what parents do the blame the education system for telling that you are you are not work rating the good education system and education system plays the parentyour child is like that certain that the very good interrogation coming back to the next question on which city it is the worst thing that every child should learn according to Chanakya what is anvikshiki the ability to think strategic thinking ability to investigate logical thinking somebody is very very nicely I was born intelligent education ruined we are going back to make children intelligent intelligent you know they have been with the how to sharpen your intellect that is on which are the good news is thatalso will be part of the school education system very soon with this new education policy as alias kg I'm guessing it's a preschool and school and forever by not what about sports that the next point is there any thought about like a physical education health sport Vikas and growing up and I am looking around me and seeing the health issues of people in the mid twenties I am value in all the sports education I had in school all the rounds of theball ground I did I do feel as a huge part of education is well Abdul Alim factor all this extra curricular activities co curricular activities everything will get merge with the new education policy and remember now the SSC results have come recently so there is a goal scored hundred out of hundred how did you get it because I actually got the answer to go beyond just writing exams to actually Singhtalent Explorer Soye sports is very very basic sports keeps you physically and mentally fit the sports is not just about in our education system of a writing exam I think we already have a that we have pity classes classes classes physical training exercises but if you want to take sports as a career as a sports management course also not coming up with very very important that we take the education system integrated with physical and sportand let me tell you my dear friends even to take sports as a career also it's a big thing already there are you know a games like to Kabaddi Kho Kho of course cricket is a beginning so Sports news not his physical fitness it can be a big time career also got was bored if you are interested in that I do think the world is moving more towards physical fitness the world of sports itself is becoming so physical fitness oriented like when you see your Virat Kohli versus that older generation of Sehwag and Aakash ChopraVinod Yadav like you see someone like you are doing that much importance to fitness which actually means that there will be a lot more jobs within the world of sport like Virat Kohli will have three four guys just for his own physical fitness one to teach empower 12 PCM speed that the big hope honestly and therefore we will be able to see definitely famous world famous Indian footballer other than Sunil Chhetri ok and will be able to see Indians in other sports so that my big hope I just hope that these policiesKodad changes will I do believe that will bring out the change because of the next ki point which is a reduce size of the syllabus and more importance to practical application based knowledge we could you elaborate is the minimum in this particular good life that you want to leave no so health and fitness is anyway part of an eye to see the government has already been promoting International yoga day ok swachh Bharat Swasth Bharat alsoimportant that we get into understanding that our health and fitness is a minimum and of course you can make a career out of it also so if you're looking to Virat Kohli or for that matter Kyon Hrithik Roshan he started a chain of gyms in and outside the health is going to be big and difficult integrated with Indian knowledge for example Ayurveda Baje Food Science ok all yogasan as a flexibility thing to the gym scope of creativity in the space of Health and Fitness alsophysical it could be giving or maybe make you know new new patterns like I know one of my students actually created a new model and the health fitness place called as chair yoga people and companies that sit on the chair the get back exam what you do we actually cricket chair yoga for everyone so it's very important that you can win over the headspace the fitness space that is going to be the future is pressure the youth of India needs to be healthy and fit you know that we have a concept India also make a career out of it choosesphone to tighten the biggest weapon in my own entrepreneurial carrier is my habit of fitness just keep your head clear keep to determine did give you creativity of the and this is genuinely because my childhood I was regarded on like the sports field so I just feel that this whole again the education system isn't just about the policy is about what the policies are doing as well when a child has free time when he comes home from school at 4 o'clock he should have just 2-3 hours to go play cricgo play football Hero to even go for a job even after 10 years old 11 years old so I feel that this changes Everything About lifestyle changes in the lives of parents kids so overall hopefully we'll see more sports people more entrepreneurs in this country we should and that's why we are supposed to go finally the last point I want to highlight is this single authority syllabus it seems like a Mammoth task it meOrchid in South Bombay will be starting the same thing as a ke din se Arunachal Pradesh remote coronavirus nachal Pradesh some remote corner of Kashmir some remote corner of Tamilnadu what is going to happen down this road and how does a government look at this situation I am very clear on this you know already we are moving towards it because the internet space doesn't see Geography S ok so I think if somebody is learning something inworld I can also know if I want if somebody is learning something in Pune which is supposed to be a cultural capital of our country lot of literature is there in Indian literature I think this thing will also help in two things one is accessible to everyone but also very important it will also give the choice to the teacher to decide in what methodology she or he wants to teach so when somebody stitching the same subject in Arunachal Pradesh maybe she can give local example when she is leaching and maybe Bombay can beexample of what is the monitor its of flat system with flexibility so remember it would be fun if it can be flat and be flexible to the teacher is the main person in designing this particular thing so don't just leave it to the government policies remember that teacher and student they have to also gel together to make the education system successful so what can parents expect next like as and now the government has announced this what is the nextthe parents should not expect anything that is where the problem is too much of Expectations on the child is the problem of our education system also because many times parents think that what they could not do in the past should be achieved by the students to the parents is that you let them enjoy their education loan stress the mouth in a do you want to have a happy child or just an educated child with a degree in the parents not blackthere was a beautiful or message that I once read never limit your children to your knowledge because they are born in a different error would suggest the parents that keep open minded don't go back to the past let the children Discover their own future but it's something you parents can do is two things support the child is experimenting face because they will not get it right in the pores go support the parentsplease learn from Children can teach you to things which you don't know like the digital technology in the children are your best guide for parents enjoy the journey don't make it a stressful journey for your child but like actually in the education system like there's a lot of young kids who read only for his got an excited so what can a fifth grade child expect like will stuff changed completely in 2021 or will it be a very gradual Trickle down like and the education system10-15 years what will happen to the policy says it's a long term plan ok it's not happen overnight and it's not about you know the switching of the button of a switch will be very lightso it's definitely people say you know I been that you can just some people that want to take three years it can be five years ok surface standard child should not take too much stress because anyway everyday everything is changing on Wednesday when you buy your latest mobile phone you think it's the latest with an exhibition and its gone with name is going to be very fast what I'm saying is that don't worry about what to expect go with the flow and enjoy the journey towards the change is definitely going to happen but God be positivegandi 1 year 5 years I don't know because that's all experimentation but only thing that don't register change accepted and be flexible and create your own future in this particular system I think this is a kind of victory for all the educational list in India the government has value no credit where it's due like these changes have like really kind of setup of parts for a great future all the entrepreneursTwitter are bowling happy so let's just hope for the best thank you for being on the Ranveer show today so and anything of notes definitely what I am happy maybe if I want to die someday and I wondered what did I contribute I think I bought back leadership as a subject in education system not increase followers that is what the Britishers Bittu ajino star education system was creating followers with job seekers I think my happiness meaning ofall of us should think as leader and education system will create leaders you be the leader of your life and create the change that you want that is what my message to his from Chanakya the Kingmaker beautiful thank you thank you thank you thank youyou be the leader of your life and create the change that you want that is what my message to us from Chanakya the Kingmaker beautiful thank you and until next time we will show you the next episode of The fiery motivational and full of knowledge like this thank you being on TRS once again so thank you have a great friend thank you
59,@Armaan Malik's Inspiring Journey From Bollywood To International Pop | The Ranveer Show 74,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY6FlX5jNp0&list=PLfNW_1ECVaThQynVe4QDlBM5S6Kzy8CeJ&index=60,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eY6FlX5jNp0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLB8X-SuAvxPzI5PQ37EDWQjNmgB9g,sign into my room and I told my mum and dad like I cannot do this shows and cannot sing the songs anymore I'm tired same songs and singing night after night Same lyrics the audience may be liking it because they had me for the very first time I am sitting at the end time and I am done with this is not what is inspiring me I know the songs are made me Armaan Malik but like to help with this I don't do any more shows and I took a break from everythinga to the am Armaan Malik in the house WhatsApp in my house in your house dude I want to talk with the story of the word aspects of you that I think I am fortunate enough to know that I am in the world doesn't know I am ready manringtone m m ready to talk about a lot of stuff so While We're Going to begin with your Saregama story I want no I will all questions from that part of your life is also going to who you are today are you planning to go abroad and lived there and create English music what do you think about life in general because people are really what do hand work dude usually think in like 20 places a good what your earliest memorygetting into the soul singing zone do like that come naturally to you so I was like round 4 when I lekin sirf talking properly I was singing how that happened in my parents so that they were like you know I think this guy has some singing Nandanam we should put in for classes and then there and told me in Indian classical classes and for your house trainingactor Suresh Wadkar institute but it was a fabulous class but way beyond my so I kind of went back there after a few years to learn stuff and I knew that I could grasp that but then I went to teacher Rita call and she is Kashmiri lady and she is the Guru that has made me 105 this is the one who kind of all those grains in my voicesing the way I do today got me to be a singer that could sing playback playback for movies because being a classically trained singer sometimes can be disadvantages when you are trying to sing film songs because the kind of training that you have is a classical vocalist might not translate restrictive some not restrict you when you singing a filmi song new singing for heroes in you need a different kind of an approach in Hindikind of dynamic and I think heavy classical training I did like classic light semi classical but added to heavy classical want my voice sounds so hard I needed that little bit of softness for the screen for playback singer and that's that how my teacher also my Guru planned to kind of teacher in that way so I would grow up to be a playback singer at 8:15 at 2825 and have had differentArman Malik versions of my voice what you what you like Saregama memory like when you are like coming on TV as a kid I hold you 10 I was I was 9 and 10 10 on the show that memory like do your just like out there for the nation to see your talent out so I think my dad wasn't very keen on me participating in on reality show he was he was wanting me to do my education andstudies and stuff like that even from the film industry he didn't want me to get the music's Sophia Leone and Mia member of another thought we would like you know why do we go why don't we try and let's see where you stand as a vocalist because till then I had sung for like Inter School competitions and at done fairly well there are now like wanting to challenge myself and we like ok I have done this state level things why not try nationalping and see where I stand in a good decision when you look great decision even though I didn't make make it past top 7 house in the top 10 finalists but it was a great decision for me because I learnt so much I was I was not be single that I should have been when I was on that show like I was under trained to be very frank I don't think I was at the level of the Other singers on that show they were much moredidn't they had song live before and this is my first time singing on such a big stage in front of TV audience and an obviously almost every household in India is seeing you with the Saregamapa is one of those shows that are Raat Ke Nau Baje dawai on a certain people see the show so for me it was pretty scary but I've I had to go through that to learn to learn how to be a better singer I think as soon as I got that show I worked so hardSundar show Gaurav I knew where exactly is lacking in a dream that department in strength in myself as a singer or something and not told you behold the matter was advise on Saregama but at this dude so you and I have a lot of friends from them and are not very familiar with the whole bollywood scene in general but I remember them telling me about you when I was in engineeringNokia and the guy said like you think like that were people would pick on you just because you are famous for like who believed you just with your family and you want to do and having a lot of attention from the that became like problem problem of Dudes and that this party actually why some people will I am going straight up dude like you have just people generally better about someone they are so that betting was going on about you and I got meeting I do for kidsprobably training and doing his own thing and his come back to school and deal with all this site so that will have you remember and yugyeom of Fame coming as another factor from this I'd be very aggressive and because people are jealous of you I am very well remember that and it's because of that face of my life that I was almost Guru live singing the bullying had gotten very bad in school I was in the 6th and 7th grade I think when you started andI was on the show I was on national television my school is very proud of me that I was born on a in a representative Bombay and representing them on such a big scale and they were both for Armaan Holdings all around school was pretty famous and I was legal attention happened because when you famous there and have I think because I am not that I think every guys seeking for girl attention and they were like ok byegetting it I saw that these guys are getting affected with the frame that I was getting getting insecure and somehow there was an atmosphere of jealousy and hatred and they started doing things to me this started putting it into my bottle bottle bottle like answer when asked to come back from PT class I want to get grab my bottle and drink it in thetrap net masti with whatever and it's just one of those instances I think I can't really remember all of it is going to very very deep a part of my head because I try to forget about it but it hurt me so much that I want to live singing and Express that to my mum and my mum told me that the one thing that if you leave not then they live in that the one thing that you should leave that the one thing that if you holdkeypad and become who you want to and you should be and are destined to be all this will be behind your own event Union care about this in the future I have to ask you thoda glaring question bullying carries itself into adulthood also do it does for a lot of your for me ever since I became successful I saw all the same people who used to believe me and we're not trying to be my friends again and we pahle with Armaantime you know all that is happen with me and I also played along with that I was told I was not like you know ki I am holding any gradual but I I forgive but I don't forget I know at the back of my head who is treated me how and what I don't hold it against anyone I know I've gone above that is no more a part of me but it didn't admin a very big way in a way where am Itop making friends after that I stopped interacting with people I stopped wanting to be a friend of someone because I thought Kiya everyone is going to do this to me everyone is going to believe me some one or the other is going to do something to me which is negative of it is bad for better not interact with people only I became a recluse kind of thing my own thing music for 10 years only music only study is only music music music music acchi what I need tobecause I just need I concentrated only on singing took my whole attention of a social life went for a toss up because I wasn't really meeting people wasn't going out and my my job demanded me to be in the recording studio quite a bit so I missed out on all the parties and hanging out with people do we have the recording studio again something I thought about you a lot is that you begin like at I think1989 teenager you begin properly professionally as an adult playback singer dudh usually for most Indian guys especially at 8:20 to you had this like wall were suddenly the societal pressure due to earn money and do something with your life most Indian to make a name for yourself and I remember going to the same way as at 22 and the first two three months that it to YouTube pretty intense EP 8 English it won't work out what you're doing it wrong it happenpoison office address is correct take something from inside you to like and comment keep working and used it would be able to handle all the shit 1819 I want to know what you did then do like as a teenager your son Leap Forward in the LimeLight you didn't actually go for a college degree write like you do I was a in first year of bmm and I was I was doing it not from the not from a place where are you want to do bmmthat the only thing that made sense to me and I found my music CEO of IBM was how is there inside college Shah was hanging out as a normal teenager when I was working on my debut album Armaan ok so we need to BackTrack a little bit before I went to college I had got a scholarship to do a 5 week summer program at berklee college of music in Boston and that's one of the best colleges of musicwhere is ever in the world and I got Honours in that and I realise that you know I want to do English music counter do pop music and that ok Bollywood is there but like that's not my calling and I soon as they came back home to Bombay after completing the course Asar making Mount song starting right in my own lyrics and my dad show me doing that and you like what you doing I would like that I want to create my own album love you sureI don't think India mein album artist those 2 wives and I don't think it's good to work because Bollywood is Bollywood you could be a Bollywood singer of you want to do anything as I know that this my dream I want to do this but that's at me down and set ki do the Bollywood root become someone really really big in India and then tomorrow you can think of doing something with this which makes sense to me now but that is am like we advise my dad telling me tonot do something that I am so passionate about but India is Bollywood it was consumed with with only for music so I can of dropped My Dreams of doing a pop album I did my pop album but it is in Hindi on to do in English one but I did Hindi pop album with Universal I signed a deal with them at the age of 17 which is a very big deal result is a dream label to be signed to when you are a teenager Justin Bieber sign to you knowin America so that the first step for a young single like to get into that world I know it is exciting as an artist to be signed available only to know that in the future you need to be in the but I think initially it is great to be eligible artist you get to know about the industry you get to know the inner workings Hawa label artist relationship happens how is music curated like workalbum was released I was about to release it in 2013 and got post to 2014 my mum told me being the marketing person she is that we need a Bollywood name to release this album because otherwise no one is going to listen to albums who listens to albums into I don't think anyone is this the albums in 2014 and we were thinking of putting out in the CD format and to be available in stores and I don't think anyone went out to buy at that point of time its type in the 90sBristol went ahead and didn't want to me need someone to launcher do you need a Bollywood personality to launch it should only person we could think of I think I made sense at that time was Mr Salman Khan so we went and met him use is vanity van my dad has worked with him for many films from any Bollywood movies and he was very hesitant that I go and meet himthis album is like you know I don't know why bother someone else like this ask you know for him to be part of it would ever mums like no I think it's a great I think it will be a good step for us and we went as again you know competing that had we went to his set you shooting in advertisement there and we waited for quite some time and then he came to his vanity vanMy CD insert so you know this album I would like to hear it and in his typical Sinusitis chalo let's hear it I like it it's nice I like this on the most and that song was a song called love you till the end it was the only English song on the album was I wanted 1 English song and likedHindi song in my Bollywood movie the next one bit is coming and I was like so that's in my album I don't know how I can remove it from my album and put it into a movie like don't worry I wanted it so happened that one of my songs from my debut non-film album sound not thinking of Bollywood at that point of time at all I was not think you doing playback singing nothing Ozone is thinking of releasing my musicthat's it like independent space that song went into Jay Ho which was his movie in 2014 and that's how made debut as an adult playback singer happened at the age of 18 and he in turn came to my album launch and launch Mein album and that kind of give it a big reason people had boarded and heard the songs of a good while this is destiny is also think that power of asking which is a very underutilized I think you know you gotok this is what my mum taught me and even my manager Ayushman both of the thought and both are amazing marketing Minds my mum is key to me ok who ever I have become today is because of her pushing her telling me do this do that she has always told me bhi shameless Anaspure max2max Kya Hoga Nahin ok no problem at least you vaastethat means you got something I think you have to be shameless and you could ask and sometime hundred knows about that one yes you can I think a lot of people scared I was also very scared like I do want to ask moment doesn't seem good like it's not it doesn't feel good to ask someone for work that no ask what is the Hamen asking this is also this whole concept of status driven society is a sweltering societies Indian Premier League statistical societyUnse my status will get affected by a lot of people don't like puchne Se Ki Vinod if we ask we might seem like a lesser of a person or whatever it is not that uses your talented you have certain things that are going for you you want a certain things from the person asking for and if you don't ask you won't get enough you never try you'll never know Cold Place biggest lion and fix youI was launched in Bollywood in a big way flip side of that is the movie tanked music the musical the tank music didn't do well at all was popular than cash on with people so it was touted as my big debut as big w because it composed love you till the end that track which became part of the movie and both of us for a year and a half or without work after that moviebecause obviously known to forget someone who's had the big debut but music Din cash on how many singers fade away like that would like many when you don't get too many chances in in special in Bollywood throat and is very cutthroat it is you either you make it or you don't make it it's it I'd hate to say that I hate to say it but I think it's you work a lot you have you have to pretend that hard work but that lives Sprinklewhat is very important I I believe in that and you forget that will Sprinkle I don't get it I mean that has to be some formula lete me now just talking to outside right now and you telling me about what you think about streaming platforms and future with their and what you thought on your mum is told you have an analytical had you are some genuine head somewhere I am I think a musical mathematician in my brain was the next step a mathematician in the world of musical businesswhat did you doing that one and half years that had to break out ok so for me as a single it give me a lot of recognition I Go Again The lot of fans from Jay Ho my social media started growing up as are getting a lot of followers I was on Twitter at just joined Instagram getting a lot of traction peoples are following in all it was very tough for my brother because once you debut as a big music composer and Meena brothers careersLinkedIn away because for as we both were just waiting and wanting to get our family up there because for a long time I think we have seen a lot of failure on that sent the success that he should have gotten hidden get so what has his role Ben in a mile and your life and have a mile and you ever had a conversation with a stick together and do some something that actually had this very open conversation with Amala mesad guys I think my time is done in this industry I don't think my you know my musical career is gonna hold on from your own and if you guys want to make a name for yourself in this Industry all god start working and assisting people assisting as like learning the job within we don't know like you know what learning music is diffactually being in the music industry in learning how music songs are made and how you sing in the studio is a very different ballgame all together like how they say you learn more hands-on and on the job then you can never learn from University is all courses whatever it is theory was always when you are doing the job you learn the most so I think that post Amal to assist composers and I was any Mein singing for a lot of composers who had a lot of techniquecollege in the studio and how to sing in the student Aladin voiceovers jingles all of that like for almost 200 commercials so that was a very very big space for me until the age of thirteen or fourteen when my voice cracked and didn't want any any Teenage boys is awarded Aniket voices from there on my different journey and become so yeah that settles down and told us that I don't think from here on my career was going to do anything you guys need toResponsibility in this thing forward and at the age of 15 for animal and me at 10:00 to hear that from dad was like dude we got to get shit done we got a unipolar socks up and take responsibility and money was in that good in the family at that point of time that was doing 23600 there like some projects but it wasn't it wasn'tlong we want financially strong that moment I'm just saying and doing his bit I started doing recordings whatever was coming into the house that the atmosphere I grew up in and I think much thought were really because of that when I started working when I started running when I started seeing what am I spending on because you're surrounded by older people no no because I saw I became involved in running for the famsolely on like I realise that ok if I am doing these many recording this much is coming into the family so that is a big deal big responsibility on my shoulders at the age of 11 and 12 and I am a child life overnight at think even today at the age of 25 I don't think I am mentally 25 much beyond because I've seen a lot of my parents journey my journey so up close and soI don't think any every kid like you said after 22 years when they think like ok chalo abhi kya karna hai I was the age of 10 doing it and living it so for me my mental state was very very different and we had to be hard to get the Family on track which we worked very hard to do and when this whole thing happen and when the songs Din 12 Amal was very disillusioned use like you know the next thing that I do ifwork and creating the industry and house like dude we started you can't think like that I know I know it I have to give my best now and the next project doesn't click add I don't have to stay in emo in the cell why do some business insight business and the next project came in the form of Naina the Sankalp Naina from movie Khoobsurat and if we finish recording the song just two days before it's releasedand two nights we created Naina from Khubsurat can we put the route of fabric action from fans and everyone and people love that song which movie did well I got that boost that you know I think that's still something you know there so that point of time both of us having this journey together even though he is a composer IMA singer what we will living the Dream together and then he got the chance to do Sooraj Dooba Hai from RoyI think the carrier defining live defining moment for the Malik family it was in my song I was in the singer of Arijit Singh hit song it but what that song that for our family I don't think I don't think any of the song is done that does music work like that as an industry where like one piece of art can one song in just changed everything for you man it's in terms of your opportunity Samne se recognition numbers everything you getold rounded success it's like it doing killing it on the charts it's you getting amazing fans on social media the traction is amusing you getting awarded you know you're getting Filmfare Awards getting all the big music awards for that it changed everything for overnight stay Patli the example of overnight success takes years to build exactly I mean if if you dost Amala the time of Jai HoVivo Z1 the brink of giving up his career will I know and I don't want to do this he was that he was assisting composer that when the time he didn't want to become a composer he was he became an accidental composer then after that album didn't do well he's like maybe this is not what I am cut out for them and that song became so big Suraj Dubai thing all of us just as a family were like we got this we can do this and you know you just need that one little bit of suckand then that energy comes on to everything that follows after that and from there on we had two three years of continuous snowballing bangles songs come your left right Centre killing it on the charge I started to ring in 2014 as an added Jay Ho 2016 added my world tour in US and UK played Wembley London witches Brew menu for any other search for me life changedSupersonic Windows 2 years but then whole journey of becoming Armaan Malik wasn't just those two years which a lot of people see a lot of people think he has a homemade ab you were then 2016 Mein he went on a world tour and he got this main songs in awards and recognition but this back story that a lot of people don't know that this be a build up of 10 to 12 years I like is when I grow up your available at Sonu Nigam ok ke of the Narayan and they becomepublished by singers Bollywood and it can of caps of the correct and from the outside that say something most people make about the music industry that once you become a good size paper kar shelf life kam ho jate FIR Uske bad the new day it's It's become stuck in India but why did you say that no abhi that was Indian guy who like go and create waves abroad or so with that from that the original name of Berkeley hairs soil tell you one thing while all this Madness was happening of bol do na Zara Main HoonTera all my big Bollywood hits the Andar Ka Armaan was like vedamulu still do not pop music counter 2 English music come on to International staff 1 in Urdu staff globally write my own song what's the thought behind at the thought is you get to be more involved in those Kanu songs and you would ever get to be on a bollywood track lekin Bollywood song A composer calls you he is written his compose a song lyric writer Sangathan you just come Singh and goin this scenario I am getting to create the song I am getting to choose what mood I want the song and what is the video like what is my image like what am I being portrayed as what the clothes and wearing the video all of that and that is exciting for me I want to become an artist and not just the playback singer I took this route so that I could become this what my dad had initially told me that you become a successful artist India become a star in your own country before you try to become star abroadit was very sensible of some to builder in to me that it but this inside car real Armaan who want to come out was waiting was was dormant for some time and then became the reactive towards 2017 and that's where I got there was a face where I came back from Ashok crying into my room and I told my mum and dad like I cannot do this shows and I cannot sing the songs anymore I'm tiredsame songs and singing night after night Same lyrics the audience may be liking it because they had me for the very first time I am sitting at the end time and I am done with this is not what is inspiring me I know the songs are made me Armaan Malik but like to help with this I don't do any more shows and I took a break from everything and did what is meant traveling to take this trip to do some self-discovery to kind of understand who I was insideunless you understand who are you can't put the route to the world is what I I think and at that time was very confused about why was was I have Bollywood singer wanting to do this for the rest of my life like Sonu Nigam like Shan like KK and all these amazing singers aur was a wanted wanting to become a pop artist of world Global musical icon and that was my dream while Bollywood has been such a big part of my careerArmaan Malik because of that I never want to lose that some identity even today if you see I am doing English songs but on the side I have my Hindi songs happening I have my Bollywood film songs happening but the true artist Inside Me screaming to be something that he wanted to do for a very long time and I want to search that I want to search the truth inside of me and that's why to that will break and when traveling and I give me a lot of peace lot of internal peace and when I came back I resume ice Bollywood showwhat I was doing was happy with it I guess I just need that little bit of self realisation Lil internal thinking how do you break into the American market or how you begin the process of becoming an international artist value in India it's very it's very very tough to be honest I just like you know any other artists you would think that you know just like how this Universal musicSony music Warner music in us that I Indian counterparts of them also hear the Universal Music India the Sony music India everyone in India thought maybe I'll take my English songs in go to the Indian counterparts and be like you know hey this is my English pop songs during you can speak to your Global partners in Bhilai ke we have this guy Armaan Malik in India who sings in write in English and wants to doGlobal single or album Odia what is what do you think of that I thought that that's what the route was an event when to quit of you Indian labels play the music but then see any headway they were not sure how to have that conversation with their with their superiors Indian us and then I realise like I think we're just go to the land where doll happens I will be here and think that it can happen from here you have to really I went to hellI went to a backstory to that is well I'm at a friend in in Bombay who is writer songwriter Honey minut Anya greed your friend of mine now she collaborated on all my stuff up until now and I met her at Cinemax and she happened to tell me that hate u i am in town for a week to catch up and write some songs and she came over the next weekvirodh couple songs and she told me that this is not stuff that needs to be hidden in their business to go Global innovation hard me sing in right in the back and that's where I she told me this you know why don't you come for a week to Allah Ve Jassi how it goes write a few songs with some of my right of friends and producer friends there and just see how the processes I somehow I feel like she came into my life problems as a blessing or something as a catalyst tomake something happen I believe that I believe that a certain individuals that come and be part of your life that help you follow your dreams and I think she's one of those individuals in my life and you don't want to come to Delhi for weekend let's write together with my friends in whatever and see how it goes it might not need any way just come in do something I went there rode rode a couple of songs in back 6 months nothing I was doing a Bollywood shows a gain my concert my song there in allcal does a dozen Indian dudh his name is Ankit and he has a music label in in Sweden in Stockholm and he has quite a few friends working Universal Soni abroad he happened to this demo music that created for a week and alien fasted on to some of these executives in the big labelsand they were not then showed interest and that individual was David Maxi is the head of arrest records which is a very legendary record label in the US and the rest Sunday Sony music he was going to London for the Brit awards and he told me that it why don't you come in meet me there and he is a guy who launched Jonas Brothers is the guy who signed Shawn Mendes It's coming from thewhen when you hear when you have some of that statue listening to your music and sing like hey this is some amazing stuff I would love to your more about you and see where this goes you kind of get that you can you get that we use right it feels right because honestly you might play English music to Indian friends in Indian people and they might not know or how to react to whatever they listen to English music of the Western Artist and remained on our react it coming from you but for them when when can abandey Jordan and they are and you know always this this this notion that Indian single don't get English singing write an archive pronunciation galat hai yah are they come out as wanna be that was something that I wanted to squash I didn't want that imagery only for an Indian artist I know there are so many Indian artists using English beautifully with an Ocean is Air India mein English mein Gautam log Nahin Rah Sakte ho I don't want that to happen that I am using singers in IndiaI was like you know I want to break that and if I do this right now they'll be a lot of singers behind me hold want to take this journey and inspired by my journey will have confidence in technogen forward because there is causing the reason Singh English to sing Hindi now because people are telling them ki nai we don't sound good singing in English so I wanted to change things not only for myself why don't you just changed my dreams are found to change the way people thought in in India as well you know people neverthat much importance to Western pop pop pop music in India address only for music happening or this completely in the music happening which does not a bigger audience for that otherwise in the mainstream pop happening where is the pop culture where Indian pop stars Dera Punjabi pop stars but there's no one who is singing in Hindi or English words and the Popstar from India I didn't see that happening as like this is a gap that needs to be filled and their needs to be an army of Indiasingles out there in the world to do this and this was my dream and then I went to me that in that executive in London and chatted for a bit and inked a deal with which Sony music Global at the same time I realised that you know you know a lot of these Indian labels did not go about it the same company Sony music and universal and everyone but when the whole Global thing happened and when you know they realise that wow I am a mothersigned Armaan and like this is this is a big deal this is India's moment so sometimes it takes a little bit of u tone life you know they may not see The Dreamers you presented to them but when they see the whole picture now I have the most beautiful working relationship with the Sony music India team ever in India which they actually other upon them in a play the music initially they didn't understand the vision of what was happening because it never happened in Indiathere is no one who has tried to break out globally and there is because there's no president people are scared ki Ham Kya Karen what do we do what is the route to take us know there's no case study as no one has done this before that we can learn from can a word that in the action what why of cups lekin that journey flight from India to the west was learning the cups not doing well you know I think it is a perfect timing I thinkabsolute perfect timing to have made the switch over and you know Hindi music English music all kinds of music was having his Movement in India listeners exploding streaming platforms are coming to India in a big way consumers listeners were getting so many variety of genres to listen to people listen to so many different artists I thought this is the perfect time to do something internationally because globalSpotify have now come to India and set up shop Amazon music happened so if they are coming here that means there sense to certain business opportunity here and there is certain there is a market here is something that can be made out of India that something you so I was like ok this is the ships are happening India's being looked at is one of the most important markets in the world they not only from probably other fields butI Noni my musical feel so I know from a musical entertainment field is becoming a hub hub just by the sheer numbers we have here the kind of people who consume the number of people the consumer music so how is like this is the perfect time for anyone to do the shift and then this whole control happened my first single and I got featured at Times Square on the Billboard the Spotify Billboard and that was just an drill for my first single to havekind of that kind of look is fabulous at Berkeley kids Dream man your man if it's like you know when that song released when when control released and it was available on these platforms I was jumping like a kid and add 250 plus songs released in different languages and never felt that excitement that I felt that I felt like this is my first song ever I have felt that that energy thatthe child is happiness and I think it it somehow was the realisation of my my childhood dreams my teenage dreams that came true and if you really manifested and you really wanted to happen it does happen thoda Le To Aaye lekin I think great war learn from the Western professionaland what were your differences but also in some ways I think I think every collaborative we aren't very collaborative your will learning to be but inherently I think we always have this notion of the thought ki why is he going ahead of me and vo Apna kar raha usko Apna karne To Ham apna karenge what is me and him do something together on your do something together andHam to Ek Sath Karenge that'll do really really well and I'll benefit both of us that kind of thinking you're not there which is now happening obviously you doing collapse with the creators if it's crazy I mean it's for me when I started working in the West with this produces and writers had a lot of fun learning to do you know there was 20 years of Indian learning that I hadwhat love can you talk word like like being probably being in charge of everything in a Vikram movie coronavirus there is more like ok to do this lets ok this line is coming from this dude that person is doing the guitar guitar part of everyone's putting that ideas in here it's like composes composing lyric writers writing is lyrics I am coming doing my singing and that's it everyone slottedit is like never comes off the best idea we want that even if a guy who's just scribbling on on his Notepad and comes up with one word which become the hook up the song that genius Idea coming from someone and everyone welcomes different ideas on different individuals that one room I think it's a great Synergy life again this site for the overall good they focus on the end product not exactly they focus on getting the songin the best possible manner by whoever gets the idea that need to be Le Om Maine hi kiya gana do you think like to migoset massage in the creative industry and that's why the end product cannot take a hit with that I feel Anna space for show this to ichigo in the Indian in the Indian space in the industry everyone wants like things for themselves be like ok I want the success for me it not good to them not working what issad success is never the scenario that never thought process everyone's like me me me Vizag are going out what is he doing is always in that lens and never has it been about collaboration never has it been about like a why don't we all create something amazing together it is also the other aspect of this conversation on bringing your whole luck factor that larger than the human experience there I feel that once you have the energy of being collaborative stuff start workingwhen you actually have a intention of a bro all of us were like Goa should works out should gross but the sun only experience after you and actually it's which online site also a lot of people we have this fake notion that Agar Ham Kuchh Achcha Karenge To Hamen Achcha Milega it's never like before Cecil to do something that you don't want to do you will get good that's never the case you have toliver naturally wanting to give something about wanting to be collaborative if that energy universes universe is very smart it recognises what's true energy was fake energy to trying to do good trying to good do good and not actually do good when you want and you mean to do good you can be easily differentiated you want you want will I go I have to do this so I'll get good from at your one of the few guys are met and my life in our industry who talks openly about like the universenumerology and I love I am a big believer in cosmic energy as I am a big believer that anything you do has there is a cosmic conspiracy happening to this is this is magical what was happening right now me and you sharing thoughts me and you speaking in our about our journey is about our thoughts I think it's beautiful and we take this for granted this model moment for granting universeuniverse is present in all these small moments and for me I have always looked out for the signs from the universe in the form of numbers I am a big level 11 believerbeliever and in those are even though like I am not scientifically in on that wooden plane 11 11 11 11 is to the listener I know what you're talking about but then it will backstory Swami needs number represents something different I don't know the back of my head I always search what does this number mean when I see it but basic the basic I think the promize around this whole number thing 11111 level is thatuniverse is trying to grab your attention to something that happening in your life and telling you that this is something good in this is something bad you need to change this you need to realign or you need to you need to be ready because abundance coming to you are those amazing things like my head feels a big change for you so I think these symbols you numbers I just wanna give one perspective on kaise kare liveyou look at the clock and it always 11111 not been known to the clock sometimes I am I am randomly this driving and I see the car in front of me and its 33322 whatever I am like why are the signs coming to me it's not one of the we like that whole week uca222 Aur 3338 Kabir and they could see all of them in one week and I try to I try my best to decipher what pattern is happening in Udaipurthat's not me I am crazy but the basic aspects of it is that the universe is trying to tell you something is time to bring attention to something happening in your life is trying to realign something in your life or is trying to keep you prepared for what going to happen so that's that's what I I feed of that that energy I don't believe in it A friend of mine kind of like got my attention to it and and after I startedattention to it for the first few times then it became even noticing patterns yah to happen to me it's not like I was looking out ki 1110 you have to be Forever living here not that is this randomly I just look at my phone is there will be no 222 talk to a lot of people about these conversations with options in Google in that what does this mean like that that's been my place Raigarh answers for everyone perspective on like out on the founder of the prospectis basically from the world of astrology I think of this conversation with you will do it once again for the partners + do it so when people think of astrology when you said it all you automatically think of the Gregorian calendar and Gemini a reasonable go for direct ok but as tall as a concept is really really really really really old in history of the world and early on the issue some Civilization switch to establish and someone is like tribes in some countries and the proposedschedule of India was established parts of Africa Egypt was established South America was established and I think some part of Southeast Asia was established and all these places this is a 50 thousand BC before even like modern legs of the writings that we have now we have decided that only up to the Indus valley civilization Mesopotamia that we think thatastrologers kaun sa comes from the Prehistoric ok ok and all of them have the same logic if you install this how to make an assault what is a logic the logic is like what we call Kundali and all today like as you know I have seen the charts and their solutions should you follow the how it works like I don't know ok so will do that on the Ford born in the room Dale map out the sky in a certain way like I willDil Se god image of the of how this how the the sky looks at the time you were born and that shaped Yahan how denotes your astrological sign and so basically will take a map of the sky and the map of the sky is divided into twelve houses and each of those houses represent one aspect of you as a person when you want one will be your personality one will be your mother when will your father when you do somethingJoker smile your death your friendships and partnerships of the basically represent different aspects of you know that is a map of the sky and our solar system has celestial bodies nine planets plus the moon and the sun the celestial bodies have the maximum impact on the earth now any object like this pillow you the light the mic always has its natural frequency begin associate like it's got it on body and always bring out of itthe bigger and objectives the more powerful the frequency observed so planet moon the sun is so much saliva coming out of very powerful electromagnetic energy as well as more subtle energies which has yet to be discovered by science and that's the basic logic of astrology with this is that ok how do planet actually affect your life your future as your life progresses the position of the planets changes in yourbadhiya born with a certain position of those planets at that time with a predetermined ok this is likely personality is this is more likely money and understood but it can also change so the world yoga society practice yoga for good person if a spiritually meditate on this become null and void eventually like and then it is what your hard work and your dedication and if you if you keep it may become slim all the Civilization spoke about astrology is this concept unfortunately of fortunately of all therecent India was the only one that kind of retained its old teachings ok so when you even before your open Imperial is have before the British came to go and others along your Pintu visited in the Silk route about the understood that these that have installed the system which they really believe in which they thought was accurate but he didn't exactly understand what it was added back to Europe and develop modern astrology what we know which is that they divide allinto how many signs are 10 12 baras not very accurate it's a very general it's not not accurate also it's like a very overview it's not like I like how sun moon rising your left of the Year 2 June 1st to 2nd that the Lord has done a lot of stuff in the cosmic worldbeyond science man and it also sounds only a love all this I am a big because I mean dude I think you had some experiences in your life and Italy experiences that finally determine what do you think that I think only people who make themselves more open open to accepting things from the universe are the only ones who are given this vision believe I agree I re I will you know the Lordclosed to the chapter of whatever of systems are they don't believe the desert does a cosmic power or some kind of energy the some above human energy that is happening that is working its magic in the world today or doing whatever whatever is happening is because of this I mean it is not I believe that whatever you do you do but there is always this certain power that'snew year that is a town want to say control it is it is kind of letting things function the way they doing that it's kind of a wearing things in in in the direction that it it goes in so there is this there is entity I don't know what it is even I cannot say what it is only don't know but as long as you keep yourself open to it that energy exposes itself to you and you receive more and more knowledge about and honestly if someoneknowledge of even be able to explain I cannot explain what knowledge I have learnt from the universe because it's more deep-set it's not something like this that it's not clear if very what do matlab Stayed Out under the under the law and the breadth of its probably it is ambiguous esoteric yeah I don't know I am very bad that I don't get these last wordsso basically esoteric it's not it's not very it's not expressed as it is its its is something that you can only feel and understand its inside your system so I think even I won't be able to share what I have learnt from the universe for myself but I think is a very powerful the very powerful energy if people know are open to Honey Singh in an open the accepted the guys who are deep into like astrology believe that the one22233 Arya forest house indicator your second hand alloy wheels for example your second house is the day to the lady in your life that could be a mum your life and today she needs attention or give you are doing something which which is longer than money is like one of the meeting creativity is for something I don't care where you need to ok you need to create what is 33 need to go and like give your creative work process and11-11-11 is usually stability you are doing agree on the partner on the on the correct your doing exactly what they meant to do in life it also brings me to my next question is that dude in your whole life karaoke only can you give us like instances where status just happened to be allocated this wasn't me was in my mehnat because people assume that hard work directly results in your success but that that happenswhich only 3 photos after experiencing success in your face to you still think not the bygones be bygones happened way to watch it happened with me a lot of instances I'll give you one instance variable you on the Filmfare Awards as you know it's one of the most prestigious awards in our country and once you have a Filmfare Award that means you've arrived my family at least my family as food like my dad in level 1 of Filmfare award or even than normalnot even invited to attend the ceremony sofa me animal to be invited to be nominated was a very big deal so I was nominated I had I had sung the song Main Hoon Hero Tera so that song at song and I thought it would be nominated but it was nominated so I was nominated in the best playback singer category and I just when that chairman because he was nominated for the for the royal Bheem in which Suraj Dubai is there are now like traditional ishow is going to root for him all the first win fail as it was all in all I am also what happens even as it comes back viollet super emotional then there is this this award that gets nouns which has no nominees that is announce the winner and I was getting ready to this Bounce because you like we're done with Amazon Warden like you know all of us just need to go back home in partyArmaan Malik wins RD Burman award for new rising music talent in for main hu Hero Tera and I was like wait what just happened I did not expect this and I was not in a mainframe to get it and sometimes when you are not in that in that zone and when life surprises you when you get things that you don't expect and the error 21 in the world now the youngest male playback singer to winFilmfare awards and and that will happen without me getting nominated for it just was a surprise award with you got announce think these are the moments that make me believe like I think the someone looking out someone who's making things happen and making you believe that this is all in all possible possible this is possible for you that some magical said that happens to you about and what is the again this is like one of those criticized the words on the internetgood enough word for it but speaking about spirituality I want to know what is the definition of what do you call spiritual it because I don't I also want to know I am also browse these two parts right one for the part you just described in this whole conversation with your professional paath correct and there is a second part that other purpose in life like and what we come on earth to do ok so what Armaan come on this through this is what is that sold within the occupying the body of Armaanthat come back ok so that the basis of it spirituality means that this is an old soul that come into Armaan some like it so parallel path to the one you already existing on so when you have that 111 222 that you see around ok that actually the other body getting activated where is where is that of the body inside it's against the world but the basic definition of itKarma game be a good person work really hard life with whatever working stay on is correct and the process of meditation and self-discovery Juventus New Zealand to like Discover yourself here that can happen when a person does like a lot of deep meditation dahlias with that effectively what are you doing what is meditation pulling your focus away from the real world just enter your breath adjusted to the one thing I think you are correct I'm completely abled the goal is to forget your identity forget that your singer forget the day on earthcome back to that one make yourself 0 basically you are exactly this is countable Ravikant this philosopher USA by Rhonda Byrne ok he said that meditation is like intermittent fasting for your brain because intermittent fasting a body is you start your body Heels same logic and Meditation by your back quiet and that focus to brain Heels so again all this like forward the spiritual but the broad definition knowledge you dude where's your like outlook on it so I've alwayskind of person that I feel that you know apart from my singing and apart from my musical career has come you to do good I feel like that's one calling of my life feel like I've come on this planet one side music obviously but also to share what I am have learnt what I know I feel like the other 25 I have no lot I am not bragging about it but you are a 15-year career in Odia25 I have learnt a lot I know a lot which I feel like and share with young musicians who are now beginning beginning and probably does illusion about what they want to do how they want to go about it or bring a certain structure to them and say that this is this if you do this all happened and and have done and what will happen so I will I had tried so hard that is spirituality it is it is it ok to define and because I don't know what what it is but Idefinitely do strongly feel that there is the side of me that wants to Doli help people and white people funny quotes and inspire people that so I got to have my own brand of Patanjali I'm so happy aboutgoing from jordans Pocket / your labels pocket to your pocket what are the different ways in which all singers in India on money through live shows like on the main money my mean income comes from live shows we would love if we would earn money from the sales of songs but we don't that happened in the West it happens in the West we dobecause no structure yet now it is come it's finally coming to shape like how they are you know right society is now that they were there they were there for a long time but they were corrupt for quite some time and now there clean up and they now giving royalty is giving revenues to the creators of the loans but it's not in the eyeway that it should be even the west the loopholes actually there are certain loopholes even the system where certain creators don't get compensated enough for their work your Tu Hi Ne love India is like very very very behind when it comes to being fair to creators current and yours will be different it will be different and will definitely be different and I can see the changes happening right now in front of me a lot of creators are owning their own songsGrand Masters so when the song releases of any streamed on any of these sites that money having shared money with the distributing partners give example 100 rupees is made from one stream this is not the real figure and aesthetically saying that you want stream of a song Bring hundred rupees 200 message to be percentage as we have to distribute to the guy who has helped you distribute that song to those different stores or the streamingindexes percentage is another percentage is the streaming site will take it on percentage and then probably cut down and you will get 40 rupees out of hundred that 40 usually comes to the label unless you own your own song to the label but it depends on how you structure your your business we valve in label artist for me until now I don't think all the songs that I have sung I could I want anything but cannot createsongs I am not a composer on the songs and neither Ramayan writer on the songs I am just singer and vocalist and performer but on my English songs I am contributed towards this like I told you that I am part of the song making process one part of the song creation so I am a writer and write a means person who writes the song as in the lyrics and the person who makes the tune for the both of them are called writers Yahan per there is a distinction thatperson who makes the tune is the composer the person who writes the words the lyricist it's like anyone in the room who gives a good line is a writer that's how it is and in Bollywood adjust Sangh so I am just singer son not entitled to those royalties that are created and not the creator of the song but there are altered as a singer you get for having performed using which are called performance royalties which a few society is outside of Indiaeven in a given in India there are generally societies that have come up now so the scene is changing is becoming better for creators for artists and who want to earn money from their songs to primarily right now via Noni from live shows how is be for the next one and half year I don't see any live shows happening given to the scenario right now so the popular belief is that as singers we get paid to sing a songand that's not true did you know that all know I am giving effect to get like money we don't get in Bollywood song songs in in the South Indian industries and in Other industries outside of Bollywood but I don't think any singer has gotten paid to sing a song by Arijit Singh beard me b two ever where I don't think we get paid to sing a songis understood that the song goes in your voice and song becomes famous you learn from the shows how to understand it wasn't the case earlier right I don't think so it wasn't it was so you know how I would like to change the industry it would be like ok for coming to the studio is a service rendered and my remuneration for my service rendered at Hawaii located in a very practical way of looking at it but here I think therenot very sure who they want to the test different singer with different singers obviously which is ok or we want to know who's who would fit the song best but I have come there two hours of my time have gone there so that is my time gone my food gone so I think I should be compensated for which any single wants to be compensated but obviously that's not the norm in these rules it's I will winif you ask it came to a point where they sometimes if you ask for money and become like both attitude Aage singer like it is sometimes it is sometimes produces more sleep composers and usuallythe money doesn't come out of the composer's budget or whatever I think it comes to the production house and this is don't have remuneration for single but you know I Am Slowly wanting to change that and I hope it changes but you can't really change it you can really it's like an unspeakable thing you can go into the students they like to listen this my bill for the info that did andwhere can I send invoice is not there does that have been part of the conversation of to sing the song and this play the song comes out in your voice so that when you when the song Humse miss you do shows in the new and money that soured is that how craziest Armaan Malik thank you for being on the Ranveer show brother Hasbro and handed down below make

60,How Science Explains Spirituality ft. Abhijit Pradhan | The Ranveer Show 03,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Zalqy9WP4&list=PLfNW_1ECVaThQynVe4QDlBM5S6Kzy8CeJ&index=61,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T4Zalqy9WP4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBrowvIldWfwcusEqnstnGp2B8sTg,one of the smartest spiritual conversations that you ever come across get a concept of spirituality and compared to prove in scientific concepts more specifically proven quantum physics concepts if you knew about spirituality on quantum physics don't worry about it we can explain everything in a very basic format so you can easily forget joining in today's podcast is Mr Abhijit pradan is one of the most talented man in India is well read man he want to India's top career coachesIndia's top corporate coaches is god of entrepreneurial career but on the site also like studying about all these three subjects we will be on the podcast a lot in the future this is a full episode with Abhijit enjoy yourself is called that intelligent only on my most intelligent friends in the house today is one of India's biggest personal quotebut for me the most well read person ever come across he was a spiritual side which is as strong as his business side Abhijeet is that like introduction of right lower pressure and then find the perspectiveonly makes me enjoyed far more than what may be most would be doing that really my biggest cake in life for those people in the subjects like as I can'tlike that was talking about the subjectlet's get lost when you had I think I wasand there was a time I think my career where I was facing got like you mentioned and my health was not total download downward spiral I had taken a lot of steps which is Kadal alcohol Karan smoking in all of that but somehow got persistent serving very frustrated single I am doing a doll Ram Kadam managing my diet health everything how is it that this continues to come back and for those who don't know what is uric acid levels going up and go so highcrystallized in joints in joints and becomes super painful to you can even like in a walk extraction pain Killers don't work it really really bad that is to keep coming back and someone just said hey you been to this you tried all maybe why don't you try Ricky like I think I've reached this turn of bottom and you know in life that why not so I think I got into it and I really believe thatrather than just react to the outside shape or what that spirituality is all about a thing for me I just connected with the essence of it and that worked for me it was what is the essence of what I think I took out immediately was that a lot of my issues were not just medical but they were things about it suppressed emotions are absolutely so those things was still there andtechnically dealt with them thinking that time is the greatest either so I think that that journey essentially got me to realise and accept that we don't necessarily have a process of dealing with him and that that entire journey that I went through allowed me to understand how I could deal with it and that give me a lot of empowerment and hope and initially I I just for me like this when I believe indoing something on it like full surrender there is no doubt as a special order was likely to get 100% and then see where it goes happened and the Fury part of this is that may be for almost here it is went so spiritual they gain again it get my wife and everyone around me the hotel that will guide you are using language like love in all that which is alienas that happened I send me started Singh similarities with science again and that's very sorry realising that hang on this wasn't like a totally different Exploration for journey which is totally kind of you know unconnected with whatever happened to be actually became the principal for me this and that is not therethe dots will connect in S3 happenedlot more from my smile owners of the parallels between biology and spirituality lot for the scientific world to discover and science of spirituality ultimately how the support each other and and if science allows you toIndian spirituality better so wait and vice versa so I think today effect with the funny thing right the Western world is now discovering the eastern and the Eastern world Singh maybe we didn't focus too much on the science wait but hey you know there is another way of doing it right thing to megive you guys all kind of contacts on water it was so busy touch healing injured in a particular part someone will conduct the registration over that particular part of body and related parts and also enjoyed and Can Heal you through the touch not scientific proof behind this but you experience what you feel is actually real is this something reiki practitioner will be able to vouch for the science of it according to me and does not provebut is that when you are Venom touching your nice a black nylon is injured I am sending of some kind of electromagnetic waves from my own body into a nice and that's kind help with the healing and the reason of electron this conclusion was when I had a Tennis elbow when I went to my Physio the give me like these Ananthapuram machine I don't know what is called the basic resend electric waves on your injured part and that actually helped my tennis elbow but not completed her feel complete that I am gone for a tree with someone recommend you try an alternativefixed My tennis elbow back then some science to this is no scientific to physically felt the killer inside me then also on the straight line that there are someand we keep administered to three point on the axis introduction to experience of something like a very successful Businessman 1 most well read signed human beings are never come across in my life I have dealt with something se non-scientific like it so actually I must go one step back when I went to my healthmission journey I actually got onto the journey of Discovery Osho Osho actually happened before breaking so and I think he helped me bridge the two worlds the logical and let's see the total mystical and spiritual bit so that those letters Type 1 and when I got into Ricky it and just Singh very well in that for me reiki was number 1 this whole acceptance thatenergy and do you allow energy or do you kind of hold onto it blocket Chaudhari ki journey was really a what I can let energy flow through me and it can do good not just for me for those as well so I think that was a great kind of realisation in the same paragraph to a sceptic who is like listening about spirituality part of it it like this you going to room and peoplea good Vibe right for sometime the Vibe can be hostel sometimes the Vibe can be very friendly and welcoming and warm exactly what is it what is all that right essentially we are antenna this if you just look at ourselves and tennis sensing something now we may not be able to conduct pinpoint wishes you know and the skin gets in audio waves excetra but what is that it is because we don't have a definitiontoram paradigm to define a Taurus sign ya exactly with this message this message has soft stuffed or not be absolutely that but you know and it's not just about being the same room for example you think of someone atom is called you what is it like to call it that but this something at play here and I don't knowquantum physics but I want but you know there is there is this principle called entanglement what is the basic it means when two electrons they interact with each other electrons are like the smaller parts of an atom atom consists of protons neutrons and electrons so electrons in the tiniest kind of brick house with me call at so the electron electron the water likerotating around this item will be the tiny and electrons when they letter to electrons when they interact with each other they suddenly connect and even if they are separated in one electron is in Alaska and the other one is in Himalayas what happens to electron asimultaneously to electron be entanglement and its a quantum physics things this is been proven by scientific experiment sec 17 so when you think of that same thing of hair thought of someone and that person connect Something Something getting communicated so in the science world they could call it is zero point field something exists and where essentially may not see itit could be electrons particles will be waves of whatever but something allows us to detect feel something instantaneously and that's that would fascinated me about the quantum physics world so that I learnt that your entire body when you break it is just a lot of memorynew face of great great great great grandfather which is in pass condom aspect of memory similarly if you're gone through some pain in life that mental Medical Store new head with different levels of physical memory memory and spiritual and emotional also when is a diagram in I don't know this is correct but some of the electrons on my skin may be sticking to like yourpart of your bodyin fact you know this whole thing is that we are a system of energy so while I was deep diving in when I got into the entire space there is another body of knowledge extra which really looks at and not just as energy systems but literally code information code with the code field around you and when we not well I will not feeling good thingswrong in that could just like letter in a computer system you have been all programs bol do something like that so centuries about getting that code back in play which is healingmusic shared with the view was because this kind of blew me away in an affordable than a way as well so I got into this rabbit hole of quantum physics from the documentary called what the bleep do we know what the bleep do we know is really about heavy look at the world from the Spectre and the quantum physics world is a very intriguing fascinating world which frustrated the likes of Albert Einstein because whatever he could measure prove in the normatomic world is everything goes topsy-turvy in the Sab atomic holder when you would deeper into an atom magnified it like everything before we get into the atom part is structured everything is frame orderly the moment into the subatomic world it's all chaosyes it is the it is the study of subatomic world so compounds example this you can see is any this is from the normal world but actually when you go into the atomic part of it difficult to see right you may not even see anything close to any is just energy interacting with each other that what an atom really is energy that it so the one beautiful part of12 Physics is that electrons can exist in Two States ok one as a particle and that particle is what lete allows me to existing to be seen or it can also exist in the form of a wave OK what does that mean the possibility and it says that only when their attention on this wave does the transform into a particlelooking from a spiritual perspective we have this thing that attention intention on something creates reality absolutely it really about that so otherwise the soul possibility but even this consciousness which kind of get diverted towards that does it become like you said manifested reality show that the quantum physics world to I started because of that documentary in if anyone can watch that does a beautiful primerwhat the bleep do we know full asterisk 17 of the bleed and so it actually kind of its not just about science or whatever it's really about life and it's time to end of the cold life from this extremely subatomic perspective ok so that got me into the journey because the various people who had gotten interviewed and that documentary on either return of studying each one of them and one of those people in mctaggart I think she was calledcute couple of books and one of the books so one book is called a field with really explain how that entanglement how we are able to sense people Hero subconsciously exactra happens and the second book was the intention experiment and intention requirement is that there are institutes very scientific Institute like Princeton resemble which has been measuring quantum physics effects for class 3rdall over the world and they have since they have installed these devices which is essentially measure within the energy is a particle wave when nothing is going on there is no stimuli it's a wave when this attention when people let your gravitating towards something that transforms into a particle and those devices detect that so thattiny particles which have a dual nature they can be both a light waves on the Indian particle normally the light when you focus on the particle actually look at them say for example would a staratoms which behave this way around it has a dual NATO I located right on the physical without context content has no value subatomic perspective without attention or energy or involvement and participation there is a particleif I am not thinking of a chair how can the rest of the world theatre the chair is because of the collective energy of psychology like this whole thing of the collective consciousness among call you and all of that there is also an effect of notice individual attention but group actually creating a tension in the reality manifesting so that the 911 example that you brought up from that book the intention experiment that I was referring to earlier talked aboutfive hours before the event happened the device is the dimension of the world picked up a massive search of change in energy 5 hours before the event which meant that something was floating or subconscious system before the end of the times when you feel oh my god something happen it actually happen what is that is just bought oh my Godis you are is blessed with some major mystical pass or maybe his stint in the question of how are you to the Energy field or not just so I think perspective I think it is important to realise that everyone has it is a question of tuning in your you might think he can do ithe has fantastic intuition I don't which honestly is it because it's it's really about helping so I was tuned out it so that pretty journey actually help me tune in so I usually ask people what they played inwhat is your take on the process of spirituality and becoming spiritual in your career zone give you the first one is this wheel the treadmill of life that pays keeps us going on and on and on and on we'll be scared to get off it singer oh my God if I get off it I will lose outjunior spirituality eclipse start putting in that pause between stimulus and response Awareness of Venice is a tool which is not taught in school in US being aware of who start with self and self awareness is the toughest actually because it ok and normal to see someone else and in a make a comment on it but to really see yourself need you to pull back because you also haveabout yourself and that is option could come from what others say about you version of yourself in your headI'm yours is question about how does that help in the career progression is really about this is what works for me this is what happens to me when I get challenge and this is what if I do this can help me overcome it is a very important part of it because what is spirituality exercising gym your essentially taking your stressing a system to get stronger and stronger than putting input subsidyso that your body and your system response better spirituality as to play that role it's your life gym which can helps you ok have gone now how do I get even more resilient more resilient more resilient intuitive more listening as a post to just reacting talking giving out now I read onlinef&o with spirituality and one common theme upgrade across all the books by Link the top of Yogananda Paramahansa krishnanand Osho people like that I really looked up to the common thing is that it is like exercise spiritual The Spiritual game and the parallel game pure karaoke your life and the way to progress is regular meditation the topin developed in its kind how many coming to brain becomes much more intense 5 used in the change in families in the change in their loved ones and I know the result of my meditation what is your take on thisusing tools Vishal talks about how every single billionaire in the world has this meditation habit nowyou know something to follow and when you have the right role models doing it you get a lot of behaviour which follows and what happens if become the water cycle so when you have people doing this it is much better than something it is like questionable then following that so you talked about the given to the quantum physics with which I am not even attempted to explain but I think meditation today at your last 15 years has had a lot ofbroscience validation of how it affects brain to body exercise 17 so I think that thanks to I think a lot of work that the Dalai Lama institute in Kurnool the neuroscientist work and partnered with them to see the little the physical impact on the changes in the brain that happens to people who were not regularly melted so I think that has given a lot of confidence to the normally letter sceptic only western wearnothing on this is now good enough to integrate in a way of life example Silicon Valley many years back they got onto the meditation bandwagon and thank you both of Google who created so search inside yourself programmingknowledge many years ago they located at the productivity hack my point is that people months ago but does it take away from its ko I would say that if it encourages you to do something better than what I did before Soviet so I think to me no Medowhich platform you are coming from if you are affecting affecting positive change fantastic so you know it is why and what you know so I think Tumi good things get kind of mirror practiced and followed to reaching this fantastictop probably get back into that whole thing of attention to yourself to your surroundings and therefore I am saying helping reality manifest much better together we remember waves possibility and particle being that physicality so I think meditation actually allows you to remember your photo of these experiments and in fact this is also covered in the what the bleep think like that where they had meditateliterally changed the pH level of water right sadaiv measured the scientific this is not confirm experiment and and I don't know your there but even one level of change in pH is message If the body will die so they've actually like 4 meditators together and focusing on Hero whatever your water container and the activity changed the pH level so that the powertapping into something very fundamental which is where the quantum physics becomes in which is also ahead of modern science models are so now the peopledo you know beauty of life is not in the know but in the mystery n k n o w n beautify uses court in all my workshops are they do when you are in the know your mind is closed or not receiving Antennas tuning in but when I am in the mystery you are in curiosity stage and that too is very important because the flow of energy changes andTumi meditation allows you to step back and allow that flow and that curiosity in all those processes in vendita practice legume mentioning the practice is only going to turn off kilo DU good for you if the one of over now go melted and become superstar tomorrow exercising the same thing with the ritual of exercise is more important than you knowmy final question due for this podcast is that if you can tune back in your career coach mode in The Spiritual development what would you tell an 18 year old today he should know in order to expand is my next next to the best vocabulary from the mostpeople have this one role model and I think of passion there in all of that and people following it not writing if I would tell anyone starting of singer hang on always triangulate your source of inside which means that meet your role model is saying this but is there another perspective behind it and I think Tumi most people just get into it with blinders follow follow follow follow follow then learn in probably the mostand some some loan and grow but alot don't and then the kind of problem there the role models of more the versus blame themselves writing to me this whole thing of cultivating this habit of pulling back and thinking is another perspective it may be the opposing perspective why is a deposit on that this is wrong or may be readily and to that I think to me that I'm very important part of any oneentering the game of life that's what I would honestly you know get that it can stick the boxes of spiritualityAbhijeet episode going forward and link all Handle download to follow him anything else account link like specifically I want to see active pure

mind I'm take a brief value as a stepping stone but don't leave your dream hold on to it if the bigger the dream is more opticals might rising your path but we should be prepared for it should be prepared for sale USA should be prepared for imperfections it all depends on your sideno mind your because your spirit has no age you are self so you can relate with any age and Urs list Gurudev Pranam welcome to the Ranveer show how you so very good how are youdoing good is genuinely on having you on the show so you are one of my earliest influences when it came to embracing the idea of spirituality in your life so it's amazing talking to you are doing such good work you are spreading through social media and influencing through social media use thank u so that means a lot just trying to get people toat the same time work on the inner selves and smarter to get definite adding I think that's an outcome of working hard and listening to the right kind of conversations on sleep so I really want to dive straight in I have some in a friendly way heavy questions for my first question is what is yourmemory because I feel that people born with a spiritual purpose in life some of the early memories of very crucial informing the character for the rest of her life and we see a lot of people following your word following your actions so where it all began for you like from this lifetime of yours what is your absolute alias may be that affected your character or something well I am still withwhat I was before and I am like that now also from my very engaging and spirituality was like fish to water for me nothing new about it and in my younger days I spend the time with all the elderly people and now as I am getting older and spelling with young people that's all that is so what is the difference between the young people of today and the young people of those Timesyoung people of today are the more mature they get satisfied by all the all the things that's going around them much earlier than people future generation back in a few generation by their personal ambition for people spirituality ke much later now spirituality hasCharlie is coming to young people why is that happening dosa like why do you what is the requirement of these times and now you have bullet train so very fast the same the human beings also they are able to mature muchearly age for something higher in itself like the planet we live on and this life that everyone experiences I honestly feel is an outcome of the people who inhabit the planet so if this generation is getting spirituality so early in the life so many young people are embracing it earlier in the life do you think that they are heading into a better time for the planet oryou know how negative people how they would think that the heading into dark times and young people they are less self is the less consumer is in nature 15 years change a people want to do something for Bigg Bossyou know they have seen all those with wealth and fame all the thing and they see their lives are not so happy so there is a natural seeking of happiness in people write and it's it's a good time I tell you you know only intelligent people see spirituality youngsters are becoming more intelligent so that they were seeking is higherwhy do you think if user exists as a concept in rejecting this idea of a higher power or a God of the universe where people think too kind of outward the don't wanna say they don't value anything other than themselves where is this idea come from why does it exist in the first placeand government there was a rebellion against the organised religion in the West especially in Russia and then that the Soviet Union prosper when it became a huge country with the same as its Central Coal India definitely got influence India was closedUSSR Soviet Union and B started the appreciate we were amazed looking at US and the way they have progressed and they said religion is a mafia and we not it because we thought a power that is because our religion not do not everybody but most people that generation educated lot hot with this is a way of lifebut when USSR disintegrated when the swimming pools which were once upon a time is Church became Church again the whole concept of atheism was out of the window given in China then we started waking up to this reality so because you have been responsible for convertingmany people mindsets transforming peoples mindsets how do you transform like the most intensely negative mindset into that journey of positivity what is that first step is positive even any one of our teacher when they sit with them I said don't worry about you whether you are a Teesta believer doesn't matter you can be anything stocks on can be a good personyou don't have to force believing in yourself this is something you don't believe in God but you cannot say I don't believe in human values you can't say I don't believe in decency in happiness in peace and the values that uphold humanityif you are honouring yourself if you accept these human principles that is good enough and for that you take care of yourself take care of your mind take care of a body your breath your emotions know something about yourself in our workshops Art of Living WhatsApp you don't talk about what we talk about human existence we have 7 layershuman existence body breath mind intellect memory ego yourself so knowing a little bit of yourself then you you know how you get on to a different platform all together in your life beautiful so I have to ask you the burning question in many people's hearts which is so what is happening around us because I am sure you in your lifetime in thismovie of you may not have seen a situation like this why is this happening so what will be heading into I would just like to know what are you thinking about this whole situation the covid-19 coronavirus situation it now but it's not 100% the good thingeating itself know we can lock a cell down for sometime I never even dreamt of thought we could do it that we should have a planned lock down every year for one weekby listening to the peacocks on the street and whether such a Bangalore weather has never been so good since last 50 years I know when we were kids we had such a beautiful weather here we never needed in air condition or even a fanvery clearly from many cities of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir what is got itself it on the river Ganges and Jamuna have much pure water now look at the way we were there and then Chidiya you see in Delhi there are in the city the sciencenature coming back to Russell this is very good because such a few quality of a number one people everywhere in the world I don't get time I don't get time now nature give you lot of time you have lot of time and do all those which have been postponed and not wanting to dothing is you got time to spend with your in intimate family close family living in the age of Technologyopen some twenty years back just imagine what you have been the situation impact on daily wage workers and people small time business people many businesses have been really disrupted now this is nothing short of a world warafter world war during World War II world war everything goes to flat just flattened you have to rebuild it we have to come up with this new spirit of rebuilding the economy and now is not the time for competition but for Corporation corporate help each other come together and build rebuild the economy this is the challenge we haveAnshu name should this theory of covid-19 go away it will be there for sometime another 6 months to 1 year people will still have B12 medicine is being found for it it's like common cold and people don't worry about it so what kind of world are we heading into are you optimistic about HIV positive about the world we are heading into something a little bit nervous in terms ofmaybe some men might feel that as again and examples of how you think this virus which is less than 2 grams per 1could bring the entire world to stand still people had to wake up and see what is that we have done where are we what is the priority you know any one thing that a person does somewhere in China can affect the entire globe then we cannot ignorehow how strong are all connected so we have to take care of herself and see no on to word experiments Like This can happen anywhere in the world if it is a natural phenomena that is different but if it is a man-made phenomena the ethics committee of the United Nations will wake up and put their foot and say we cannot do such thingsso I've been someone who eat meat most of his life and I enjoyed me Twilight baby since I went deeper into my spirituality for the last three to four years have gone completely vegetarian as seen the difference that meet my body my mind my spiritual journey do you think the world is heading more in that direction and possibly covid-19 is a kind of signal from the university as a eating meatvegetarian food all over Ranveer when I was travelling 40 years back in this in the 70s and 80s were hardly there be any vegetarian stop anyway you have to carry everything with you approach to get vegetables fruits were all there but vegetarianism was not the norm of the society peopleRai Bros but today people are taking to vegetarianism because they found it much much more useful to the body and our the makeup of our body is such that it is more suitable for which state but how do you convince someone without having experience in it because it lacks an experience is it for a while then the underwhat you speak so but how do you convince someone say it but then they will be related to you should talk about it more I am going to take that is one of my homework pieces from you but like what I willss0 when you eat a mint chewing gum how it makes your mouth feel cool I feel vegetarian food does that our entire body and your mind it just schools on your body and use on your mind that you are able to think of a lot more sharpness and clarity and that's what you pretty much need for happy life idlyelephants are there and horses elephants bulls there all vegetarian dinner we have to cute elephant share in the Ashram you should see this they are they are so cute there always there vegetarian and their Deccan give this message to people that look where all vegetarian and their MaestroI hope that people catch that message the weight should be caught so but again it one of those things that you only truly understand after you put your body through it and speaking about spiritual journey and general I have one question for you which is that you know I am sure that the way you face prejudice about you talking about vegetarianism is a lot of prejudices you have to face as well just genderpeople some people might call you are God mein no you know you some negative terms like that and put you in boxes so what is your message to those people that's what I want to ask you because I think if you practice yoga few practice spirituality I completely understand too hot and the place that you come from so what is the lord will completely shut to that were probably watching this podcast till this point so what is your message to thempointing talking to them people who criticize without knowing you are only showing that they have no value for what they are saying if they know you and they say something that has some value such people I don't even go to say anything to them I just smile and I have I am used to the sort of prejudice as saying that and loss part years but you know the kingI want to eat for too long I am talking to 40 years back when we started or art of living yoga means in the western country do you think it is something not put common mainstream people thought yoga means someone with bus Asus all over the body is standing on one leg somewhere in Allahabad this was the ideaused to have you know if so then we call Art of Living people became curious what is this letter C and when they started in minutes we don't do much yoga 10-15 minutes of yoga and little breathing lit meditation knowledge about life and opened up so today millions practice 2 billion people are practicing yoga on the worldso when the world is taking to spirituality slowly in O in India also people who are assisting it will also follow some of the big movies that they go to English movies like Matrix and Inception all these were based on Yog vashishta R script so you knowso do not like any spirituality De enjoy this movies to there are ways the spirituality enters into somebody's life if they don't want to interest rate their interest somewhere around about through this movies most of the movies in the sun made in California best of America spiritual dialogue you will see people thereit's a common thing meditation is the most common thing now universities around the world have adopted meditation is part of that you know per credit hour Art of Living is per credit in 58 University Cinema show some time or other people willthis is being the history of the world you know when somebody is alive people don't recognise them is thrown at them they make all comments when they are gone then district appreciating life this type of people some with lot of prejudice others are overcomingin this country before a Prime Minister Narendra Modi started going visiting temple and very proudly saying that it's OK to go to temple falsely created in the name of modernismDin New World opens up in front of but what happened on rigidities vanishes so you know all these different spiritual parts everyone knows it eventually leads to that same goal of complete peace complete surrender so keeping that in mind I am going to ask another very hot question you are one of the most respected spiritual people in the countryone else was extremely respected from a spiritual perspective the Satguru ji I've also had the honour of interviewing him social have you ever interacted with him what is your take on his work how do you all view each other and doesn't matter what's good butNahin I missed bring the inner peace and happiness bring the transformation people's life for mind is closest to to learning to furthering the very purpose of a life to spread happiness we need as many avenues to open the topcourt under the closed my need to be open and it can happen through dialogue to talk through practices and just through general knowledge if people are open to general knowledge is there not having holding on to the prejudice then there is so keepingspirituality again is the theme of the conversation I feel when people enter this part of spirituality that is certain things that the gain along the way to peace and often for the youth and this is something I have learnt through my own Kariyo you need to pull them into spirituality initially with the promise of gift you need to tell him a lesson you will get these things from spiritual practice so so can you elaborate a little bitwhat does initial gifts are eventually it is complete peace and being happy with the way you are being completely grounded but on the way to that point what are the tools that the world of spirituality gift you what your correct breathing patterns gift you in order to benefit your life in order to benefit your career another

the byproduct of this practical and if your heart is broken these practices can fix it just a few days time within 45 days you know you will be normal ready to go on another journey that something I experienced as well last year I had a bit of a heartbreaking my own life just took a week off from workspend my time meditating and just you know kind of put the learning that I had over US into practice and that's something I feel lot of young people don't know that your body and your mind the capable of a lot but you need to know how to play those instruments you know we are so stuck in small things we don't realise we live in a world of 7 billion people and you have a lot of choicepossibility your life to do these things are what I would say are the first benefits of this you know you create an atmosphere of positivity and love around you feel that love yourself so I feel somewhere spirituality is like a shop no and fatherpencil of your life your life and your existence of pencil spiritually can shop in that pencil and make it more aesthetic more beautiful more useful keeping that in mind so someone like you who has been embraced spirituality Sanso alien life at this stage of your life do you still have to practice any kind of meditations any kind of spiritual practices and if you do my question is what happens to you in your meditation flight what do youtoday I don't need to do anything to do something but I don't have to do anything but today if you sit on a meditation what goes on in your mind at the end of the meditations because honestly I am at that stage where I am just beginning to shopSati and my meditation is always a bit of prayer a bit of you know I ask for blessings from God from the universe what is it for you at the end of your meditations I don't ask anything for myself I am here for everybody I am my life is for everybody so I just blessed everybody wish good for everyonebeautiful so what is your opinion on the law of attraction on magnetism of manifestation when you don't cry for it is yours but if you are absent for what should be the mindset of someone who has strong missions in life I want to do this I want to that are not supposed to visualise good it hold on to your vision you can havedream11 dream for yourself one dream for the nation I would say have to dreams 1 your personal dream one thing for yourself and have one dream for everybody for the nation where you want the world to move if you're my face when you fail yours but never mind them take a brief value as a steppingdon't leave your dream hold onto the bigger the dream is opticals might rising your path but we should be prepared for it should be prepared for failures should be prepared for imperfections if you are not accommodating Imperfection in your life if yourholding on to perfection you will become irritable and when you are when you become irritable your success will be a perfect reality so to have that control on yourself I would say leave some room for improvement that will increase your patient number one thing is an open mindkeep your mind open new ideas make them at any time to take you towards your goal should be open to new ideas 2nd 3rd walking Timber team owner the team and Honour the people who help you to move in your towards your goal this is important in our when we respect and Honour freeyou will get that many times for many times in written to you have some big thing to achieve you need the help of many people and so you need to have that you delete this have this confidence know that there will be opticals and no you will be able to overcome them I think this should be enough it's these four things together are stronger than just sitting inlisten visualising about where you want to be a write some people that is ok but this again and again putting is a formation may not be as helpful as it is been thought two decades back to savetell yourself I love myself I love myself I love myself so that your self love will grow in no but I have personally many people who went on to this part of visualising and giving a formation to themselves they gone really the other way around contrary to that you are in Mumbai in Mumbai right yes or nodo you have to remind yourself everyday I am in Mumbai I am in Mumbai no want you know that's it you know it is there if you keep repeating to yourself I am in Mumbai I am in Mumbai everyday that means you have a doubt whether you are not in you have a doubt that you are not in and not in Mumbai right only some there on the other side increases the doubt in YouTubewe of visualisation our ancient people here in India said they said take a Sankalp and drop it take a Sankalp and have an intention and then offer it to the universe don't hold onto the you think in your mind ok I want to go to Nasik so what do you do with that one thought you take youryou drive you don't repeat the whole way through Nashik I am going to Nashik I want to go to Nashik you will end up in mental hospital so you have any intention and then put attention and manifestation will happen if you focus much more the actions in the thought you don't need to repeat yourself this thought into yourself again and againtoo many times can a person so I have to ask you because there is this whole revolution that going on with the youth of India Today especially online people of quitting concepts like p********** completely people are embracing concepts like celibacy there is something called the nofap movement which is again basically brahmacharyam and that coming back to the youth of cities user can you explain the role of celibacy in spiritual growth asmental growth like what does it do for a human beings mind that happens when you have contentment when you have lot of energy when you get that energy of bliss of Samadhi whenever you had a taste of Samadhi celibacy happens to you naturally you don't have to forceyes moderation and celibacy has its own benefit it is its own charm it is its own energy level definitely that so I am hearing from you for the first time that there is such a way that in the youth I think this is a cycle you know in the world sometimes when people go through this under different tendenciesPandit Ji ko even for example sex for people they don't do it all the time I don't think anybody does it all the time they have season they have you know times when they feel the earth in the pod no unfortunately we think sex is bad sexiest should not be taken as a bad or a scene in this country it was not seen as a Singhwestern thought we adopted in this country for several centuries now at the same time brahmachary is considered to be a breath and valve which is good and which is the father of yoga this is very important and makes a lot of sense the same energy which gets transformed into love it Swan energybody that that is either sex energy or converts itself into love compassion and grow so people who suppresses sometimes they become very angry the same energy gets an outlet in anger but is the same energy is channeled through meditation as love and compassion then you see that you you are in blissall time you don't have to make an act to experience bless there with you with just a meditation I feel that celibacy combined with the spiritual practices like meditation like living a clinical life that is the real ki and it's not just abstaining from sex of abstaining from masturbation or somethingdance on you then it comes to you from some other distorted form inside of you become irritable angry emotional imbalance sometimes you are not so clear in your communication thinking of this sort of psychological issues will arise out of it if you want to practice celibacy you must to Yoga meditation then you will see it's not init is become a natural thing for you you are not forcing something on your own so the parallel way of Thinking could be that after the age of 25 if you get married to the right person and if you are engaging in sexual that person you are childline in the sexual energy as love energy within the marriage that would also be correct rightIf you are using your energy into a creative channel you are putting it into just creativity or in service studies sex is not a botheration Ato nobody is bothered about sex when they have exams at those time they are so busy and when you have any important machine to accomplishing lifesome issue that comes into your head similarly when you have when you are serving people in our love and compassion in 2 6 is not an issue at all but when you are focused only on yourself your pleasure it's natural instead you should not say this is bad or same to get out of the natural Instinct on it and then go beyond that what I would say that beautifulso I mean you know I feel that when you do meditation when you do good in the world even if your work impacts the world all that causes spiritual growth but is it correct to say that when you are in a very loving relationship or when you are in a very healthy marriage or when you have children and you are giving the children love to you grow spiritually through those processes as well like when you are spreading loveI had to service how old are you today how are you today in your heart and think you are about to anyone so I am I am going to but I am asking you about the physical bodies a and the reason I'm asking the physical body is that I want to ask you as you age as you growlot of people lose out on some of that physical energy possibly some of the mental energy for someone who's been practicing the Sudarshan Kriya aur multiple Europe spiritual practices for so long what has it done to your mind and your physical body today years of practice what does it cause for you today you tell me how you look about 45420 year you get a 20 year demotion in terms of your physical aging all the time but this is the longest timeyour mind is more active your body is more active than the average person who shares the same physical h i don't feel I am I am I don't feel that at all and 64 I just become in I am just like a mirror I just reflect our age group I am with I am one beta I don't have never felt out of place are a foreigner in any country not people ever thoughtforeigner in anywhere in the world they feel I belong to them and I feel I belong to them and same here also with age group any age group we are interact with the love me and then teenagers we have a whole bunch of teenager and all other programs you will see it's all filled with young people more young people than elderly people I'm quite comfortable with every age groupdepends on your spirit know when you are because your spirit has no age you are self has no it so and if you can relate with any age and you are each list I am going to ask you a slightly tough spiritual question but this is something I've always wanted to ask specifically you followed youBabli since I was 14 15 years old at one at first discovered you and I constantly seeing that you give out a lot of positivity does a lot of positivity in your voice with your intention with your mission and I would say the same thing for Satguru ji but also you know when people that question we spoke about how society will bracket Someone Like You Yoga guru as this person is a God man of this they put ads on to you that has happened because there are other people whocall themselves Gurus like I feel true Guru is called Guru five people you know yourself that ok I am a girl I am gonna sit on you guys we measure the the students always to the group but inside a lot of people who say that I will sit I will be of Guru now and they are the people who spoil the name of yoga who spoils the name of spirituality in the world and also feel that happened because On The Spiritual path you are tested a lot the moment you start spiritually advancing use are advancing andGod of the universe throws tests at the people who get pass those tests are the other ones like you like Satguru ji who actually positive why is the environment but so what goes wrong with the other people because people who have a bad name have spiritually advance somewhere flipped of the part so what happens there and that under your the end of the bad reputation of the spoils the name of yoga why does it happenthis is there in almost every feel you know there is a businessman in Mumbai who to sold plastic in the name of diamond will you say the same thing for all Jewellers in the country if you do it it's not write essay of work some you know people do exist in all different fields there are doctors who stoleand if you doubt every doctor to be a Thief kidney thief will be suffering only you right to among hundreds of thousands of others and Gurus on this planet in our country and full of people have gone into scan and this is out of their greed orwhat happened a traditional seat traditional Peeth of Guru and they were appointed someone into that they were not ready for it and they were abhi bachkani Rahi their child if they did not realise the responsibility mistake and for their mistakes you should have compassion for themthat mistake anybody all outside anyone else would have done it ok of course if people and responsible seat of the day mistake I usually say they should get twice the punishment as a common man would get these are very few in number even Ravana ke Sanyasi dress up from trust to kidnap Sitastring of Ravana from the time people Vijayanagara empire was finished by 5 Sadhu people 5 of the bahmani Sultan Sarvesh their dress themselves as those they came and as the king to come alone when they came they beheaded in this I want to speak to the king alone because we are sannyasis so he went thereone day the entire Vijayanagara Kingdom was finished one day without water in spite of having one lakh elephants and thousands of elephants and one like soldiers this type of people are there in the world and so I but luckily they are finishedin number we have to take that also know what ok so my absolute final question to you on this podcast and this is something I do extremely selfishly I am going to be selfish once again here so what advice do you have for me I believe that you have an idea of what I do so spiritual speaking or I am all am talking to you asGuru in my life what would you tell me at this stage of your smile you have a good smile a good sense positivity in you keep the positivity meditate Vice City don't miss your meditation and continue doing good work and more good work is going to happen to you in the future and so be prepared for that is it wrong for mebig material goals as well what happens to you thank you thank you just talking to you was a huge moment in my whole life and career genuinely really appreciated sir and I hope that through the medium we have created your voice is able to reach out to even more people than it already has thank youit happens to you you be ready for thank you Gurudev thank you this meant a lot so just talking to you was a huge moment in my whole life and career genuinely really appreciated sir and I hope that through the medium we have created your voice is able to reach out to even more people than it already has thank you

we have feelings like I dreamt about this and it's happening to me right now when we have those feelings of having met this person before all of that and so much more is possibly just computer program driving the entire world we are sleeping Somewhere But we're dreaming and the dream is perpetual and it's so real thatthink that the dream is the reality MS Ankur warikoo how are you sir when it comes to the world of starter of the guys wanna be you the girls Wanna Be With Youit's like the looks like the words the way that you can start at me and brought me in Mansa site no pressure at all what's what you are story I I mean a lot of people probably know and I just want you run the audiences through it either way it's fascinating life Ranveer I am so so lucky and privileged to have this life I have to be to be honest if you ask me when I was 20 would I be doing thisVadivelu I am the answer would be a conclusive no I was I was preparing for my life to become a space scientist I was working towards become an academic and went to the US figure out very quickly it wasn't for me dropped everything came back to India had to start my life all over again at the age of 24 by which most of my peers from school and college were already gone to do multiple great things in their life demand for a business schoolit Consulting and 11 years back became an entrepreneur that that completely changed the course of my life in them here I am what did you not like about America why did you choose the come back I actually loved the US I really liked my time there I didn't like what I was doing but I loved where I was I just couldn't find a milkround between what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be I speak often about thisthe US is a fantastic way to uncover your own self because his for the US does it offers you all the possible distraction the world has to offer literally everything you have your money you have your entertainment you have gaming you have food you have Pawn you literally everything that you want at your disposal and then it asks you are you able to navigate through all the distraction and still make it for yourself and a love that about the US and I love that aboutthe meritocracy of a how it it organises itself but I was unhappy doing what I was doing and I was the big reason why I came back what I read about your past is that you grow up wanting to join NASA and working as I don't know I don't know the term for it a rocket scientist space engineer I don't make a sound cool but basically want to work in the realms of space so did you like not try that did you not enjoy that after trylike what happened why didn't I didn't enjoy it after trying so I decided I pursue it for really long extent I was actually doing my PhD when I was in the US and the two years into it I just realised it was something that I was good at but it wasn't something that made me happy and that's why I keep your PhD in what in in hold on to your chair in Astrophysicsnice can you can you can you take us through Amin without taking us into the depths of that subject what's that subject about what you learn why did you choose to do PhD in astrophysics there is there is there is a stream call astronomy which most of us know of its basically looking at the stars and figuring out through the light that they admit and the visual mapping the daywhat are the all about astrophysics on the other hand doesn't look at them necessary but looks at their motion through it the Physics of state and prove that Physics it concludes pretty much the same thing that you would perhaps conclude if you were to look at it through a telescope it's it's just another stream of looking into the night sky and figuring out what I do we belong in and what we have to so I did the next obvious question thatin the mind of a lot of a young college listeners is a mystery could you believe in aliens like do you think that there is a extraterrestrial life of the absolutely yes hundred percent I have grown up on X Files I was the only show that matter to me I used to look at it delete this was back when they were no binging happening right so you literally had to wait everyepisode to come by and I started so much about alien life about extraterrestrial about all the conspiracy theories whether we have landed on the moon or not what happened in Roswell in 1947 have aliens visited the US have visited India O my God I am stories in stories about it right I do believe in the same I thinkyouth chunk of my childhood right from the time I think I discovered reading and around the age of 10 till say about 17 when the world kind of tells you know on science and engineering college that lyrics junk was all about the Orchid and studying aliens in studying about things like the Roosevelt incident kind of mosfet question have you had any like alien Encounters or have you ever felt like you got abducted yourselfPyar Hi I think I saw 3 UFO when I was in college and pretty convinced I did but the closet that have come to study a lot of Ameen again this is just a subject of interest for me so I think honour Instagram live stream I told you about these books by this guy called Graham and he he henative history Gai so he tries to prove that all the history with taught in school isn't true and that a lot more to discover like how I think one of the early history lesson that I had in school was about the four civilizations Chinese Mesopotamian education and ancient Indian but Graham Hancock strongly believe that there was a whole bunch of civilizations before that like right from around 50,000 BC 60000 BC around andwe had a lot of contact with the so-called aliens and that it is time to discover and what happened is 10 Ice Age kicked in about 11000 to 1000 years ago a lot of the land mass that we know today was actually waymo inland and was a lot more the course all over the world the Ice Age kind of took over all those landmarks of the stories were Dwarka and Atlantis and all these places which got submerged but there's a lot of talks about howIndians in humans would interact in that face of human history and any kind of hi as well as all of the yoga the red speak very positively about alien culture extraterrestrial cultural after know what you think about all this was your input on this old ancient human alien interaction with its it's the same thing can be that we spoke about the other day I I firmly believe that we're not thefirst human Civilization to have lived on Earth where with possibly the II and III or maybe even higher than that Civilization and I remember this book that really fascinated me when I was young I was called The Chariots of the Gods and this book was all about the fact that everything that we have come to believe as a as a remnant of ancient civilization whether it's the pyramids whether it's the Iron PillarDelhi weather is Mayan Civilization and all that they've accomplished all of that only happened because we were visited by extraterrestrial Intelligence and they were the ones who give us all the superpower and all the know how that we needed to get that the under way that he spoke about it was quite fascinating thing about it is if you would go to a really backward tribe todayMini forest tribe deep in Madhya Pradesh Andaman available and you carry with you your iPad and you carry with you your phone and you carry with you an Internet connection and you carry with you weapons all of them will look like literally God like just as we think God's word as we detect themimagine them looking at what helicopter is or what a parachute is or what just simple car is and they would be his mind blowing snow in their own Limited primitive mine they would start drawing us out and saying oh my god loudspeaker was like Shiv Vani and then an iPad happened and that was like God's tablet of Ten Commandments and not be in blast furnace here but you get the drift and thatis what happened that's exactly what happened what's your what's your opinion on the modern world with respect to extraterrestrial life do you think that area 51 is finally when announced that even have been visiting us for a while I don't know when I really don't know I in over here here is what I genuinely think I think that is the higher probability Ranveer that we are all living in a simulation then the fact that alien the weatherright now explain this further I like this if the movie I genuinely believe that we are in a matrix I genuinely believe that when we think of when we have feelings of deja vu when we have feelings like have I dreamt about this and it's happening to me right now when we have those feelingsI met this person before like this person sound the looks of Himalaya when we have this feeling like oh my god this is such a small world how do you even know that how we when connected all of that and so much more is possibly just computer program driving the entire world we are sleeping Somewhere But we're dreaming and the dream is perpetual and it's so realwe think that the dream is the reality which happens to us right when we can we wake up the so many times when we like am I awake Am I Dreaming is this really is not and it's quite likely that is that that's what happening right now I Hamen lagta hai ki Hamari destiny hai aur Hamara Karma hai aur Hamare yah sab hai but it will be quite a slap on all our faces if you already know is it is justprogram somewhere running in making it happen so again this is a big reason I kind of took a deep dive into spirituality like 45 years ago Biya spiritually the correct spiritual books talk about all these concepts were very yoga kind of Dharmik perspective I am not talking about the women's you read about in like Mahabharat Ramayan explain the nature of life in the ways so that the chapter in the book called the autobiographyYogi is kind of the later in the book is just about the Astral world and the whole experience of reading that book after that chapter is like it's very kind of spiritual is very kind of feel good book it it kind of strengthen your faith in God and positivity and they throw in the 1 chapter which is like it blast you out of your chair where he explains the Astral world in detail Have you read this book I I read the book but I don't recall thisukulele having paid attention to it so basically he talks about he explains the Astral world in detail in Chapter 41 42 the chapel god my Guru returns of something basically he is the protagonist Guru has passed away and he comes back to explain his soul comes back to explain the meaning and the nature of the Astral world so he talks about some very again for lack of a better word Trippy concepts in terms ofhe explains why the human experience exists in the first place and it's basically it's to test the free will of all souls day for what is a soul and egos and explaining that imagine that there's a massive ball of light which you refer to as god all higher power Awantipora something that omnipresent that that ball of light that encapsulates everything including health including heaven all that now imagine that ball of light ishuman beings brain ok and you take one tiny cell from the brain and place it on your palm so that cell is equivalent of one person's soul soul r&b soul with that one cell at which is a kind of tied Together by being a part of that same ball of light now on the journey from the brain to the Palm of that God's hand there is something called7 planes and in each plane Noida I don't know what the what the explanation of a plane is I don't know whether it is an actual physical plane I don't know whether it's something beyond human perception but on each plane you kind of leave a part of yourself and you reach the lowest plane which is the Earth clean the lower Plains and this is well prepared and one of the middle place so the lower place would be what we refer to as hell a hellish planets hellish realms button eventleaf parts of yourself the highest 7 realms and that there are seven chakras because each of them my aur Antennas to connect to light your higher 7 planes and basically as you spiritually advanced to get reconnected again with those parts of yourself that you left in those planes therefore concepts like deja vu or concepts like this larger than life things where you feel that something something is often you'll have to ask yourself why am I within this capsule callhuman body is actually all your 7 versions of yourself which are like kind of getting confused in question detail of time the people you back to the memory of where you came from and that's why in the human experience is spiritual purpose is like important because you're going back to your natural self which is not that one cell is actually that ball of light and when you do it's a ball of light is called Mukt the enlightenment whatever but people think it ends there it's not as simple as that in the chapterG talks about once you reach mukthiyum this plane you go to a much higher plane call the Astral plane in the Astral plane is the so-called world of Dreams where is basically you know how how to dreams work when you lucid dream mean if you think ok I want a burger in my hand and be able to have Sunday anything you wish I want to fly now you'll end up like they are still would work just like that way anything you can think of him physically be felt and that's the challenge of the earthso seductive that people get stuck there were even in the assel world there is a certain revolution that is supposed to go through with the gain of very spiritual process in that would and then you move into something called the causal world which is a higher version of the Astral world where there aren't all these distractions it's it's pure peace and the causal world the only way you can explain it another human being is not something you really tired and you sleep just close your eyes and then when you open it just like 9 hours agolike you don't know where was 9 hours of gone so that's why you enter the causal state of being where you can't you lose a sense of Identity you lose a sense of experience and you just wake up back and the human experience and even after the cause was there is the final the actual ball of light which are supposed to connect with once again this is a very rough acceleration of this done on a podcast what is like a lot of books about this book reviewgeography of a yogi and this book called 2 ways to light and general knowledge of the Rishi's these are the three books I've taken the third one is a series of 14 books which you can I order of Amazon very heavy stuff but incredible if you wanna take a deep dive uncle back to you you you you inspired me to read this book again man I I lost so much of touch from from all the things that you said and just as you would say it and it just felt this way motionit's time for me to go back to the book and I think that take away from this from this podcast Nation but I do think that some where it was that its spiritual question inside use a kid with made you think that you want to join NASA and become an a NASA engineer during this spiritual questions that cause something changed inside you I do know that I used to ask and this is my mum speaking not me but my mum does say that you usevery weird questions when you question like kya fayda ye sab karne ka kya hoga Bade ok kya fayda hai Naukari karne ka and that was just infatuation with something that all kids want togood work themselves like an astronaut or a scientist in work in a space agency in NASA was so cool it is back then when I was growing up but I over the years I think lately is when I have begin to question a lot about what do I want to do what does peace and happiness mean to me is it is it really chasing what the world Lays out asdefinition of success is not doing those things really failure and having a reflection on that has made me a lot more contemplated by a lot more aware about what drives me what makes me happy what was just bring me joy and the biggest thing that happened Ranveer and I have become Hindi mein quoteMamta so that is what I have actually started experiencing which is which is the balance you are you and neither overly happy when something nice happens to you you neither overly sad when something bad happens to you you are most like Naam but that support description because now almost just like you not living you actually living and nonliving meaningfully but you are not allowing your emotions to get the better of youwhich are like it was a life I think one of the most impactful Threads I read on Twitter was I told you say live stream is well it was something you wrote as my lessons up till the age of 39 and return a similar one about my lesson that 26 and mine was primarily about coming down angst and your working hard and then at 39010 hard work principles are established once those less angstestablishes very interesting to see how does a 39 year old human think and you had all these like concepts about leadership I think you had one of our family life as well I just I want to ask you that would like once you go towards the age of 40 what happens within your head like I am not getting Bankar I am talking about everyone you know human beings but what happens near 40 like do some people feel pressure do some people feelocean of not me let's do some people are want to go even harder in the pain because of things established what happens I think the overwhelming feeling Ranveer is that of where did this time suddenly go Mein 20 Ka Tha Main Bhi college mein tha I can literally just graduated right now and where the of these 20 years asali gowhat can I do and and that to a fair degree of people brings in a lot of unhappiness a lot of dissatisfaction and a lot of this general discontentment about what all they've got done in life and I like shit I will working so hard but for what and I still haven't gotten anywhere and I still am clueless and the number of people because I of course have a circle which is mostly for 3 year olds it is not it is not fundefinitely not something which which makes me feel happy the number of people who still don't know what they want from life and it still trying to find out there like I don't know why I am doing the job and doing it because it gets me money and it's like this regular affair of a monthly salary and of appraisals and of bonuses and promotions and all that but I really don't know if I would pause and ask myself why am I dokya ho raha hai what is the what is the driver does it bring me joy does it had any meaning to my life now and then the over then the other will be feeling as if you do have or don't have relationships then the appreciation of a if you have one then you appreciate what you have whether it's a family with the fact that your parents still with you but is the fact that you aapke than using them grow or the fact that you don't whether youin broken relationships in toxic relationships not in a relationship but all have lost your partner or have lost your family then the share realisation that at this age and going so forward that's the only thing that matters which will Centre you back to you what life's purpose or at least I could be I think itswings between these two extremes is have I done anything professionally and personally have a really stood up to what I wanted to do and then this other extreme which is I love what I have in terms of relationships or MS Word I don't have in terms of relationships do when I look at you I feel like a someone who gained a lot of Zener lot of peace so what have you done different as a 40 years old when compared to other like for 3 year olds around you I feelthe biggest thing that drives me and perhaps my thoughts Ranbir is this deep sense of curiosity I am I describe myself I am I am someone who loves questions but don't love answers and and database that I describe myself I love asking question that I love asking why how what when weather ifbut it like this dog chasing a car I am a dog chasing a car and have no plan what to do the car stops and just changing that is what happens when you replace the car with question and just changing that question and a love a lot like wide why did Ranbir asking this question what is it that that Ranveer has done that makes us stand apart from anyone else his age why did shebehave in that way why did I lose my temper that that day why did I feel insecure that one of time I constantly keep asking myself that and I think this is just a reflection of it has made me rich around about what I think how I operate and then I see most of the pattern the same I am not different then when anyone else can I think While We're given this drug that we are all different but he calledin what can come out of us but we are very same in terms of how we react and how we feel that is what has been big learning that whatever you say that I am going through it's quite likely that anyone else in the same situation will go to the same thing so if I can in some way create that awareness amongst my cell within myself and amongst others then is it makes for a much easier much easier stay on Earth if you willShukriya City Walk again from my answer was curiosity Quiznos voids and I will everybody has certain voids in the life on it might be our can I kill it in my career related becomes the relationships that it becomes existentialism but curiosity kind of feel that void of existentialism that's the question I've had a lot my head again asking out of curiosity to something as Prateek kuhad is well who is 30 years old and I don't know why I have been getting thoughts about fatherlike I don't know whether and how they go like certain women at in the late twenties will gets a strong thought Madhav Death was a biological phenomenon that is also applied to guys like do guys also gets faster like that like here I need to raise a family I don't know so my next of this question to you is about the nature of life after you've had kids like what in a kids journey changes you as a mantraffic question man I will tell you the truth and this is something I don't think I've shared publicly about the most gratifying thing and I'd say the thing that I will be most proud of on my deathbed which is just the fact that I got to experience father and here is why it so happened that around the time and weather who's whoelders and his nine years old he was born which was 2011 I saw lot of individuals who were shaped up as a doubts and the experiences and the emotions that they felt as a girls because of what happened to them as kids because of how their relationship to the parents work because about their parents were as individuals and it dawned on me thattwo boys and outcome of how my parents brought me up in a very meaningful manner and I don't think I'd reflect upon that as much as I did when when that happened anniversary wishes by chance and then there was insane sense of responsibility or most to the extent of being acting as pressure which is shit I am bringing this life on to earth and whateverI operate as like as an individual and how we along with my army along with my wife operator experience is going to shift the find someone's life at Puri Jindagi it it got me it got me thinking about so many things how should we know should we shout at him should we scold him at all should be given all the freedom that he wants should be allowed him to do whatever it is should be on school him should we Schoolshould be send them to a CBSE board or an International School what kind of kids will grow around Jonathan and soft water and soft water and it was the he was quite overwhelming but then the reason I call father had as a such a blessing in and such a privilege and because I realised there are very few principles that you need to take care of Beyond which if you as an individual are not stuck up onyour kids are raised you will actually go on to raise wonderful human be send and that's what matters and an and there is like if I want to show you with this room he has a rahe the wall which is painted with blackboard paint sir convert into a black border ki sabse upar Britain the three values that we want him to always stand by which is respect for everyone a very high sense ofresponsibility and zero tolerance for mediocrity and I think that's it it's just a few respect everyone irrespective of how this week who they are with come from and so on and so forth if he always accept responsibility and he has zero or very low tolerance for mediocrity We Started he started and doesn't need to be anything else and then thecompletely changed in 2017 when a daughter was born that was like my God admittedly I didn't want a second child my wife was like no other needs a sibling with only disabling it means alot and she comes from a family of three siblings I have a sister was six years younger to me they never really had a sibling sibling relationship is more like a elderly Guardian of search wish you right now we need to have a sibling relationship and a leg appsuch a angel and I can't afford to boys in my life to the likelihood that we will get a girl who is just is god is like 25% of the stats kam kar raha tha I can't play a gamble on those odds it's not work but thankfully she was a girl and she was such a blessing because then having a daughter Ranveer is when I think you experience to fatherhood filmenboy then is like a friend Girl Next completely something else that like you usually have to be a provider of protector + at the same time in still another the essence of equality the essence of equal opportunity and it's such a wonderful balance to find an entry for and daughter just are her wonderful it is wonderful I get what you are saying I mean this isalways thought about what would you feel like having a lot but when you articulated it like that I get it man like it and I don't exactly get it but I get away going with the whole protection as pack you feel a certain sense of humour girl anything how do I get that completely tough question is my friends while back is it true that raising kids in India Today is really expensive like is it like a big financialit can be if your effort you strive for is is quite hai to give us and Iraq go to war with at least right now is much too young will goes to an international school and it is expensive it is expensive it's his Annual fees is is more than what 30% of people in my startup andyesterday's areas but again I decided we very problem so I should be I should be complaining but it is expensive us does it take after you had kids ok forget forget that whole boy is my friend girl is my my responsibility but after you've had kids do you get a as a man to get a certain sense of ok now go to work even herwhat do you get motivation like what happens inside you like what does that they say that every age that you experience in your life A remnant of the day is always alive with the new CEO and 8 year old uncle would still be alive inside of $40 Ankur so that 25 year old you know who is all about career and hassle and growth what is that guy doing inside you now after you had kids it's funny to ask this question is such a terrific question again and I have gone on the earthside I am someone who is so comfortable with losing everything that we have including my identity that I would love your kids to also experience it in 2016 we went to a really bad face because we do with be raised money and a lot of money for a nearby which is a Startup that I found in 2015 I made some really bad calls very bad financial decisionvery very quickly ran out of money Weaver fundraising and was really hard so we had to be had to cut down on our on a salaries I had to take and my found this is why we have to take cuts we were we were not making is much money is it was just a really hard time and during that time we were what I would call a classic quintessential urban poor family where we had a house to live in a cardif we literally had no money in the bank will literally had no money in your bag and I distinctly remember it was without birthday and for the longest time he kept seeing a motorcycle I want to cycle and he was he was ready to cycle then we wanted to but believe it or not we didn't have even have money to buy him a cycle do we actually had to sell my wife's jewellery To buy himand reflect upon that I feel really happy about it because I'm glad that they went through the experience with the CEO and we also experience it ourselves that this is where we could get to and get be happy together and it really doesn't matter anything that hear what about that that realisation you don't need a lot to be happy in life we just keep buying shirtsbecause of our status and because what you think the world will perceive of us but with my kids the approach of visas we came from nothing and if we have to go back to nothing that perfectly fine and you will still get to be great individuals you'll still get wonderful parenting you'll still get all the love and the care and the comfort that we can provide and whatever means we havekya hua if you don't go to an international school kya hua if you don't travelling in a fancy card we love that and I think we very different in that sense because we we love them playing in that we love them just getting themselves drenched in the rain will love them going on their own to buy bread and under and answer on the role with that 9 he literally goes and does grocery shoppinglove that about him a lot about the fact that he can literally cycle is way through and go to the to the sabjiwala and and get Aadha kilo Nimbu because we wanted and so is connected and I love that because that's how we grew up that how divers are bringing and in some said and efficient way we can still give him glimpses of that we find that as a good thing so quiet on the contrary instead of working hard and like let's enjoy places enjoy this DiwaliKitna Kitna so smart I don't know when when you left home I left home when I was 22 I am convinced that way that will leave home when he's like what 1500 means we have likely five or six years more within Uske bad Gaya I get done he has his life and he is not going to come back in the way that he is today have a nice happy time with him with a woman what do you think of2030 for you personally like considering the fact that your experience in the starter would you know whether the business is going to kind of NID you are I know speaking to you read the lot I know you only read about this concert at the same time you are aware of like what happening now on touch with people like Tanmay myself using social media watch your calculation for the next 10 years of your life I really don't know and the best thing is I don't care ok I amdon't know I do when I came back from the US and I was in 2004 long time back I was I was heartbroken is almost felt like a break up because I was in love with Physics and I thought that I will I will go on to date physics and then we get married and then will be like in love forever and ever and it didn't turn out that way I like a finite kya hua like I completed my Salai 8 years into this is just like this and boyorder broken relationship as like no more goals and 9 more targets and life and that's how I have actually had on hard been living life ever since Ranveer I I commit myself to habits but not to goals not to target so I know what I want to do every day and I know that I want to I want to read every day I want to write everyday I want to create everyday I want to speak to people and I spent time with smart people every daybut where does it take me I don't know and I couldn't care less what I know is that this approach has helped me in good faith to metpally where I did for the longest X things clinically and a discipline fashion and there is compounded in such a way that it left me amazed at the opportunities that god created and a fairly certain that that will be the case in in 2013 as well but I don't know what that I will be a naive I set zero expectationsfrom that either I expect a lot for myself in terms of what I need to do but not what comes out of it and that's where your whole piece why was coming from that Aisa that you kind of you have this Vibe of exuding leg piece the coming very internal place in saying that I know a lot of 50 year olds and enough for that matter even 16 year olds who don't have that Vibe of Pisa probably have a certain amount of regret I see a lot of 50 year old factory Discoverylot of kids on these kids we talked to of beerbiceps to watch our videos who want to become entrepreneurs always the parents were telling them too kind of play at the old school wait you know like played safe not take risk because at the time they grew up and they probably had bad experiences starting the journey Somani relatives of mine told me that was movable or immovable is the best thing ever doing for myself what's what's theof life at 50 or 60 during its full of regret for a lot of people I know that makes you can't like generalize the what you think I think it's it will regret for a lot of people man it's a great for a lot of people and and that sucks it it it unfortunately sucks because I think regret is the is the worst way to enjoy your life possibly the worst way to endureanything fortunate that so many so many wonderful e LED lives do end up in regret because this is like what if what if what if so if I would have together with the most most people in the 56 30 I just full of regret that we didn't take the risk of probably listening to that conscience summary of which was telling the No 2 may be do this different circumstancesthat's a lot of people will rationalize it saying I did the right thing for my family at the right thing for the situation that it is and that would be largely through that would be largely through but it doesn't take away from the fact that they they never did anything for themselves if it's advised that the tragedy of life is not death the tragedy of life is what dies within while you are a lifethoughtful and deeper the same time wow that some intense statement but a Menu I see this all around me man like which is why I honestly I think I think when we are bhai sahab since it started working initially was owned was a lot of that solve it is a rider WWE wrestler kind of showing my time with you very soon realises no no no no no that's not how this game of this world worksand over the years that can be implanted down where I will reach the state of zero celebration because they are really lofty goals are set for myself and I don't want to Baug myself down with celebration all sometime the practice stoicism which is what you spoke about that not being bothered by the highs of the lows that's my current answer for how to live out life but what about what about people in the 70s and 80s and I'll tell you my version ofwhat I observe I have a 19 year old branded who stays with me and I talked to him sometimes about just his version of spirituality and he talks about how the last five years his health has like plummeted but his sense of spirituality is increased tremendously a God fearing dude but it it kind of this for Wave amplified so his reach to zone in his life he doesn't even talked much like this not too many wordschange the people I can barely hear but then once in a while when I have conversations with my asking what goes on your head light through the day what do you think of and he's like man you know I I literally just think of God and a Chand like a little bit and as I did you always Chandi Sandhu I don't know just started happening like maybe some childhood memories that like awake and he still shop in the head is census answer but is extremely sharp and that should just got me thinking about the nature of life and now around thethey had this conversation with him because I am into the whole meditation yoga school of thought we focus on a lot on doing this full day fast so ke like why you don't you basically just do a water fast and is no food that go inside your body for 36 hours so what happens is like towards the end of that day 8 p.m. 9 p.m. on that day you you definitely feel a drop in your senses like the power in your centre so you can't hear as wellyou don't have the energy to speak your eyesight is also not as good as like it is a normal circumstances you do feel this blunting of the senses so could you call that a simulation of old age maybe you know like it mathematically speaking when you quantified was happening its kind of old people feel like where everything comes more in word also the other big kind of change that happened in the school day passes that you meditation can go away Deepa because thefor meditation to go deeper is that you need focus within your meditation session we don't tell the beginner meditators within one America but if you been married for while it's a game of focus on your focus is tremendous in those meditations because all of your body's energy is not going to digestion not going into anything like outward not going in your senses all like inverter so it just got me thinking that I think the way the human body is developed naturally when your older your mentkind of naturally transition into things like Dhyan things like meditation things like in world focus Reminiscing about your live Reminiscing about the nature of life feel that 58 bracket to about 70 may be filled with regret mostly may be filled with your I could have done this and other 7 to restart blunting out and you kind of tone in words but what do you think of this like do I know that I have any experience but from what what you laid outI would be very surprised if that's not the case you so true hero absolutely true because you know when when there are these bhajankirtan always old people at those and they also were the kind of problem make fun of their version of old people think that your shoulder and keep them but they must be something that they discover that they like ok that's that's why I want to be now I mean that their version of good conversations like this I think anywheremy version of what do you think of high poll dates fruit like why does life force human beings to like deteriorate like that other than the spiritual aspect of things it's something that I would say active think about with something that I have been a very different reason speaking to a lot of young people and telling them especially the ones were like below 20 I tell themquite likely that none of you are ever going to die yeah it's it's quite quite likely that scientifically will be enough progress made that you're not going to die naturally you make it short or hit by bus or anything other than that because that but natural you're not going to delete my point when I say that is everything that you have come to know about how to live life is doeswrong every principle that you know how to live life is wrong with being taught 1 career 1 goal 1 marriage to kids one this month that all of that is gone it got you have to prepare yourself for multiple Carriers have to prepare yourself for multiple relationships you are to prepare yourself for multiple times reinventing your own self and none of you are prepared for thatno fault of your house but just the fact that the system is not set you up for that I feel that growing old is going to get out and becoming a lifelong student is going to come in and it's just maybe the irrational optimistic me that believes everything that sets us back biologically will somehowconquered what what will not be conquered is whatever success back emotionally and mentally because that is not something which goes back to the exact same description that you give light of the seven levels and if we know like no no med is going to get us to that it has to be something that we do with them we can we can inject ourselves with it and still get back are a physical attributes but what goes on hereis a completely different animal so I will be interesting here will be interesting the next the next 30 50 years for this world I feel very very interesting that that are very stimulating thought of life multiple jobs that gives everybody the potential to be a multi-millionaire you know if that how you look at life I want to ask is specifically about marriage in relation to again because you are happily married person how long we were married for No 17 years 13why do we be known each other for for now 21 years we got we got married after 7 years and have been married for 13 years nice so in a 21 your journey what happens to a relationship dudh and why are they so many couples who separate so here it is here is my head is my 2 cents on it I think separation is inevitable if the growth rates of the individualsis very different it is bound to happen it is bound to episode and that only happens all the time right with Agar if you understand the concept of compounding let's say I grow at 5% every year and my wife grows at 10% every year and we both start with round about hundred for the first three years you won't feel much of a difference right because I am in the first year become 10then I become slightly more than because I am about 117 hour battery and third year she is that about hundred 24 25 at the end of the area but come 5 years come 7 years the difference become stuck I usually start seeing a diverging path Jahan I am growing like this but she is doing like this weather is professionally whether it personally whether it anything elseand I just feel that that's recipe for for just the inevitable a lot of relationships should be about ensuring that you are able to pull up the lower of the slower growth rate person to closer to where the higher growth rate personal and becomes like the responsibility it's it's like the the slowest one will place the entire crowdwhy is very important for you to if you want to increase the speed of the crowd you don't increase everyone speed uses increase the speed of the slowest one and you automatically seen increase I feel that relationships are like that the and that's why if the is the husband's working and wife is not it becomes a very clear thing because the husband is getting exposed to a lot more is clearly glowing a lot moreI physician fortunately stuck in whatever and there is not enough growth coming in or if the wife and husband used to work but after kids the white stopped working but the husband continued to the Stanley after that there is this dividend growth rate that comes in the enough enough in most situations that lead to that but I think the the biggest thing for me is a difference in the growth rate of individuals results inrelationship can help cover the children aspect of it the wife aspect of it what happens to the relationship after the kids are born like does it drift do they come close together What happens is different for everyone here I I think that's the that's the hardest part because if suddenly the onus here is the hell is the absolute fact the kid or the child needsother more than the father for at least the first two years and that means by design and biological design the modem will be a lot easier than that that is a slippery slope because if the father is not participated during that time they could very well feel like the the white that they had has now just been reduced to a mother and then have a yanymore they could feel like there is no Spark anymore there is no time anymore there is no appreciation of the conversation anymore and that's why I feel that fathers bear a far greater Responsibility in the first two years of the child towards the relationship then mothers because mothers full almost full responsibility is towards just wearing the child inattending to it what is the beauty of marriage like after being married for so long that I hear a lot of guys don't don't get some positive aspect to what is the positive for me I can only speak for myself in the positive aspect is that my my best friend is my wife and I we we have the same taste we have the same worldview we like doing the same thingswe will discuss the same things are at stand on on on money on religion on parenting on how to live life is pretty much the same to which must visit have a lot of fun together we just generally have a lot of fun together and its brilliant company it is independent because she has her life and I have mine but at the same time it's participated as we are parents to wonderful kidsand it's wonderful companionship because it's friendship at the core of it which I think would really help us Ranbir was the fact that we got married after 7 years of dating and O7 nearly went through a lot I was in the US then I went to the business school should be of the seven years we will long distance for 3 years and we withthat should we knew that there was something in this that that could work in and work meaningfully but now obviously the next question about time travel because as the one thing we haven't covered Mr after astrophysics studies during the time travel will be possible at any point Mere science Mein mujhe bataya haithe laws of Physics state that the day The Time Machine gets made you start from there so you can't go back in time beyond the day The Time Machine started that's just the law of Physics that's at Einstein theory of relativity only hope in hell to go back to the dinosaur Era or to the previousis that someone had made the time machine already I am waiting on the fact that we are in a simulation and all of this is orchestrated at some point in time we will upload ourselves for saying every time machine banaa liye while it will just be a coder turning onto production one code of The Time Machine will give the fake illusion that we are who are the owners and conquertime is well now since this episode has turned out to be the nature of life that's what I think the topic would the datatype in the title would be the question is like out of all your studies is there any science fiction style discoveries that mankind is good make in NX 10 20 years which will change the way humans live other than the fact that you know what it called bio biohackingbiohacking where you can extend your life by none other than that is other things that happen in the next entry in the next 20 years there are in my opinion the likelihood of these three things happening we definitely going to meet intelligent life form outside of earth absolutely number to interplanetary travel and perhaps even settlementbecome reality and number 3 we will begin to have machines inside office for Virtually everything that we need whether it is protecting what we are suffering from or telling us when we should get up or telling us that this is the vitamin orprotein that is lacking in a diet today or telling us that the person in front view is Ranveer who runs a successful business and is a successful influencer without me when speaking all of those machines skills that I call it will be implanted in a kill it like Alexa Alexaexcuse so she can answer questions imagine and Alexa in here which is driven by our thoughts and other Liberty that beautiful and I also feel that the Heights in terms of their physical and human beings and all that but the real question is and what will be the big youchallenge and as of now I can only think think of likes a mental health and spiritual health and may be right for lack of a better word romantic health and that's going to be like the area of focus in terms of how do we improve these things but what do you think what do you think will be the next Big challenge no I totally agree with you here it is like if you if you go back to the 1970 and you saw someone running on the streets of New York you would stop them and askwhy are you running and they like and running for my health analyser you crazy I could tell that to the same thing is happening right now with meditation we will I know is a safe at yaar bahut Mushkil are you don't do it in that about meditation is going to become mainstream just as running is today is playing a sport is today will become a life form it will be something that we brush our teeth and we go for a run because we know it's important to be brush our teethwill meditate because we know it's important and that I feel at least I hope so but I didn't really feel that in the next 20 years mental health is this could become mainstream it's just going to become so normalised just the way physical fitness is today with people still choose whether to do it or not and they will know it's the right thing to do lekin tum bhi bahut Sare log Nahin Karenge but it won't be like oh my god this is what you doing are you crazy is like I wishsweet like that I wish I could have Therapy I wish I could be mentally at peace I wish I could meditate and and people will then just not located in the way that the located a few meditators I do I do everyday so how much of a link do you observe between your meditation and your mental health I think a large part of it yaar it's very hard to to find a direct link it because there is a so many other moving parts biting the fact that start my day whenHoli and start with meditation for at least 30 minutes it just it is centres me in very meaningful ways because I just realised that I I connect with myself in such a meaningful strong manner that very little during the day can then perturb me whether it's weather troll on social media whether it's a bad news whether it's anything that's not gone my waypieces and parcels of the same journey and end users who want a large part of my my composure comes from meditation for sure and black my final question of the whole podcast is why are you on social media like what is the intention because it obviously isn't like you know I wanna run this is started the young people take up to build out the digital branch but I see you doing it for other reasonswhat is the social media game you are playing a game Ranbir is with the intention of spreading awareness and here is what I mean by that I realise that a lot of people including myself when I was young we make choices in life from a point of ignorance and not awareness vmake visas in life not because we know every other choice and does we making this choice we make choices in life because we don't know any other choice and this iswe have that justice is it is unfortunate that in today's world so everything I speak about is obvious from the point of awareness did you know did you know did you know and it like you can speak about facts did you know or you could speak about how could you go about thinking and that's what it is I dealt in my most my content this forces people to think I don't have all the answersscooters I hate giving out prescriptions because who am I to give your prescriptions but I love to discuss how I thought about what I think about the same things and as many share it with them the hope in hell is that they also get some sort of a Framework for guiding force to to think about the same thing when they encounter them that the intention no outcome I don't know where this should take I don't know whether they are you switch off of the social media channel like that I amreminded of of just over that was the Tom Hanks movie that the one in which he changes his power of the world's greatest events and he doesn't even Forrest gump could I forget it's it's like It's the exact same thing in forest company started runningI he is not running any kids running and then there is a community that goes behind them and they also running nose why is running and everyone that I think different genders to it and one day one fine day he says stops it could very well be it could very well be higher picture myself that can offer that beautiful but I do feel that there's a lot to gain from you and I feel like the main kind of learningof an entire generation is going to happen through the internet Siberian Husky people in that way for the don't stopped from the start a podcast at some point I would like to keep keep your inspiration so I will pick you on that and definitely start right right back at you I have been studying a lot about you and there's actually a lot of things are gonna ask you offline of a camera but for now I am going to be linking your handles your page down below and Ankur anyshining of notes for the listeners no I I I always say one thing Ranveer and this is this my biggest and I just make sure that you don't live life on someone else's definition of success from your own definition of success and dust from your own definition of failure and if you are to do that deliver the best gift you can give yourself the beautiful thank you miss you for being on the way you are a pleasure thank you thank you for your thoughtful questionsyour pleasure thank you thank you for your thoughtful questions is always a joy to listen to you and end with win an incredible experience being part of a podcast thank you I'm glad your financial will be doing a lot more episode aliens Time Travel and other such topics but we will we do this again only"

study well in a then go to you was then in Urduthen get an organisation whatever traditional family that was working mother house wife had a very successful sister to your older than me when I connect a new and unfortunately for me and fortunately for her she was the better of the lot and I wasn't I was wanting to be doing things better than everyone else having a try too hard and feeling divided bybut the eleventh I feel Chemistry by first failure in life then I graduated 12th with very mediocre scores couldn't get any admission into college through the normal process of entrance exams and staff could get through any ranking and I have no idea why I chose to do engineering I think the pressure because my parents never force me on to anything super should parents want to study I force thempay and get admission into a college so I went to SRM Engineering College for today's SRM University so that was the start of failure but I can go on and talk about engineering failures as well you felt very low in Engineering College Bangalore weekend up feeling low what was even more than that is nothing about it now for engineering admission I took my mum to be done have money to pay for the capitation fee right inSahi took my mum to the bank and the mortgage for bangles for a middle class family will not superhit and all that Saqib joking know that my engineering my mother's bangles went to the bank now I feel bad that I had no idea did you think you become a CEO at that stage is no lucky one thought away I want to become a c p u no way I mean I I honestly thought that first Fursat I become singer because I was massively into music and stuffgenerally thought that I'm wasted and I knew that feeling sometimes when you really don't know what you're doing and staff engineering this many times I feel it's the years and I would like to forget except for the friends you do you did you spend extra used in college no ok I graduation for that only good thing that happened but 3rd semester fail 3 subject 4 semester failed 3 subjects at 5th semester I cleared and I still don't have any idea how I clearedbecause I don't think I did anything different whether the college was kind enough for I don't know whatever I wrote work your examiner was in a good moodjust to fill up the paper and passed in rose paper burnley but the right after Engineering College did you begin your career in the corporate world there any kind of intention or you just afraid you didn't know what will happen what was your mindset and 2222 was somebody who couldn't get any placements because I was allowed to sit on placement UK it isn't exactly because of my back some stuff and then my parents knew some people so I rememberI was recommended for some entrance exams in one of the engineering companies in based in Chennai I I went for that I didn't do well then I started trying on job that sales do to door sales in staff was very upset at home in I was the same time I was trying to go to US for further Engineering with funny that I mean I could do a bachelor degree properly but again the herd mentality that we all go through a 11 I didn't like in engineercollege bus how a lot of the kid who chose to go abroad would look down a lot on India and like go with that little angle of like I hate this country are leaving it and I'm going there are many satellites and always question that you don't like weight but do 22 useful life this country is given you your home Som SOM hi values a lot of them figured out life and coming back know it to his own those on something I Breathe I live I think you know when I will reflect now and I see people argue for example could you graduate what 4Anaconda things that people are you are doing isomorph feel I wish I can go back to my 20 year olds and relive those like because I didn't I don't know why I didn't know or I didn't go and search for it tries to remember when I was in school 11th I had to work in a music store heroes call music chewy and I worked in selling in also during summers for example but beyond that I didn't do anything different anddoes a very traditional kind of a you apply for jobs in and get it so after Engineering at 22 I thought my life is gone I still remember sitting with my best friend in his grandparents house in Chennai and I told him that I said your half is going to be gone we are actually not doing anything else this is after engineering and he said it's ok we will just be successful one and half years later and today it funny look back and stuff but you hadwhat is well in engineering so I'll tell you now for some reason my dad had a lot of Israeli doctor friends and I speak a lot of that it so in Israel the system is after the 12th standard they have to serve in the army for three years erect and then everyone every person who served in the army at the end of it is it compulsory 1 your vacation so they called on working holiday Visa and stuff and I don't know that butevery kid who's 21 by the time I think take that one your vacation and travel the world they travel within Israel and you live soul searching a lot of clarity about what they want to next order do something like tiny internship did you get an idea of things and then they do the architecture of medicine no engineering of Finance whatever they have forgotten media I feel that this in a country where because the battery system it support and a lot of pressure like your supposed to your career at $18 cannot choose which is too young forman to decide Shuddh was dating at that time she took your of I remember this and everybody was bad mouthing off what you doing with your own families that more thing she's doing the best for everyone in my bache now because she got her next figures in the media industry and she just took that one you're off to relax your mind to understand what to do and stepped into great zone and I will even I at that 22 age bracket I did a lot of odd jobs like and then work Mein uncle engineering factory addresslibras you know the about what their perspectives on life what is perspective of the guy at the top and just right drawing out the world map for myself worked as a fitness trainer is taught me a lot about money value in it taught me a lot about life amazing you are so very common in best country for the year of you find lot of backpackers coming to Australia from Europe and staff 1 year backpacking write the learn in the recently was talking to Ek League extender colleagues as well who is actually in Switzerland the Braziliantecnia Sabbatical and his kids are about earning 8 and 10 years old probably an acid what about them if they come with me school he said the schools at the best Education Centre beside her but it's very hard to explain that to Indian national give some perspective I have friends of mine Engineering College very good students according to the dream MBA college in MBA it did well got the dream MBA job after the madam your into that the company in the electron to be miserable so why you miscible 1:00 Bajemy job to because I assume that by working hard and getting to this job will be happy I'm not happy with everything to the tijuana 5 star effort in everything I've attempted and now and an unhappy place what does all my 5 the effort consistently mean like you hit a century like every match is played and you end up as like an happy so that what causes that little hollowness which is why exactly feel that more Indian students need to be told to take that onethe blessing of a country where we allowed to stay with her parents not that's not look down upon not take that one more your financial support from them if it's possible and just exam time of a soul searching for the rest of your life for the 90 years only but it's not just about taking out what I am what I will work is there should be no pressure to just keep going from one spot another we always do that right I think a lot of parents do that I don't thankfully I don't have that parents and it was unusual that90 is my parents essay it will do whatever you want it is not easy and not because they have any financial freedom and stuff you know your first it was purely that they wanted to let go whatever you want to do you do it like society works like this correct batting parents should if you want a car you are often do whatever whether it is asset fitness whatever he was just trying to figure out what they want to do and you do odd jobs in its fine it will figure out a tissue more than four years of EngineeringI think people speak much later you know what you mean when I mean by that his career and life takes off not at exactly the point of you finishing a degree and then things I know it worked for many people were saying no but I have even in my own school a lot of the guys who had been over the top rank students and staff then they did the typical you know why it of BITS Pilani and then went into I am saw usit's worked for them but many others with the backbenchers and staff have done equally well who had a lot of gaps and their lives and I have my own works only right now in fact he had to finish engineering in five and half of six years and is extremely well because no relationship between studies and what you doing life people don't know while the rainperspective of education so but again coming back to your so journey you really like and sprinted of the corporate ladder I want to know how that sprint happened and I know your humble person say you want to use in an advanced placement to study life but you want to the youngest be used in the country today so you done something that you've played some game right I want know about that game require It begin how are you understand the rules to do after 20 politics at any stage showwhat was that sorry so I joined centre in 2006 as a fresh bread in a management trainee in law is like a week and explain elevator company in a we are the world the world's largest elevator escalator moving box so you CS in airports in malls in commercial buildings in Sabari it's a family owned it listed company but family-owned still buy the single family in 5th generation for its winners since 1800 SBI been in the worldand so the very traditional engineering companies which company known for Precision quality premium brand kind of any kind of stuff side joint centre in Australia not in India because I was studying the and after I graduated study I did Masters in industrial engineering ok so thankful it was hard core engineering it was more Management related engineering studies I think that's probably where things started working out because if you have to engineering udokinda figured out and the whole living in Australia was also a great life changing experience living alone with no support for income and staff you know you could do everything yourself you changed one person in what does it do like when you when you kept away from family and your boyfriend for yourself what does it do Ho Gai especially for people from India it use like what happened I first two months I remember crying every day why am I here because you know I will end in Australia with the two thousand Dollarsthe money was given and the house rent 4000 dollars on my best friend he was still with me by the way Bala we both went to stay together we took our house so $2,000 for rent and $2000 was the advanced photos knowledge we have to pay so we just paid whatever we had and the empty house so the struggles and from there you going to walk into a house in India what happens if we move into house in apartment slightly furnished at least a new neighbours comevyaktiyon ki want coffee tea whatever is nothing we talk to you you don't look like them you are dark skin a lot of racism discussions always going on the street and held at sadli sadli yes but I don't blame them because I always remember that we are even worse in over 100 so whenever I've had some instances in a once I remember I want to buy pizza and I was calling my friend and asking them in Hindi 1 hour lekhan kya and the lady corrugated sheet flooring the10 dollar bill on my face and he said that you can Indian get off my shop that day I felt totally like paper waste paper lega tissue paper I felt again nothing I'm hollow and all that that only time I had this nice since then I've found it very well but what it teaches you living alone H I recommend to everyone you know don't have to go Overseas you go to live alone would no life you could have no value of money when I went to work in Indian restaurant washing dishes and a $100 that was the biggest money in my life in Miamispend spend I sent to all of my mum and dad offended meaning no money became very important every dollar I was counting in a good McDonald's $3 burger 200 rupees around it you feel like chalo I keep it for something else to be used by Cup noodles are the most we love the fried chips in the growth of Greek shops in Melbourne Melbourne is big bridge population is a second biggest repopulation out of Greecedo you get this corner shops like this a Kirana dukaan right you get like for $2 the whole bag of fried chips services by the four of us and we used to have that would now that's what you could offered and you don't want to spend more but we Indians known to keep money as well and also when we used to do on Jobs will always have money in the month where is the Oz for not have so much so please ask us for cigarettes and wine bottle wine and staff but so we were leaving 6 people into thehouse which is not uncommon in India and abroad and it is totally uncommon should people think that they gave a one bed in a bit like this right now we know we have fights about cooking Google Google clean who took my childhood ok my egg who took my whatever you know the business overflowing unit for a new start understanding living with people and understanding how do you managepeople skills used this display of more in your so than engineering absolutely a lot and all the bonding in Sabina internship from the college I had to call Yellow pages in a together pages and ice to call companies that I am looking for internship due have anything can be used to walk the streets and look for internship opportunities and staff the college provide some leaves but not enough and then from the delete you start getting other leavesso when I still remember the first internship added in a company called Berry juice the very famous Itna Bada by the sun but the beer company in Philippines Samuel use company in the world now they own Berry juice and I went for internship on a finished internship and I still remember the guy said what is this useless work that you've done an asterisk right in front of a horrible idea that but I was feeling so terrible that I could not you do internshipyou don't you go home to meet your friend and her family waiting for you 93 Gurgaon unko to have your duty as well because their roster one day you cook Tuesday you clean Wednesday if you put the bins and blah blah blah so it was but it was that every Street in Melbourne has a story for me another five the head with people they struggle to went through making that $1 Friday night I was to come back home at 2 o'clock in the light from work like after Indian restaurant was a common job is to do Raithe worst job because there is to abuse a lot of the stuff you come back home and watch these nightclubs people enjoying having fun and no other days I Just Wonder how will I have a day like this you like to live with their party and not here working are you feel now it's good but I am so you had those days as well write up basically when I started out my career like I had the strong rule of not taking anymy parents because I feel like that's the only in the value in the business of creating that when you really you should you take a loan but why did you do that I am is very easy read you have a successful family behind you I so I think very early on while I was in final of Engineering my dad told me that that if you want to do business school among help we will be because that's the actual MBA that you do before the business and I took it as your cool Main To Karunga Alpha One the access I do you know I realised if ittoday also understood is whatever skills that you have a gift you have if you focus in your free time in college on educating yourself that a pair of an outside of college in some way or the other in college I had done or fitness course like I'd gone very deep into fitness just for fun education didn't think it will lead to anyway my mum and actually you are you doing this and other than no no I don't know it's an interesting enjoy the subject once I needed to make money month ago from 10 200 rupeeswhat do you know what do you know you know fitness and you can talk well so I went up to people on Carter road and just started talking about fitness just told them that you know by the way I am doing the YouTube channel and making a few and communication skills plus fitness knowledge as we want to fitness doubt that I cleared for the night was born and died due to this exercise should do this one of those kids happened to be fair Richmond funcontact me on my Facebook page at that time anything here really loved your interaction with me so I was wondering if you can train me also I took my third class ticket in the train went from Dadar to Vile Parle thinking about ok our trained and even before what do I how do I do how do you know how to how much to charge for as my own coach to make oats ad what we give me your number 15 went there I just figured that ok let me try doing someKota the slightly higher number 10 rupees to a lot more than that I knew the product and giving them is that kind of money so there is nothing wrong in what I was doing without sharing very detailed and teaching I told in the tuition is not just a training session with you independent in 3 months I should be taken you these experiences that our generation now should start doing whatever is possible in the weathermusic teaching work is going and going and working in a shop in selling this great experience to weigh more than that padhaai you do for exam to get good marks to top in exam that's not going to be organised as much as the real world cup ad experience is the best job which give me the thappad was I work for Melbourne up everything right click event in event is a global companyjobs to clean events over Raigarh so I work for three weeks it was holiday and in summers in holidays we can work out how many hours you want us to the rule in student life was 20 hours a week is the maximum work and I was one of those students who never worked more than that while many did because I can do it can take cash in hand without declaring income to the government can do that every students about that parrot and I have to thank my best friend balahu this to put me in line in a whenever I was crossing the line I know we don't do thatthis should arrive at a beer bottles and the best paying jobs $20 or something like that and three weeks taking other people's drink beer bottles you know it was like it was a service and then you realise what can life teacher and that's why I always go back to those days will I still go to my house where I lived first in Australia whenever I go back for holidays in staff and go and see that this is what life has taught menot forget something like this I was story to add myself when I started out this whole YouTube thing and training at the same time and money was coming to the training and I was alone at my made how to record the video that pic hundred rupees session variable with out of focus and all that is my made just like any of you know it yet but it was it was it was a struggle for family of like four generations of doctors so for them I'm still amazed for for me to even doduring was a huge what the like doing so it was like little it is the difficulties and I'm getting my mum and dad consulate am you know you can't do this video thing for the rest of your life we can do YouTube is an organ workout Upar Se you don't have the money for equipment I was using my very old laptop at some of downloaded for free of cost editing software eating grow very slowly life was very difficult doing a lot uneditable so if you see old videos it achieved throughlike the law of motion and I felt that they would be like you have clients at like 7 in the morning then at 10 o'clock you are you begin your video work in the scripting then that work goes on to about 4 p.m. in 45 30 years to work out to maintain a body also and then I say about 6 p.m. I would catch Alaikum one train in rush hour traffic sinp car in Mumbai in Mumbai which is we push people hate peoplethe train and Angela hack for that was don't Raigarh in for 2nd class Govind 3rd class by the fisherman and all other is known as the travel of them so I had moment they have been trained and there is like a smell of fresh and when I go home with my parents shouting at me salve crying in live 3rd class in wipe my tears then go to my clients house in the evening in Andheri and then go to three years back to back sound Reliance to apply covid-19 gap in between and in what ways that one would go to Juhu Beachand run with the people running until the more I have a YouTube channel subscribe this making best use of my time come back at 1 a.m. my mum and dad would like them in and you doing the wrong thing in life after that hustling so hard this is going to write 3-4 months really hard and very tough as nails like then online hate dinner than I was doing something right real life hate when people ask me how to do online Hate StoryAnjali sleep at like 2 a.m. again like lot of time this is a proper depression feels just like for to get up at like 631 go back to the gym start Battle against this is this stuff which people don't people see YouTube numbers glamour this Chloride and they don't know what that bought here there what is important and that it was an easy it was very difficult to 1000speed of their first mover advantage that time so I don't look back at that and say that if the best face me that is really brought you here in the people on the don't know because I haven't seen it and utilising that one hour on the beach it's taught me the value of time even today if I am in office I N sure that everyone is on the same one hour and the Beast and that is the company culture that come to begin with one but now you know4555 people everyone has that utilise time really well even advana shouldn't get based on that benefit of the growth so company culture I feel happy begins in your struggles I am sure you look so that when your picking up will be awarded something you learn the Giving out your people at Chennai very true and know your question to me was the the rise in the organisation and that's where the seat was soon as and when I started working instant love actually remember I'mgetting a ticket to be flown to Sydney for the final interviews and this is a big thing because you don't have a dream of flying into an alien staff and getting through starting buckinghamshire love you are the early hacks I had was a nice as a lot of people when is an organisation you know you have to make sure that people know you even at the lowest and highest levels ok so usually you know your look you are group in your team or whatever but when I was working in the callquality engineer / management trainee I used to go to the management team on the basis of the company Right Of The Legacy of the business director the vertical directors and staff and tell them into water can help them out and stuff and many of them never took me seriously one of them date and because that's very conventional things to do in a young person especially if you are from another country you have a strong in an accident you don't look like the measure your number for master degreelook at you know very favourable way you know so I can say then I can help you answer Telugu this guy know what is he trying to help me out but you should do it because if you just said they had a computer all day keep working and do your job just be a part of this is the part of the crowd you can't be so I think I would if I had given one line the answer was I always want to stand out maybe because I didn't have success in my past I thought I was useless so I would start ki how do I stand how do I do thinknobody has ever thought of you know and now I called up scene success but that's why I think it starts with how do you do that extra incremental size is a lot of se young actors and actresses all Industries the one who really break out other one should take this slight risk in social situations where they will vary you know shamelessly go up the people and just start talking they make a fool of themselves many days 410 v i will meet someone who will respect them for doing example when I was workingwe had seven or eight Indians and we had lunch time I am so you know this right you have a habit of sitting together meeting where are the world we are Indians and many other Nations is not present in span is the same as well so the Europeans as well so everyday lunch time I'll go with my daba I had the bar and most people bring food in Australia as well from home and they had a habit of stealing together size go to the lunchroom and I'll go and fit the new table all the time or with morningso this makes fun of me the like are you trying to suck up to them what you can do it some like I said I want to know the something else I want to be with people that have not been before and understand the culture and stuff that helped alot in USA was utilising my accent get into various cultural sites to try different food they used to bring such a my food so somewhere I was building a Repo with the head office of the head office by the way it is going that of a few years I built a huge network of head office supportBros Pratima checked and I was in a quality Roadways auditing people and people bonuses will link to my work if I give them a bad rating they use to miss out on money and the year so I still remember there was a Gai call Harry who is the project manager extremely smart guy but his paperwork is a hands-on Gai so I used to know that he had this problem so one month before the audit I used to go on actually every prepare for him in the user feedback is the why you doing this message no I know thatdon't do like this and you do a great job and help me out after a couple of months he does are doing on ozone I know when I then became a branch manager were the first people to help me is that I want to succeed how can I help you become successful because when I first became a branch manager in 29 years old in Queensland Brisbane is a capital people would know Brisbane branch manager at that time I didn't have any experience of managing people or sale the not think ahead of his people helping me and that's what the heck I would tell people thatGoogle put yourself out there talk to people don't expect company will come and talk to you right because I know you think about it even your organisation you are the boss and you have the employees of Audi employees is it easy for you to talk to 40 people or is it easy for XL come talk to you right now I feel is easy for the 42 comment talk to me even the other way round even if right now we have 4000 amplifier in employee Central India I always tell them enough for you you onlyso 4500 please so when you were with people know Ranveer and Ranbir has something on let's say for example tomorrow Ranveer is not well and good podcast may be one of these people you think can I ask you do it right not people can say you are sucking of the boss you are advertising yourself marketing yourself but what is wrong I mean I don't have a marketing manager for myself as the companyRahul your marketing manager it yourself in Engineering college when they tell us your communication skills will take you for like this is what they mean it's not just in the board room in the dining hall it's in Europe between coffee break relationships that you build and without having any prejudice of my community is e my colour is male female is eagle's bane whatever you know the diversity things I remember when I came back to India after one year in Australiaand what my driver to open my door for the car and added one my main to wash my own plates something small that teaches you which we don't have here you know we are not taught that represent also just generally even have worked with a lot of people who aren't from India that's what means I'm connected to the most when you are able to talk to them as humans and not ok white person black person and Asian person not disconnect the morning human-level and work happens by itself and this is also thesweater men and women when they kind of treat the lady at home I want to you in hours but when you connect a friend or if it works much better close something I don't understand but again so once this started happening to you where things are working out your relationship started building that so bubble pop in your hand very quickly right so I was to yours an entry-level roll 2016 join Chanda 28 around mid of the year was offered the general manager role for Queensland and I took the role I was there for about three years and already again in a band of third year I was offered the Soviet Naam add one thing you because this not forget about it right now yes we spoke in relationship in communication skills but I am also show that you are very honest and very good with your work and other Indian engineers coming out so that I been that no doubt your communication skills is definitely important but you also be gonevideo craft and I'm sure you did that I think that is a basic on a sleeve everybody is has to be attractive to grow you can't have that is not one of the Other right you can do it political is a very political person you can be amazing with connections and is a gift of gab what gift of gab is a communication rocket ok if you are very good and communicating and blah blah and jugadu in a tight to talk through and make yourself look good it work for a short period of time with cricket batwith good enough results then of course your gone so that is being consistent thing for me that every time I've done it always the work comes first and then you bhakte with your network the connection connection with the staff that's important AVN there's no doubt about that which I think a lot of my peers and I've seen many many people much better in the craft than me but somewhere I think I've always been able to succeed is the network so the connections on the X Factorthink so it had to be really honest and look at internal myself that help me and I always tell people to do that that will really help them to take that one more step ahead of the game so what corporate politics is that thing all over the world that doesn't happen happens all the time and how do you do it as a corporate Riser being very very honest and I have to say early in my peace I would have made Mistakes of trying to be wanting to be seen in a click in a crowdin a group of groups and organisations and staff but very quickly realised that you could be very you could be not in any group is the biggest risk when you are termed with that person ok with that person is gone when you're gone as well so when you put your head down and you do your work well you coming kill everyone at the same level of same way the weather was talking to the Indians of the non Indian staff I treated all of them it was that important with politics is and in this oneelevate my role in India is a lease political organisation that I walked in I could believe in myself because I know we all think the India's Harley political Indian organisation theory political and you are slot of returning Indians what is the biggest fear they always say it politics India mein Kaise kam kar sakte hain Itna Mushkil Hai To bahut sari bahut hi real life Bigg Boss exactly but I have had the least political environment in Shimla India which I am very surprised as well happily surprised but it happensMalaysia that happened in Vietnam it happened Australia it happened every because I think official happens more if you are a very successful young Leader with people always think they have come he is getting ahead of everyone else what is the reason that we are not able to do anything just that he has built relationships just that I still get I'm sure it'll get told that they know that he knows everyone that's why he he gets things doneconversationalist that that goes with having the ability to create a listed as if you can hold conversation you ever go through what we learnt about Canadian Visa think knowing you you must have done some studies in becoming a better conversationalist I was added a little bit of training like presentation skills and staff but as a person I am very like I'm very curious so that definitely helped them always interested to know what is he doing what is she doingnow I am learning things about what I can do in my organisation from completely different industries write like come I have actually learnt from how you done podcast for example but I do not a podcast but have similar kind of engagement in my organisation inspired by what you have done for example in a similarly you know I have interacted with many cm Industries to get knowledge that you can then copy and paste what you doingfighting shamelessly copying is a very good thing we should not actually but what you should not use your own it should acknowledge that you know you took it from somebody so if you Vinoth very interesting questions to ask I want to share a very good example here when I was in my first role in Shimla there was a day when I had to enable access any outside office having a coffee and managing director he just came out in the car park with the coffee shop was looking around and he saw me his call me his sideyou have ka and had a second hand Volvo which I had bought you know with some savings and staff as a yes I do a nice Kempegowda airport and earlier we can go to have had so he jumped on the car and then I asked him how you can pick up please at the head of asia-pacific is coming my car is not in today so I thought I can ask you so I just started taking and he I still remember he said that the that time there is a perfect had currently the chairman by the way is aDenim to be an apology to my managing director said that when I when you pick them up and make sure he sits next to you that's your 15 minutes every 15 min tried every shot from the officers airport to the 15 minutes and you make the use of it the best way you say it that all is forgiven tell me what to do in stuff so that 40 minut happened fast forward five years I was given the opportunity for Vietnam as a Managing Director at that timeGlobal so know he was a director and I was told that he had to interview me for the role so I was told it and I didn't hear directed I was told that he said I know Ashok Gupta madam five years ago we can do the job I mean it was like wow so this is a very small example of how something you can do you can help you somewhere else in life I have this on our friend I usually keep bringing on the podcast he has this logic thatthere are two guys in a dark room if they both of us to throw darts at a dart board the guy who hit the dart board is the one who throws Mod arts out there and that those that can be anything in terms of you just put yourself out that Converse with people to talk to people for genuine is important which I know when I bend we might as well as a lot from you with that you know you're not trying to show what you are very genuinely interested in the person so when you do that I think people see through that very very easily Junoon wall can'twhat is adverb curiosity I have that but it also from a place of fear because I get my academic family has told me that we are missing out on a lot when not doing a post graduation to anyone and meet who is at a position I give us a sum and not for you know even of film actor I go into mode of curiosity about OK what could have learnt through his MBA that I can't tell me the conversation when I go into the way you so you are my MBA but a lot of my elder brother I made it sound meinbecome a part of my life now that curiosity education is outdated like anything I am just right now I am reading a book and it says that 70% of success comes from your skill when a person comes from networking and 10% comes from formal education and skill is not formal education necessary right arm around you went to college to learn how to do podcast how to YouTube having it what you are built overyou found your strong points and you worked on it and you built what you will now that's what I would tell people write that don't get upset about formal education even today in organisations in the people tell me the by introducing us to formal MBA courses for short term courses in Harvard or in IMC Instagram like dude I have never chase any formal training in my 13 years in Shimla because the exactly what you said you know curiosity you start learning and you start taking a visit implementing themsobin lot of people join organisations and they say you know that is no formal induction this no formal training so what did get on with life and you find your way no kicked it can also I want to just switch off modes a little bit you this was the story and because I need to outside of podcast also I know that you go for the CEO of meetings have theseNational CU meetings Anand Mahindra Ho Saiya rahele host other Topsy use what happened that those meetings exactly was a background on the meeting also like what's the purpose of it is it and networking event is it education what happened so basically I'm part of the Indian leadership Council which is run background x l c Soi TLC and fit membership that organisations can provide for CU and stuff and I want to be part of this for the same reason that you willMBA from other so right right so I was attending it last 67 months and one of the sessions curated was one was much screwvala Ronnie screwvala one was with Mr Anand Mahindra and Mahindra session stands out to me because it was amazing conversation again and we hear of so as being full of provado and Ego and submit it was a person extremely down to earth extremely humble so what really happens is there curate sessions for very closeclick of people 20 people that the people and you are having a private conversation with them to understand a journey life lessons and ask some questions that you are struggling with answer for this is one of those sessions that I had with them but what did you learn from the normally when you go for the session what happens if they give you one hour lecture and then you are given q&a for 30 minutes first time in my life I went for the session where we were sitting in a ovalroom on the corner of the walls were sitting like this and then he stands middle and disengaging the he calls it conversations it's not him talking and we listening so he says something and then it was a question to 1 question was the first question the US was what's the Legacy that you guys want to leave when you retire to picture yourself tell me one line was a Legacy you want to leave so few of the people by answering and then I just thatI want to live as I want to create Army of leaders who will create go on to create option success in their careers so keep it on this word of seniors are talking about his life is not a bad word why using this was the connotation and even want to know where you're from and like I said and I was in Australia for 15 years since that's where the bad word comes from are known for their casual humour and stand and finally gotten over the meaning of amessage about creating vehicles exercise huge success never expected success and I couldn't believe that for the next fifteen minutes Aegis left everyone is talking to me understanding what is this means to me and to him and he was selling his secretary that uses for our next quarter announcement that we were found in a Mahindra set of Sem results for the last quarter Insaaf The Tumble down to a guy and I couldn't believe that what happened and I didn't know that connection with Lhe was telling me that he used to own what is now called as Otis elevator Mahindra used to own ko on those days a 50-50 partnership with foreign companies in river zoning Elevators as well as we had some background and he was very curious to know about me and my my life and stuff so again somebody who is such a senior person one of the biggest industry list in India to talk to someone like me you know whose family nobody in front of him that was very humblewhat I learnt was humbleness got down to earth had his he come very privileged back family by the way what is said how the privilege this was crashed the first few years of his college education how we realise that he still has a long way to go and stuff so I learnt humbleness I learnt how do you always communicate and I learnt this whole conversation id I know so now I started doing it on my own lessons as well where is not one way Tokbut it's conversation on social what's the energy in the whole room like with all the see your coming together what happening it depends on the group but certain groups we can find a lot of and bigger than you really can happen because you know you're having some big guys with names and everybody wants to kya grab attention and somebody gets attention others are like which I was that person and of thing I alwayswanted because I am always the youngest have never had any session where even close to some metals right so I have ever used it to my advantage that I want to do with the words are of course while there is all this why does 12:00 Baje said was the wives of co creation learning from each other in networking engaging with each other so I connected a lot with people who is a very blessed that a lot of this came out after I got the ITA award last year in a row so that I am mad amazing peopleAnwar Bharosa Malai nasodha Sagar Daryani from wow Momo there was the Zomato guy that the top people consultants for McKinsey and company who wrote my fellow award winners and then you connect with them and then you realise that this generation of leaders are very down to earth ok and what what is the difference between this generation of leaders so you are with your morning 8082 anyone won the 18 how the different from sixties and seventies and legal issues that arise in the next time I get beaten up by few people who are 60but what you hear the stereotypical leaders are first for leaders have to tell people what to do that the first thing you always here like the boss boss tells me right that was told and the second thing you find this that the boss will never ask for feedback the possible always think he is right and he will set the tone for everything happening in the organisation and the boss will not be easily approachable three things that I've found which is so unlike mebecause I don't do any of the three and this is what I think the 80s and 90s leaders are extremely down to earth and there's a lot of stereotype type that is usually the 1676 use its the it is BITS Pilani is mackenzie's the world award of the full list of 40 most likely everybody was from it BITS Pilani I am or they are startup or they are McKinsey and company se concertab of these were totally fed of place when I walked in with my wife without you never knew each other we do not know anyone in free fire still remember asking the econsultant2 did the analysis and how did you find me they will I will go to find engineering companies having see you are less than 40 years old and that was very interesting know that engineering companies we have kept very traditional and that is a very attractive how many engineers really want to work for engineering companies in the end up going to Tatacutting or citizen in oven other software companies right where the money is better is more glamorous let people know engineering companies as a brand Unilever Pepsi is all there but not engineering companies right now getting better because of actor winners of the companies into social media and staff that I just want to add something new and this is a message to all the young listeners and this is coming state of my heart because I remember I tried starting for IIT in 11very soon realise it's not my cup of tea which is inevitable that had at that stage of my life and think everyone family members friends fellow students are called a ton of gang up until you know if you don't get iit you want amount to anything in life and is a version of this at every stage of your education weather tell you if you don't take this college Endeavour life and college life don't get this job in daily life fail and the life of the messages thatlet others dropout possible negative futures for you if their drawing on negative uterus is more of a reflection of themselves then you so you you keep thinking positive again just focus on learning focus on curiosity and just keep growing because trust me people don't even know what the scenario of jobs is group you like in 10 years all you can do at this stage of human history is like educate yourself these questions loan from past leaders should have in school teachers doing that because I had heard11th physics teacher in our life again again so you know I don't mean to sound mean but when someone says that too young student it's a reflection of them they have not been there is probably haven't made it in life so they think that this is also a possibility that will project my own insecurities on the young student he can't fight back to its very kind of adult form of bullying I will I once that's your tried it self esteemLike I Remember going to my 11 12 standard CET tuitions value of one Physics teacher traumatize kids like she would you know the toppers the person comes second or third in the dropdown to fourth or fifth sheet Shikshak tomorrow class 11th you anymore you let me down here I remember crying in classes like he was the Lil crazy and you're really traumatized children in terms of Advanced writing only the top to callthis to your great restaurant I guarantee on writing your life will be ruined your telling 16 year olds who do not any perspective on life for you really start believing and then it eats away at that what so when you ask me my friend to your how I felt in all this was in my mind in awe like I would never succeed and that what happened why we get so much of pressure from every one and only then friends who believe in you and staff who can give you the perspective that no no things will work will do well in the sun like the onetouch wood from engineering I didn't have good time in engineering colleges too many people just telling you would amount to anything it really affect my self-esteem and bad points am the one guy who is a good student is still one my closest friends and life I remember I didn't do too well in a particular exam and one of the teacher this is a General culture of the teachers ki take on the Northeast today on the student with tattoos of it but they basically he made the teacher made all the top of a class stand up and over 2my subject you what this ok good what do you get good at all the top as a 56 top even then he asked me the like the guy who is near the bottom and my friendsand you know it is a moment of friendship with season that but one moment hold on for engineering college like I will do anything I will miss all the parties I will miss all the good days but I want me is the birthday of that one guy who came example in school in fact somebody who's next level now Badi so proud of what I am doing and were inspired now looking at me so I think these are the people who have given you some where the driver of hope that things will be better but it is difficult to write right now be speaking aboutbecause I've gone through over it but plot of learners and sand in the people who are going to college right now experiencing it was busy suicides you hear about so many Treasures from social life that you have to do well and it's not just about looking good studying well having girlfriends all the social pressures right and Imagine why would the world go I am in this way the biggest change we have to do I think I think social media is bringing that they are truly like when I even go backAurora College now interactive the students as a different energy letters desine stories I'm really blessed that I was one of the store where it's like ok no people always total amount nothing no unexpected social media to come off as a concept to run Meme page in college Masti Ke Dole offensive memes on it but no one thought delete anything today Meme pages some of the highest revenue Honours in our industry so it's just you can't predict the future just believe in yourself feel that the message Pipli to takeif you have to boil down all your Journeys lessons episode 23.6 for the people who have failed were going to shit right now young engineers is on the chill out a little bit while in college WhatsApp message to them so I would say the 3 things to shortlist is first of all any experience a good experience so don't ever think that this is below my level or it's about my level I can't do it will come from anywhere and you just just do it don't do away fromit it it it is opportunity and whenever you get the opportunity to bring that wow factor you know don't just do it like everybody else put some effort to think how do I do this but I think that is a super super important finally I keep repeating it but I think it's important to have to brand yourself nobody brand new and when I will say not the so that matter visited a anybody in this room each of them havewhat is the brand is a friend in your friend you have a brand right or Ranveer his children school is a fitness gynae is a is a stylist this is your brand personality personality you know that is what will take you forever you know so you have to know what is your brand and your to know then what is a brand you have to be to get to what you want and how do you connect this is what the youngsters today should really really do connect with people network with people don't go to agiven to a normal party or networking events it by yourself if you can come to build challenge yourself so I think you have to do everyday things that is not normal not part of you so for example if you are a shy person new only talk to Ranveer everyday tomorrow going to talk to a new person in a small way maybe once a week 2 one person one some other one person to do things out of your comfort zone challenge yourself don't speak to this is what I know and I will do this comfort zone and people cipet your strengthsI'm not sure that the third thing in a brand yourself do things always better than what everybody has done and just keep doing different things you don't try to close on yourself do things different don't put any ceiling on yourself don't know anything about jobitus life that's what I'll make everyone successful adding just one more aspect what is adverb branding your one of India's top LinkedIn influencers and the corporate world is like very into LinkedIn today correct Odyssey LinkedInring as one of the big platform showing forward show what you are open houses viewed in the corporate world very interesting questions to ask me in many companies money engineering companies I don't think it is a very favourably because people see it as your putting yourself out there just for your branding and all that but I am my my answer back is if you don't brand your organisation who will write you don't have you know there is branding people but you are believe in your brand and you could put yourself out there andmake sure the people today know your branch in today in India people know Shimla more because of how active on social media combat main competitors right up there is a graduate from it so I am want who is offered role in gender and other similar company most likely they will you still love because they have heard about children from social media and the leader has to be out there talking to people to influence and to create that magic that he really or she or he or she is that really want to deliver to thewho want to join CEO LinkedIn is definitely the future there is no doubt about that you could use it properly you could use it not just to show off yourself but I think it's important to use it as a platform to teach people the my view is specifically how do I really helped the millennials become work ready with so many of them looking for jobs in Osho what to do the many of them come from very ordinary colleges 90%Delhi colleges maybe they failed then I got good schools have not got placement opportunities and staff they can also do really well if the use LinkedIn reach out to people yes lot of the Moon talk to you back but keep trying a lot through this medium and you learn a lot as well I will be connected on LinkedIn act and that's why I got to know you and write its history so I think people happy network in any form very underutilized part of social media especially in the side of the world I think so so anywaya good future so this is the end of the path to thank you so much for being a part of an I had a lot of fun feeling all of said Handle download especially his LinkedIn hand Figo follow me to go subscribe and I hope that if your a failure of 50 + told you that you are amount to nothing if people have told you that you won't do anything in life and it can even be your family this podcast should be or turning point also want to see where we can support these people so they want to approach me to LinkedIn automationturning point also want to see where we can support these people so they want to approach me to link another my social media and mentoring suggestions more than happy to help please create a better world on a person full all about creating the impact so from Mr Ashok Ramachandran and Ranveer allahbadia thank you"

man Radhakrishnan Pillai any human who knows as much about the history of India as this man does bring him to monkey tagglabs not made any one like that you grow your progress toward that India ko Sone Ki Chidiya Bulaya jata tha in the richest countries in the world should be breakdown exactly what made in India so rich in detail in the long termmovement stole money exactly from US and you also going alone how India is becoming rich again on Path was becoming on the richest countries in the world once again and human being part of that which was wave and make your own money through that wave if you want to become rich in life this is the episode for you so if you want to create the best possible future for yourself loan in detail about the past of this country what's the entire episode does a lot of value to be gained enjoyable one the smartest man in India doctor Radhakrishnan Pillaieven the most motivational episodes of monk-e chat with no talk about this Sone Ki Chidiya concept Bharat was once one of the richest countries in the world richest country in the world we went on to become one of the poorest countries in the world thanks to British rule thanks for your pain in regions and who better to talk about History than Radha sir welcome to monkey TATA Cancer we got off very openly about the whole concept my whole generation told that we were very rich at one point of failure and also told that they are part of the world's biggest secondfastest growing economy so all of us mind I generation will have a lot of wilderness will be among the world's richest people and their special generation with the other Focal Point vs Cena Paris generation which was kind of middle class and now I am dead sure that initial order reaches the story at the back so how did India get rich in the first place for scene in Times like we doing correct business selling a lot of in gymwhat was happening so many factors because of which India became very rich to begin with nature blessed us today if you look at it Geographic Li opposition very rightly be got the nature with all things that is very positive for an economic development for example if you look at it we can define seasons are many countries have it away rain is a new way summer season you are lot of greenery flora and fauna we got the ocean covid-19 coastlines if you look at it not many countriesadvantages some countries of completely dissolved some people and us know if you have the right mix the second is that it's quite surprising that we actually focused on research and R&D so every field that even if you look at it 1000 years back we were the people who contributed so you look at metallurgy we will get architecture as we had built the best monuments across the globe III the most important thing is that we had a very different and interesting social systemcannot become rich individually rather than the community that family so what happened is earth summary for located the kind of a profession that we follow during those Early Times very well defined and structure let me go back and it's quite surprising that you may never have heard about a process called as jaati Puran wood jaati people say Mein jaati Vibhag ho raha hai jaati is actually profession and every profession has actually had an SOP standard operatingthousand years ago on a doctor and of course if your parent was a doctor and you want to be a doctor and your children want to a doctor there is a process and you follow the family business if you don't want to be a doctor or so we can leave but thousands of years may be 1015 generations have perfected the particular art of medicine and Research it was documented the shipping business it was documented so if you look at why India is the richest country in the world that we did a lot of things simultaneouswhat many generations have gotten the perfect system and what happened is that you've lost that putting the continuity of knowledge evolution Technology walls as when we kept learning and that learning process stop it stop exactly so if you go back to the past by the whole world came to us with which part of the world even though we were trading with other countries very very selfish and nature I am in country nature gives that Patel opportunity with thing is that after so manystations of foreign Nations were lost on so many things which actually made the richest man in the world like for example the traditional businesses are getting challenge instead of evolving it is actually getting shot of a specific example do you know Gujarat actually was the point where lot of trading and shipping is happen if we look at the Gujarat coastal belt in the actually the foreigners came through that route the passes came from that and today it Britishers actually changed from Gujarat toMumbai Lord of communities who are very good in shipping industry in boat building in shipbuilding in Gujarat their lot of ports are there why did the British to this day intentionally wanted to spoil this thing about India ki galti se let me go back to the history of British British actually are a part of a particular community or a particular group which cameropan Europe if you look at it looks very beautiful scenic wise but if you look at my other side of it doesn't have that much natural advantages that we have so there are you know it and rain anytime so many pluses and minuses actually explore the world full of trade activities in the land of in India actually it was East India company which is the trading company you hear about it and the French and the Spanish the came as a trade opportunity because we had spices we had TV headeverything in the world which did not have this is not very popular in Europe that you get if you go to European today actually the eat very bland food varieties of khana have food Hai masale hai so when they came in the actually never thought that it became a trading will install the East India Company became so big the British Parliament and all the Queens and all the intellectual ok no you have your own little office your it became so we have grown Army also and suddenly East India company which is the trading comeactually became a revenue for the British shows that will last a lot of traditional practices and Britishers actually broke many of them the shipping industry actually got destroyed in its on whether the whole industry is that we had a study social practices we don't see much of them continuity quickly name three other things like the shipping industry that got destroyed so let me you speaker speaker Ayurveda Ayurveda was part of dada Dadi ki kahaniyan Nadi will enableshe tell you enough to use where do you have the system today in India look down upon a society in a lot of Ayurvedic massagearandi district second is yoga systems getting the system of yoga and yogic teachers and be mentioned about this the previous episodes of kriya yoga Patanjali yoga sutras of systems of yoga and Ayurveda yoga everything on the third industry which are definitely want to talk but we were actually people who give the best metal metallurgy to the world we were actually people who knew what to do with metals ok I didn't make good weapons or like anyAshok metals and its applications of app in array is one part of it but if you look at the ornaments country full of gold in all the temples built in Tirupati you are you go to Kerala audio today we have this temples where gold is given without girls without a blacksmith that no village was complete so there was something 86 like villages Hubli every particular village had those which they were so evolved and let me tell you what Arthashastra Arthashastra is a very good document of going back to Indian2401 Shivay whether it's for the world we actually be the first to have coinage systems ok instead of butter in water + coinage of water is one of the important event today blue waters and Osho on my way movie Do barter system continues this more about understanding in I give give me thatcommonly accepted by both to India for those of us who actually had it system must be for all these banking system nollywood important is that we had certain very very futuristic vision and very sustainable in today we talk about sustainability as a Keyword animal models and that is exactly why India was the richest in the world then what went wrong while they will use ola money stop research so one day you think that we actually lost controlprove that the Invaders ke responded but I feel that if something went wrong them something went wrong in your house is well there are multiple theories to its we are not here to find out what went wrong and answer is this but is a combination of various things let me start with saying what Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel one side Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on the greatest leaders that our country saw he was once asked do believe Britishers have the policy of divide and rule he said noHorses and their rule statement and fighting and whenever there is a woman who has come to understand Hote Hainunderstand what is happening in the West the very happy to the scientific development that happened in the West where either cut off for not giving it too much importance for example the industrialisation that happened steam engines and all those in the whole generation with Britain had a scientific advantage was so Britain did something correct in that face and your everything correct and that was going to lot of movements within themselves the French Revolution husband it was found that there are so few read the worldwhat is the messenger of the society is questioning whistles and pushing it Sel to something I have a look at the European Model was touched upon hilbert in Japan and some other parts of the world but then we hear the American to get rid of what causes question what went wrong on our philosophy teachers at a very nicely the Britishers left us and we accept the Americans will never actually became Indians so what happened and what really happened wrong if I havesinger in the world was putting lot of efforts time into the next generation what is required for Indians for with printing papers and our documentation was still in Palm leaves were talking about Missionaries and you know and we were still doing that in handwoven wrong but when they came in be solved with the British scientific development we are fighting with Suits and they were actually having kinins why is this was the reason why we get it would be hand and anybody who is properly working in the fieldindustrial revolution that wow most important economical angles write up in the people differently from people get attracted to their models we came here and made as their servants really appreciate them in one way Imagine The Babu so and the British Empire was actually Indians to the higher the best of the paint them very well give them a government job Mein dam collectors and the collectors are Indians Nami which contain Indian actually took all the moneySabhi never actually had the idea of sitting down analysing it and when it really hate everyone is looking for their own personal gain absolutely and some well that's a very interesting point give a little bit selfish is it I me and my family doesn't matter about what's happening to the village with a modern day with a lot of Indians living India and going abroad for giving them said the better life for the cal intellectual theft braintree two reasonsthe government level and another individual level if the government doesn't have the opportunity to create then you feel frustrated driver from qualified to do something for the country but there is no ecosystem is changing now with you know the ecosystem of startup India all things happening but yeah but what happened the pros Independence 1947 you look at it took was almost like 40 50 years to actually look back even now the best of the brain's go and doing very well abroad the Google than the Microsoft are run by Indianvery interesting statement that we used to have when we were young and colleges in the saying it's better to have brain drain rather than having brain in the dream but I am saying is changing so where did we go wrong probably thought about my benefits we went abroad how many people stayed back and say ok India may not be the most developed country but I'll make a developed country is very good American get the money thatunified country but then it was not one unified country actually be got freedom not from Britishers alone India was not in a country does 550 princely states when Britishers left India we were not one nation with three Geographic Li administrator country we had Bombay Presidency Kolkata Presidency and mattress Presidency administrator otherwise it was Raj Gharana what Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did is called as the Statue of Unity and had a department calledpattern of states 3 actually combined 550 princely states and this has the Kashmir for not solved Kashmir was a princely state of the biggest challenge you are observed upon the ground that we did not have one common common government system it is only after the constitution of India was formed everybody is now a learning to one particular form of governance sweating the right because it's easy to break 550 people and break 1 complete Nation that we went wrong so so my next was induced did the British do any chimtiwhen you're going to de do anything to like messes up and leaf or was their intention good and you know they want to do the best forest life what what you are taken that so I would look at this from two angles with that generation message I don't know because I don't understand nowold why people on delivery service that reaches from is a problem like we have been told that have customers a problem that research was a problem in the royal families a so-called current Royal families race is a major thing I think about in Europe in Europe tours Europe now specifically when Britishers the ruling as they have different Strategies and everybody knows about the Macaulay education model the ke manager it make a plan to describe these people at the intellectual levelso what is tomorrow is it todaydoes not consider the possibility that Eastern science must be way beyond Western side but you win condition to think that was once and certain school should be little the whole idea of everything that comes on the west is good and everything worked in tennis bats and as rightly pointed out it's a myth that spirituality is not scientific and biological locate Patanjali yoga Sutra it's a system which is scientificParichay spirituality and Science always one the broken of Engineering spiritual and a scientific scientific not so you can be yogi and appreciate the same time and pharisees actually I think was a scientist or different waves very bad that actually lost on generations of scientific development Avenue built temple architecture if you look at Kedarnath very specifically to unke month quakes ke mother temple the Jyoti Instagramscientific Tok WhatsApp status ecosystems we will look at Rameshwaram the same Shiva temple right in the south to you know it's actually receive back you're not going to Rameshwaram please go you were surprised that it from the banks of the sea seashore and that's from a Rama Banta Lanka I have seen this architectural studies in detail you'd be surprised that those particular temple is designed in such a way that if a flood comes in of the mean of the sea water comes in it comes into the temple and within 5 minutes Dianadrainage system is so perfect if you look at the kind of architecture temples been done in Ajanta Ellora I mean you see the paint the actual paint which was used the pigments it is being there for more than Thousand Years paint kharab Nahin Hota Hamare Yahan per paint Lagate area your do something about itSamay last and of course very important economically the Britishers able to give you some model economics revision 200 rupees is Humko that things are changing what happening of things are changing we read about two important factors in the history of India becoming rich after independence one was an Eagle liberalization of the Indian economy which is then Manmohan Singh opened up the call so very simply to junior KG student can you explain that unlike few sentenceswhat happened happened in 1991 what happened post independence 1947 A very poor Nation everything was looted the overall Treasure is my empty will not food to eat before a voltron country in a lot of things and the growth rate every year after independence in 1991 someone or 2% vegetable and the population between four times so when we got independence on 30 crores and son x** closed now so you have the same problemx 4 x educate the area to feed them and give them job I really pretty those people who actually worked for the nation post independence interesting is that coming back if 1991 what happened doesn't simple layman's language is started getting money which we did not have the foreign funds funding India so 1999 means what suppose I will start something company which require 100 crores Miami have 20 crores obituaries the my from maybe we are model livestocknet exam form filling sample trees in 37 big plant and machinery and all those in FDI n FIR foreign direct investment and foreign institutional investment this is what actually happened 1991 lot of people started saying that ok Mona give you hundred crores what will be my benefit is a lot of resistance because till 1991 people thought that you know if you allow another group to coming to India will be like the Britishers the communist leaders in the Lutonare you stupid that you're not learning from the mistake the Britishers did you telling the American company and the Japanese coming to come again and US money don't be stupid of a time I think the maturity walled and thanks to our then Prime Minister Narasimha off and then you are the Finance Minister Manmohan Singh became the Prime Minister said ok it's important that we can't of ATK Tumse le liya Zaroorat Hai and what happened is that we did not to get money but we actually got the best practicesIndia give you a specific example I remember I was a part of 1991 generation when we never understood what is whole Liberation and all those things it took 10 years for Indian you to understand it can actually be understood what is the impact of globalisation liberalisation in the year 2000 in the IT industry Gardens biggest boob problem call Y2K should do a little bit of research and it should be all on computers have become another but suddenly in 99IIT 1999 people avoid the year 2020 good to change in a new Millionaire 200 everything in computers was actually coded as dates said that if you don't get it right maybe the aeroplane will collapse because the computers gives instructions to computers work on something colour bits and bytes 1 and 2 1999 the moment it becomes 2012 o'clock January 1st 2020 the whole system will go and as a backup plan they were the intelligent people who can do recodingdecoding and encoding and decoding tricks Indian web based and hold two to three years we got in the Global platform does one impact the second impact that happened in liberalisation period was basically be not just get money but we got the Global best practices into India for example when you look at a McDonald's in India and you will get a McDonald's in maybe New York with the same we don't just get magnons in India but you C deficiency the culture the work cultureexactly happened that it's not just getting money would you actually getting trained by them with their money field officers of the following companies coming here today if I would probably be the JP Morgan here and I go to Singapore officer don't feel headphones what is very important to the blessed in a way that we don't have to travel abroad to see different world we can actually see that would in any way in India that was a turning point in 1991 and take those ideas and work culture and start Indian business in Indiathat's what I feel a generation money will be based Indians are beautiful Businessman may not be the best elevator doors that should I will American the fantastic innovators that's debatable but I will Indians are fantastic taking an idea tweaking it making it the sea and selling it so I will look at it differently in saying that we are already natural innovators in between Weir actually been told not to innovate the psychology of the following rulers and the education systemopen doors that we were nation which could actually design anything and everything that we wanted imagine putting up and erotic image in a temple on the temple Hamein wasn't that innovation with an idea which people will not accept socially today we give the best of the ideas I'll tell you after study the lord of Indian architecture go to any ancient Indian temple which is Thousand Years Old maybe North or South there are similar looking plus everyhusband in different design it is not mass production coming back what happened innovation is something which is in readynas but with the Britishers in Aligarh on it you listen to attend the boss culture give the creativity dialogue what happened you absolutely rightly said that now with money and we require one generation of parents to phase out and telling them somewhere the parent generation will tell this do and don't do this and ok I am not independent generation doesn't have experience but they have an expiryhaving of followers means you are generation the advantage of a leadership mentioned in this talk was in and we have to change your mind set from a follower ship thinking to leadership thing and that's the advantage you have if you have an idea you get funds to market your technology we did not have the advantage of social mediaunderstand Karta Hai 12 and the other aapko Pata mein kya karta hunI know I experimented I am not saying that all of them will succeed but all of them will not fail either and this is something I want to tell all the youth of India is getting to the positive mindset in the American mindset of innovation and investing into an idea is slowly coming to India but it is not its maturity level somebody asking Bill Gates about it was supposed to have an idea experimented invest on it and what if it fails in water Bill Gates answerBollywood sexy it's this something so importance of windmill parents who is doing something is doing what it pains its opposite what it sucks Americans and innovation it's not about failure failure is bound to happen with dozens of soap in one product succeed I am sure that if I did not succeed in the mindsetit work doing something good I will partner with you invest with you to get into this and the last and most importantly required is mentoring experimenting so much and your with full of energy ideal but either way it's always better to take the way from somebody is more mature than finding energy innovation Idea capital Mani along with may be a mentor will make the whole difference and will become the results for the work much fasterback to the game with you are taught me IT infrastructure but when I look at and but when it awkward infrastructural not talking about building office I am talking about internet infrastructure which I believe Mukesh Ambani has put into the youth and through the US and is not me fanboy Reliance when we go into lakh 2045 2015 to look back at 2016 and that was a defining moment in the Indian economic boom because the internetvillages ok maybe I will not using jio today's what people are using a cheaper version of vitality Idea Vodafone all that so the internet is reaching everywhere it getting educated much more rapidly will be creatingimpact the people sitting city is also able to make the one Level black and the same level platform what is it problem the village is something odd in Bombay and services to the jio example it interesting that I remember Mukesh Ambani actually coming to Mumbai University and who was the chief guest of a convocation ceremony said something and when he said this it was actually for me a very different outlook of a businessman his head till now we're focusing on oil because Reliance Petroleumwhat is the major cash cow or cash flow come from all the petroleum perfect ending today is he said that are is the next oil what is actually it's not internet its data and I know people who actually told me this who are youtubers vs youtubers not like you the way they had to actually have bigger server farms because the consumption of India is gone 10 times biggerthere is an impact on that what actually made is the jio phone everybody in the different platform in sync data Kaise Le free mein le le number mera WhatsApp and believe me the world cannot exist without Indian data 16 of the billion people with a Google or Facebook Twitter Instagram they are all having offices in India rate in LinkedIn cannot exist without even with an American company andthe culture today may be the Prime Minister is promoting a government infrastructure please write on the way you please Road on the way of the culture 20 years ago we had the advantage of being that generation that define Indian professionalism and it can today be ruled the world tour it means you're go across any country we Indians are there in IT field your generation will be the data field the digital infrastructure rule it and ithow to roll number one is that you use it as a medium of education and business what are the business model understand but you know what is happening there is something called as soft power economical power what is economic role I can make my order to do this particular botcast will get likes will get video as all of its economic model can use the same platform to educate people on certain platform for example what we are doing a bit of history which often about Indian culture let me tell you my dear friendslook at problem to create a video on Chanakya area when I started learning Chanakya probably 20 years ago I didn't even know Chanakya today by the grace of God and know something about Chanakya but there are actually 1 billion people in India who don't know Chanakya suddenly realise one thing to 1 billion people don't know your market actually 7 billion people in the nature of incident or knows about Chanakya he doesn't but if you educate them will come to youmorning until you're special today my head person call Michael rafel I don't even know actually it's me and get in touch with me the last one year this guy has been fallen for me and never actually did a background process of you Michael is and then right Main Long main is actually an European trying to find the identity is not from India his migrated to India just because his sword with Indian music system in India doesn't know about Indians aur Indian knowledge with the word is No1 inwhen I say how do you make YouTube and the social media we believe me that 7 billion people are frustrated they don't have a direction and life don't have a purpose in life that knowledge to what the superficial knowledge we have another level is something which problem we can give quality inputs to fit talk about yoga to de do yoga and become a product or service for 7 billion people during Arthashastra can do that Indian wisdom Indian Ayurvedic and use this platform toIndia software who believe it or not attack people have Indian Vedic systems mathematics is there were so many things first study yourself to you know I'll give you 4 steps if you don't mind can I use a little bit of a Sanskrit words it is supposed to take any food in the field and you decide which field and our Indians have done solid research work in the past and advocate give you politics the most hottest talking everybody Talks about the social media politics so ok we talk about Narendra Modiok ok let me study and ok in India we actually got democracy post 1947 we are always a country of monarchy 2,000 actually technically democracy is a new thing for organsecond step is Anubhava practice it was a don't glorifying and price on the internship to study fi study Chanakya 50 miles and third is called prachar what is the chairman share it would like a missionary not enough convert somebody's in the Indian is the best I am making aware of this is also the temperature and the fourth and the most important is document it is very important to actually protected soShastra ko Humko bacha Ke Rakhna hai to Shastri Parampara lawn tractors promoted documented we can do the four steps taken to be applied chemistry you taken take Biology aeroplane increasing the Pushpak Viman tha I don't know studied take a protocol going to make a model of a turn that this is an Indian model of aeroplane to get some mathematical Pythagoras Theorem take a gravitational did you decide Natya Shastra Arthashastra ka Masuda you describeexperiment to find everything is spiritual find the beauty of India will come to which country in this product the world is given every knowledge finally reaches you do Supreme with a better than colour self actualization use social media for that that was a general kind of help that you put out there on the selfish and ask you as the mental Mangi you mental I willmyself and others what do we do to become the Elon Musk the Steve Jobs of India now ok student of your space that you need to put out of a time you should get into structures and show your working on that the secondwhich is very important for you are not thinking about getting the government policies ok I know this is gonna come right social media was a government policy remember one thing Government of India specifically is big about social media video only created a platform baby all these channels but you know you can actually get into policy decision making because in our country social media is not structured you can structuredreview specific example when we started our generation IT infrastructure some guys experiment in here and there is a Bangaloredoing something you are doing something I felt it big it's very big but if you don't partner with the government can kill you will kill you but they can because the power of the government can never be underestimated to fall ill last fight annual what are you done was a baby step now you think like an industry anytime triplicate Film Industry Industry station just ten years ago this country has been having films 100 yearsand the little like making films creativity innovation Raja Harishchandra black and white antham Raj Kapoor and schedulesector you get capital and Labour Minister will tell you what to do and what not to do and you can the Minister what we want and you don't want to social media as a platform is a very baby stay you can see the growth and you'll be surprised it's going to be a giant and a monster which can eat you butafter 10 years can one be sure not just be a show Ranveer maybe 10 youtubers down and go to the PMO which the film industry is going by the best of the think this is what you want the tax benefit we want this we want people and today the film industry wall to such an extent that today we have a Bahubali which actually get hundred crores tomorrow we want investment you can actually get organised in which state and probably kill list your company in stock market the first things are Modi jiSuper Singer structure yourself second grade the government was and last the most important thing is that ask yourself exit exit teacher in the Indian wisdom you will be away from baby after 20 30 50 years but the organisation that you start the completed you structured with Just another questionIndustries that grow so for example probably Raj Kapoor is gone right in the company of a diversion time job is not sleep because I Apple Apple continues to grow after Steve Jobsyoung energetic team will make it better if India and Bollywood has got somebody colours Dharma Production Karan Johar during the foundations of Dharma Production is not Karan Johar it actually is father of the things that after three generationsChanakya bridge and Empire season what would happen after 100 years after may be fined reduce the foundations of social media should be so strong and sustainable model for generations to come up with Innovation and adapt to the change that what are the different industries that young India should look at and that's whyand Marwadi communities Gujarati comedy know this very well Roti Kapda Makan people will it isn't the food industry will always be there are a lot of innovation Kapda we like fashion fibre housing infrastructure but we have forgotten that one of the key industries for Indians travel love to travel alone just came back from Nagpur industry hotel industry is interconnected actually don't give importance to travel in this country travel is not a career it is something that you do Logistic Libig letters and unfortunate the Jet Airways failed in such an industry management system but it's not good for economy travel blood when I speak to other people are the career options engineers doctors told that the whole idea is that it never look that travel which is India's biggest thing there are countries which are dependent on travel get singapore many other countries how can we not look at it was coming back to the younger generation should give importance to travel set an industry profile is very important to know isanything and everything connected to heritage heritage is coming back in a big way for example again thanks to Modi ji is promoting Lord Of Cultural tourism but cultural tourism is not over the travel I already told about Travels when you go to a particular place can you hold them to a resource if you go to Ujjain temple Ujjain Temple know there is a system of knowledge and if you go to your grandfather came to the templeif you actually go to places like Tirupati or you go to Kerala then knowledge system we don't know what are young people can get into the search very important if you look at current budget Nirmala sitharaman first female full time finance minister actually has announced a huge huge huge point for R&D research and development and Research Centre do research on social media actually can candidGovernment of India for any particular feel it I am not thinking the futurePatanjali Baba Ramdev yoga product theek hai the research is the future becausegoing up because they will

two sexes don't have the same minimal obligatory transconductance of example women had just if you look at the Grammy 30 NM and ejaculation their 250 million dollar has 400 ambulation so winner women's oven is is much more expensive than a man from the right product already is the thing with the square of two women women have tothe definition of cost will have to bear the likelihood of charge for also the reason that has a minimal parantu investment you much larger for women when it does for men therefore we expect women to have a wall much more stringent make for a study that why women are much less interested in engaging in short-term making not that there are some time there but much less so than menJatt Sada turn on having you in the Ranveer show I've learnt so much from you of the internet and I think is a dream come true that I get some time with you do pick your brain and take your knowledge to the rest of the worldyou are one of the world exports on evolutionary psychology the first we could you explain why audiences and imagine that audiences are just 45 years old what is the evolutionary psychology of evolutionary theory to the study of the human mind in the same way that we can use evolution study why we have a portable fan why are pancreas are the way they are it simply in this case the application ofthinking to know why it is the almonds are the weather why do we experience with you why do we have certain field responses how do we choose made in the making market of everything that we are the magic of quadcopter matters but be below culture exist some fundamental principles that makes the Lebanese consumer and the Indian Consumer very similar to each other because we share biological Heritage and so that portablewhy did a teenage Gad Saad want to go down this path in life that I was a very and so and also I would always be interested in the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom that eventually become a professor at know which field I will be a professor in political news in the endtranslation and then my teenage years in Europe to buy professionally and in Eastern Canadian championships I had a devastating injury and so my soccer Kabir was over and Soul in packed them out then Hai then quickly transition is academia how I became an evolutionary and consumer psychologist is during my backtraining at Cornell University my former director of supervisor Devru service very famous Tamil psychologist at the suggested I take in advance for psychology course with German my name of effective than its region and about half way through the Koti assigned a book called homicide by two of the pioneers of EAMCET according Google send and Martin daily and in the birthday explain patterns of criminality using evolutionary lensaha moment I would take this incredible Framework reservation alfalfa framework and apply it to the study of consumer behaviour is a book behind you that you were released recently why why what we intention in writing the book in 2020 common sense is too great was in my lifein fact one of the book the first weight war was the Lebanese civil war and literal physical war where we are Lebanese juice you are for the last group of Jewish people who were in Lebanon and the will of the sole reason for leave even though many Jews had already left on the Avengers civil war broke out in the next seven years in the came rather impossible situation level on the we had to escape The brutality of Waractually were Kidnapped by father and so the surprise for the child in the truly horrible that actually made me very cognizance of The ugliness Identity politics because it showed me what happens when a society is organised using fibre line in this case the tribal identity is based on your religious long as even their loving is constitution is based on the prime minister has to be an Astrologerexposure to the tribal thinking then remove the Canada In Hyder online training as serving the Weston back to be a professor in Canada and then I started seeing the sudden brake light face which was the war on University campuses on reason on virgin on common sense on science because they were also of discipline that were teaching staff were completely satisfiedvictory insane and so then I or iPad ok well have to meet me in the scandal insanity and there I agree that it is there are use principal from neuro parasitology is the study of parasites can affect a host of example it take one can enter your intestine and large intestine in neuro parasite is one that actually goes to the brainhouse of you take a parasite plasmodium be able to inspect the the greenhouse mice such that a mouse will do it in 1 feet of cash become sexually attracted to the cash during which is not really a good thing for the head and salt is principal and then I'd argue a my 46 plus years as a professor that humans to suffer from another class of drink parasite I call is ideaBihar ideas that in the same whether an actual parasite can cause the house to behave in rational ways these ideas can cannot be the best of infinite and so I trace word is bad idea confirm that come from the university it takes intellectual the come I would really dumb ideas and now and then I I trace the trajectory I explain the idea passages and then I aftertrying to identify a vaccine against coronavirus I try to identify a vaccine against this type of this order thinking and if you like to discuss examples of some of these ideas no of course please that I was going to be my next question you think something postmodernism this is the granddaddy of that actually argues that there are no objective truthwe are completely shattered by subjectivity VR shackle by a personal bias is there is no point in seeking an absolute objective truth hold on hold like by saying no objective truth you mean nobody knows what the writing is correct or left wing is correct of this religion character that religionhouse for a celebratory dinner myself my wife him and his date forgiving and so prior to us going out he had given me a heads up to tell me that his death in question was a graduate student in postmodernism in cultural anthropology and radical feminism for the holy trinity of motion and so and so I basically I hope you can say about it on youryou can say whatever you want you are telling me this to sort of candle want me in a let's let's be an hour best behaviour because you're gonna get into because I am going to be on my best behaviour which of course was not true and say about half way to the evening I turn to this lady in question And I asked her why here are you start your horse martinus yes do you mind if I ask if I proposeyou someone I consider it to be university rules and then you can tell me you after the universal structure that no they are not propose what I think I do know that there is it that only Women Air Jordan shoesSpark Scala shirodhara ise my stupidity and sells only women and children is no tell that is because there is some tribe of some Japanese islands were within their mythological folklore it is the men who their children so why you restricting the conversation to the biological Ram that tell you he person of Bedford inok such an extent that you can see that only women give you a less controversial example is it true that from anywhere on earth can always rely on the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west and he or she is something from deconstructionism is subfield of modernism what she said what do you mean by East and West addresswhat do you mean by the sun that would you call the sun on my call dancing hai na to which I answer find the banking Hai Lena rises in the east and sets out to your question postmodernism is not saying they are not choose when it comes to what are the right wing on the left we accept gravity is a source of such differences are social construct theirstaying as there is no such thing as the sun also to the famous physicist at the New York University had written a paper esoterica paper of hooks paper in 1996 he published in one of the top postmodernist journals academic journal where he was arguing that gravity is a social construct and the rest was being said there was a paperand it was accepted in the journal so that he went and sat up and get admission to make it all nonsense it's Jabra for a road is over that proves nothing because meaning is subjected to imagine when you are training generations of students to insert of learning Engineering and the economics and neuroscience you teaching them on the current nonsense that's a bad person ideas that one example I will give youwatch got in fact about the world in the last 10 years I think many things and I was 620 in the book I think one example is we lost our will to the pend freedom of speech freedom of enquiry there is now Forbidden knowledge there are things that you should I study because it might hurt someone's feelings they are saying that you shouldn't the sky when you are discussing power that defies is offensive its releases like like what I could giveobject example we want to be careful when you studying sex differences to study such differences if the findings come out according to the politically correct position a finding comes out that women are superior to men on some task then you should publish that and you behave the way they found that if you publish research that shows that on a particular memory as men performed better overall coronavirus USAstudent study and duration of the fences only not the biggest would do that so that there isn't a class of things that you are allowed or not in terms of the public discourse and I discussed the same what are the chapters of the person to write about ostrich to show you thatgo and blow up this train station because of these 17 different reasons that is prescribed by my religion and I am doing that only because of my religion there is no other reason I'm doing this because of my religion and then when the terrorist chemistry act all of the progressive nuanced centres will come out and say it's because of climate change its because of design is occupation it's because of British MPHD Kajal beard growing its because of the drought in Syria it's because of lack of exposure it because of alienation it's because of The Lone wolf is I'm so there are several different reason that the come up with that reject what people do in his own word which is I am doing this because by religion 2018 full of how people decide to reject realityfind to protect a particular in an arid someone's feelings davians do whatever the world being too sensitive that basically what does so get you know I read this beautiful thing about his story is a concept what's the point of being a historian a point of history as you study History so that you can predict the future and therefore I tried to make it a slightly better future and I would apply that same logic to Revolutionary psychology that you studiedhuman history in a way to find the history of the human mind and therefore able to predict what's going to happen going forward to do you think that by 2013 2014 2015 also keep in mind technological advancements like neuralink and things like that was going to happen to our minds like a v becoming smarter abhi becoming stupid are you coming be more sensitive or is this just phase-iv just going through a phase of being oversensitive about everything that the fact that you studydoesn't necessarily mean that you can I find product you predict the future because what evolution does is it operates within a particular environment to then create change it right so when it comes to the evolution of a gene that allows you to synthesise lactose right for some there are some cultures where they have a gene that allows them to self and black person other cultures the dawn was thatactually involved within a few you know generation sure you have the selection process that it comes to the fact that we now have ten fingers there is likely not going to be any selection pressures that I can think that's going to alter the morphology our hands to go from 10 finger 211 you have admin so sofa face to change so that they becomesweet within the human species it can take a lot more than 2030 or 2052 for any sofa Dam Tak today we we have DNA paternity testing I want to know if your journey is my child I can actually do alienate eternity test to know is my not right but are you man mine has evolved into a time when we didn't have the energy to 30% of example the fact that menvery sexually territorial the fact that they don't accept that they women go with other men is not due to the hate it but it's because it is in Revolutionary solution to the very real threat of the Trinity uncertainty right we are able to run two species meaning that both men and women invest heavily in that children can show your ancestors and mine come from a for men who didn'tappreciate the woman going and treated with years of my life in a child that mine now I am I saying always put together so even though they are DNA paternity test that would allow me to absolutely know what the journey is my brain has and had a chance to catch up to that we are because my brain is a Revolutionary solution to problems that existed Revolutionary task but for the next billion users50 Dawood remove my evolved sexual jealousy then what happen but it would be by 2030 if yes when they any good you put a rough number as to when it could be is it in the year 3000 the dog behaviour on the specific some straight away said could really a valve very very rapidly and some trade take you know 2100it's very tired I will be giving your company when the number itself as the turning on the trade the rate at which that it becomes fixative in the species that was so basically for the last two million years or so human being the evolving and for bulk of the 2 million years we didn't have writing we didn't have religion with an organised society and other things that we did then in our daily life have got stuck in a genetic Sanam mind today so keep that in mindalso ask you other relationship based human traits that surprised you as a student as a person who studies Revolutionary psychology things that just jumped out at you you send ok that's how my relationships are affected that's why I think like this as a Gai what were those nuggets are exposed to the power of Revolutionary thinking it trulyyour understanding of human behaviour your you know have have a unit not have a Universal explanatory ki to explain enlist different behaviour right so what are the things that I thought my students whenever we started course family teaching and MBA course on consumer behaviour and I tell you explain to you the Revolutionary in biological roots of our consumer behaviour Aisa long but just for you should know I am not teaching you a recipehow to be a better market much bigger I am offering you a Universal keep on the sunny human behaviour how you choose to then applied to the platinum you in different ways and what is that happen is 5 years down the road I will get some former student who write the main self I just had a fight with my wife about advisor and I remember your lecture on the evolution of romantic jealousy and exactly explains whyso so evolution through we allow you to understand on the one or more all the things that happened there was nothing more directly on the WhatsApp prices me really surprised me is the extent to which humans have a use report for faster behaviour we can be unbelievably loving Cooperative altruistic and also withopposite which can be brutal abusive genocidal and so I guess that's what makes the study of human nature so at Soda shop in a sense a dog has all of the noble qualities that we should have without any of our fault it is Loreal it is protective it is optimistic that has all the low because these without any of the fall I think you will develop more complexloving and caring and bruin germicidal typing maybe that's what are the things that both sad but also verify in the study of human condition is there any chance you have any predictions about the year 2030 like what can happen in this decade because of coronavirus could you quantify happiness and keep that is the subject theme of this question that you think will become happy people it is a very very fasthuman race will become happy your life happy I think that there are certain recipes and prescriptions that given file to optimise your happiness and discuss this was the day on which Guwahati movie poster today example doing something that you are truly passionate about most of your day is spent at work by most of your waking hours spent Rasoiso if you look at the shadow of your life that you are spending at work itself rather large part of your life now imagine if you either spending that I'm doing something that you really hate you have to do is just because the job or if you are lucky enough to find something that you could do as a job but that also when you great happiness and and passion of course not everybody has the luxury of making that shows but if you do have the possibility to think about how tochoose the right thing that's a really important half the happiness what are the reason why I wake up every morning incredibly Happy Birthday charge in a Candy Store is because I love what I do if I'm working on a book and sticking to a part caster that has a big show in the am not doing that I am speaking to undermine graduate students and we discuss wonderful the as a form of doing that there is always an end this number sources of weight by which ironhappy to be one way by which we can achieve happiness is pick the right life partner right and again it sounds easy but hard to read for men but I truly think that if if if your life partner is also the person with whom you truly want to spend all your time with my wife is really my best friend it's not as though she's my wife and I want to hang out and have fun with my mailI like to do sex with her and if you could find a partner who appreciate who you are and vice versa respect I think you've already on your way to finding happiness because you're spending most of your day doing a job that you love you come home at night to a person that you love and respect you are there is only sleep less and so that the path to the happiness I can tell you what are you man it would be happy but I can tell you that there are specific request recipesperceive maximizer absolutely love how you encapsulated the two best aspects of your life and used as a blueprint Dobara completely agree and allow me to add a third factor to that for you and I remember seeing a GRE episode where are you beginner talking about your daughter and father myself but I imagine that fatherhood is the third factor that really adds meaning and purposeARY Episode 12 given me alone now become my family had come with me to be job at any time before and she gave me this level now and I show it to Georgia I am the wealthiest man in the world because of this note and and I don't see the hyperbolic I'm being literal that you know when you have a family that you that you love and love you bad I know my in the Middle East and culture and I don't mean to sell your type but there isof your children Sheriff and acquire the grown-ups arcing write the hierarchical system like that I'm sure there are people that you want a record and so what I speak to my children what are the greatest joys I get my my children and value and every young digital quality on what's your book about so now I actually have to remember that the sorry sorryplease please send me my audience is made up of young children how do I take these ideas and put them in such a way that my Charitra what we say that they are parasites in the brains of animals and humans will be processed for the screws and so there is nothing more beautiful magical than seeing your children grow up so I would agree with you father does it on motherboard is certainly has an effort to ponakam I'm good I'm with youyou know that that's the thing again from doing this podcast you say that you love your life because you get study your favourite subject to get it awkward favourite subject to get good people in it through the science experiments the reason I love my job is I get it ok to older people like yourself simo the world to see more of life I also feel that you know you guys had a luckier than US in terms of people in the twenties today and teenagers of today have a more pressure because of whatmedia tells us that the version of life should be where you get that have that much access to information and that actually was a blessing so keeping in mind evolutionary psychology again I I believe that your human brain is a limited sponge it can absorb a certain level of Information and beyond that the prince was breaking down because I just to have you a lot to hold so I mean book keeping in mind the social media generation and all the mental health issues using all over the worldare you be afraid also keep in mind young daughter who grew up in this world what do you think of her future social media is both a blessing and a purse write as most engine life so it is a blessing in that it allows connections to happen that otherwise would have never had you and I would have never met you had never reach out to me maybe you have never been exposed to my ideas were thereso so I can appear on the Joe Rogan shop and you know within a week canadian people have downloaded this so so there is a velocity is speed of information transmission that is wonderful to from the perspective of a professor and I am ready to Java IDE to create new knowledge and then I need to disseminate this knowledge and salted sentence now you after IMEI tools by which I can browse the street that within an hourhusband viewed by 300 people on the one hand I don't want to castigate social media as the great even so they are wonderful social media users can access the happened happened but of course as you correctly without social media is also a huge trap it if you for that bullying and your growing up as a teenager was bad because they were for kids who you hate is in High Schoolword for melting you were now what happens when instead of focusing the formatting you vinayakudu cyber-bullying where 40,000 people can be bullying you won't be put a picture of you when his brother was a young person is not have the thickness of the same to which span and a FAQ for scrutiny from 40,000 people that rather than a big brothereven someone like me who can usually cannot go like this problem is not easy because yes 99% of people write things that are required of the positive but the human mind doesn't read the 99% cotton 1% of the people who wrote held for things about you who make up is about you are you become the more stuff then I cup about you and there is no way to start it goes viral and and there is sovery very challenging thing to have the right discipline to take the best chicken from social media without succumbing to all of the chart and so what are the things that I struggle with as a parent is how do I modulate how much time my children spend on online and you know as you know all of these actions on their design to be addicted the people who designed these understand marketHindustan park and understand ergonomics and the distance that it's impossible for me to disassociate for my damn iPhone sometimes even my my family was a if if we see you that is falling on your iPhone with a bit upset please don't for having dinner and I do it but it becomes hard to create a delimitation between your free time your family and your social media accountsI hear you I am scared for young generation because as you said I didn't grow at 16 years old with some of the trappings of copper medium this two things I want to highlight again for men evolution theory psychology perspective the first thing is the theory of negative bias is the new spoke of that if there is 99 positive comments your human mind good that one negative comment because some ancestor of yours was always very of the lions and tigers roaming around themnight out OK you know this year and elephants and friendly animals but for that one lion and we like super way that way that concept of negative bias is I believe finds itself after thatsomething for the framing effect which was developed by two to the greatest Psychologist in of the show that the points factory Amos tversky and Daniel kahneman and ended up winning the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in studying decision-making and so what are the many phenomena of the day uncover this article the failure of an example that is Burger is 90% factory for thistension presents at those two statements are isomorphic meaning they are logically exactly the same and yet people will judge the burger differently if I trained as many percent part 3 aur 5 trainer at 10% per Le 5000 recommend this place is due to a v understood but if I give you one frame or the other you have a different impression of the 2what is Principal former and we study the framing effect in the context of mate choice if you want me tell you would you like to go out with this person on a date 7 out of 10 of her friends tension power gen that the father of friend I can also tell you that every frame which is really are a ton of her friends that ensures that those two friendsstencil she is the exact song you are EP 1060 not that people don't come up with the same final desire to go to the person as a function and found that when it comes to make toys women would be much more likely to succumb to the training effect because the negatively friend information do much largerbrain is the cost of making a bad Mein choice is much greater to women than it is to a man with something called parantu investment period every am I going your mind at yes I have the same just at theejaculation they are 250 million spermatozoa has 400 ambulation so with a woman's oven is is much more expensive than a man for the right product already is the thing with the scale to women will have to wear the frustration of caste women have to bear the likelihood of childhood Mota Mota also the reason that has a Mini2 much watches for women that does sperm and therefore we expect women to have a valve much more stringent make for a child that why women are much less interested in increasing in short-term making not that there are some of the earth but much less so than men right precisely because of this Toronto investment different and so we take this principle and argue that when it comes to framing within the meeting market the negatively friendmission as a Neon sign much more and women fighters this demonstrates to the evolution of the negativity bias so let me get this straight guard basically because of our past as stone age people and our habits they are centre of a life was a reproduction process and problem anything process to everything was centred around these two things like you choose a maid and you should ensure your next meal is coming from it wasdon't you use our free summarises the game of life is made up of Two Steps but I just what you want if I can I get my jeans my my jeans and with me at Suburban and that and the game of life is made up of two said first and then suddenly procreate and show in some of my other word not in the percentage of my previous box I forgot about they are $40 billion markthe drive much award producer behaviour there is the reproductive module everything right in a day is the survival module there are two things that you could easily remember we can somebody is there and try to get them write example of the evolution of camouflaging write the fact that some animals involved so that they can perfectly become of this is the evolution ofI don't become someone dinner right on the other hand I just saw your presence is the fact that you are probably prefer to eat something fatty and rich in calories more than something that is low in calories but I am I prefer to see se you might prefer if it moves by poster for those things to rock salary because your ancestors and mine involved in environment of uncertainty and coloured scarcityis really make sure you eat dinner and become someone then right and the other two modules are called the kin selection module right why jump into the river to save create my brother's virus my life for my free brothers what is my brother share and average has half jeans with one another and so even if I were to Die if I do that on the surface of saving my brother is human evolution and capitalism is perfect tense andposter images call reciprocal altruism why would I jumped into the river to save you you and I are not Biology related well the reason I do that is something called reciprocity which is it fracture back to their duo scratch my tomorrow so the idea is that we engage and many forms of reciprocity because of this original final evolution speaking this is quite so if you are our best friendsremember your birthday and invite you for that on your birthday but then when it's my birthday you can ask for get a new battery certificate form in Economics there is no reason for this virtual and $50 for your dinner dinnerI can't I can't imagine what you went through after college and after studying these truths about life because according to me if you take the case of an entrepreneur going out on a date it captures all these four ideas IV module is in place in his professional life was doing some work to get something in return the third one is where is doing it was co-founders of something for his family the second one every Pada he sees a pretty girl on the date and then His holy stone a guy gets turned onand the first one is the food we eat at the date so every everything you go through in a human experience that an outcome of what your ancestors went to in your stone it is a very fascinating and this is why important for the excited in my life because at that the children so keep these wonderful Wizard phenomenon that we didn't quite upset a lot in my brother my profession in my life because as you may know if you followmy world there is a huge list of those who just five evolutionary psychology and is thus positive psychology for all the wrong reasons right so Rahte 47 is the spider verse psychology because they don't like the idea that they might be biological based sex differences are with you want pigeon know the right but they are you that men and women are indistinguishable only source of structureif only with the head and the Rahul in the name that would have developed but notyou that of Social Sciences and Humanities professors who hate the idea that humans are biological believe they accept that explains the behaviour of the dawn of the time of the zebra of the mosquito a don't you dare say but it and that evolution explains the human mind what are you some cannot be overridden what is the human mind comes from a magical things to be so there is also the people who aremany many bro Boss against the spread of biological thinking in the Social Sciences also visit my scientific all about is to introduce evolution and thinking in the behaviour of science in general but in the business one particular how to do study consumers without studying Biology how to do study employees and employers managers traders your pic are hormones affect RBIyou can ask me to make a decision before lunch and add on my god sugar is low and even as the exact in the season after lunch what I am not Asian enamel come to defend the Sajan you don't think that affect my behaviour but yet we have hundreds of series of economics and Sociology and marketing that are all outside of Biology at right side of your my world is to save no of course not understand the biological role of who we areyeah I mean after evolution Re psychology is another state of psychology that focuses on different countries like people from different races you like other actually differentiators in Race weather on a physical level or psychological level and evolutionary psychology explain human Universal things that make the Indian Consumer the Lebanese consumer and the Boliviasimilar to one another but it also explains differences between consumers for people in general there are some things that are universal irrespective of culture they are some things that are totally different because of biology and there are other things a totally different not do to Biology the fact that the colour green my be considered to be a symbol of fertility 1000symbol of disease and other might be related to Biology give you an example of a cross-cultural differences that is 2 Biology ok take for example the use of spices in culinary tradition so on average Indian food is spicy year then Swedish put yes now if I were a cultural anthropologist I would simply revel in having made that statement and it would end therespicy food Indian people eat spicy food available within and evolution no no that I want to know is there a phenomenon that explain why Indian people eat spicy food and Swedish people and so there is a field called devilian gastronomy that actually its plane the distribution of Spice shoes around the world and the explanation is meinbeautiful it turns out that spices are used as a solution to something called an antimicrobial hypothesis in half climate there is a grade A proliferation of pathogens foodborne pathogens therefore should in culinary tradition like the use of spices like pickling like solving like smoking our cultural solution to biologyeven in India UC differences in Spice used in Northern India where is colder there would be as much use of spices then inserted in the where it is much harder for them and be greater density of foodborne pathogens in this case you using evolutionary theory to explain differences between groups through the evolutionary psychology is only about studyUniversal spacecraft for the fishes ok like we're coming to the end of the podcasts and have a couple of key questions for you the first is just if someone wants to go deeper into the subjects like psychology like evolutionary psychology like cultural psychology could you give like 5 book recommendations will help you a lot less so of course I would say anybody who wants to learn about evolution psychology readMars in Delhi and Mughal since book homicide Detective Academy in social psychology and other but that's a bit more technical is a classic in the Bible is called the adapted mine was a book that was anything but from 1992 that has some of the big origin of pioneers of social psychology all in one book if you want a book that specific about the Revolutionary route of human making they will busacid work menus Gopal the evolution of desire for some of the box if you are interested in psychology of decision making with was in a wide range of training in my mind after restart by Amos tversky and Daniel kahneman Daniel kahneman wrote a book about 6-7 usable thinking fast and slow about system warning system to setting antacid Word 2007 the boxyou must read ok and one final question for you guys like from all of your life learnings if you were dying today and you had to give the current generation three pieces of learning to carry into the future from all your learnings of life what would it be always support freedom of speech everything Falls from freedom of speech you don't haveif you don't have freedom of speech of enquiry so this and that principal above all others live a purposeful and meaningful life life is very short for on this planet for a very short time period with love the centre Jyada Mota let your work and your registry and your children be your factory mortality and thirdly study things I learnt through the wisdom of wife is be happyEnemies life is magical there's so much exciting things will go through difficult areas my background is item from the horrors of the Lebanese civil war and yet I wake up every morning Stanford And Alive so live life to the fullest don't regret anything and move forward every single podcast teaches me something about the subject that was speaking about but also from the person and from you have learnt about the happen is that you can take away from keeping your curiosity andabout the subject that were speaking about but also from the position and from you have learnt about the happen is that you can take away from keeping your curiosity and your willingness to learn alive thank you brother God bless you giving a lot to the world and I'm glad I could take your story to my country and my audience thank you brother to be with you and keep you"

and start writing them closely and and then see how it goes with the basic rule in all of thisnever put yourself in a situation where you can blow out a lot of money risk of being conservative and risk is the only real way to make money in life that whole I will hit the park and it works for one of a million person but then I know it's very tough to be the one of its not everyone can you can really is this stupid amount of block required to be that oneyou said something interesting and this forces me to Digras available from the world of Finance what is your opinion on MBA is in 2020 in engineering student basically in your coworker and I still see the engine alive in you win like the way you think and all that dude for like again a 24 year old who is figuring ok dude should I do MBA

to educationAmin good network it's how to present how to sell stuff that I don't know if it's coming back to your100 what do you think the world of financial look like will be similar to what we are doing right now but just more advanced what do you think the future simulation of the world of finances just now finished Sapiens changing from todayI think wale world changing I don't know if anyone can really played it that this whole thing around Artificial Intelligence and I don't know what 2050 will be right because in our human kind of whatever tens of thousands of you are yours right where nothing happened really right and then you have this capitalism which took over the world in in the 19thcentury century which is the world is evolving so fast in the last fifteen hundred years what is working for you 5 years bhaiya you know you is redundant today so I don't wanna know I like a lot of people ask me what is your five year plan for Psoriasis I don't know what can happen tomorrow morning because it wasn't so fast I just changed and I think I think what is world needspeople who can adapt quickly and in the end I think the two way to adapt quickly is is to remain Lene if your business can also have I am also that I want to know all this technical types of sorts what happens if we become stuff to maneuver as a business and even as an individual writing the constant effort for everyone has to be just keep learning about whatever new is happening because that's what is horribleworld without even realising about it and so it's tough to say I will find a way to keep the planet on the planetback to the present day selfish question because it's not everyday that you get access to Nithin Kamath now for someone who is not really interested in the world of finance and for someone Europe save who is working in a Startup so busy thinking about the startup that they can't really think ok I want to step in the world stock markets would you suggest a Portfolio Management Service firm as a good option and what your general opinion on PMS formAsin that generally online whenever influences speak about Portfolio Management Services the stock market nodal come on the head don't do this wrong you're making a mistake so what your opinionyou can help you find a mutual fund manager of fund portfolio manager admin if there is no time in everything you should I should just takewhy is the behaviour so different and also which is you buy refrigerator you putting so much Research and effort why not for a new putting your life saving the state is very weird and I don't know what is the reason behind it but most people believe that it in Wi-Fi right now tell you to buy a stock you might Actually by lots of that happening is quite high without really doing any kind of research but if I tell you know what you should buy this refrigeratorresearch for buying it I think I am from that I think what India needs right now which is missing and are the reasons for us so successful is because it isadvisor doesn't make any money from the manufacturer as for example if I sell your mutual fund advisor I don't make any money for the man that I was making a visualforce I can charge an advisory fees a distributor on from the manufacturer but he doesn't do anything for me as a conflict of interest right because if I am distributing to you all distribute what is gonna make me more money than what is better for you I will I knowGoogle pay me a fees only if I make a someone write the US the way to go to the last 30 40 years is all grown of profession advisory system in India is always true distributor in a bank manager is selling insurance mutual fund sure some other guys distributing in all of these are doing it because I have revenue targets write an intermediary just telling you some something in the reason that is measured in India is thatJohn like to pay an advisor fees that because you are like hundred thousand rupees from the manufacturer has no problem because you don't see it going for me it's almost created professional investors the last 40 years advisor talking to each otheronce in The Monk quarter I keep telling you what is the right strategy is it so they know you'll automatically become better as a person right now you'll understand more about the market and have people are so much more professional when it comes to money them then this financially educated world so I mean thanks for the finemuch more financially educated just after this podcast man but I also strongly feel that I am not talking about wealth of being rich but the obvious thought is having a great financial safetynet sets you up for a happier future and keeping in mind that honestly why the world of personal finances exist in the first place because why do we exist as human beings its to have that littlelady of peace throughout your life you know that ok if my family is going to something about the money to take care with my kid wants to study abroad after got you know that ability to do that which is my question to you now dude ok the way you work 1000 youwecan the stock market you got to know about the world of Finance the world of podcasting allow you to Deep dive into people's Minds ok and even I have conversationsI can tell a lot about the person speaking to someone who got like a lot of peace men like this too much peace just in in like a thought process do you meditate is this something from your childhood is it because you you found your purpose in life what what happening in your own head as a Gai I think I think it's more doing something that you love doing nothingthat's the knowledge that purpose and find the purpose is probably the most important side to this place for violet or deny I not forget this much money in my bank I will be very happy that I think it's not about money for sure you know that I was me when I was young I like this Rupee goal in mind and other if this much rupee goal and quit everything going by the fact that what I getwaking up everyday having a purpose of saying this is what I want to do and and knowing that I am creating some kind of Empires there in knowing that everyday I am working hard in the world of investing in India is getting better in some form and this is the same but the bigtrading in which is it is very weird Assassin alot of people are in a trading for a living is one of the top 10 things to do in a putting food on the table trading activity and learning of said earlier I just being so I realise that that's the only way to survive as a trader if I am impulse buy make side table I am in fact everything you know if I do it is no way I can survive the walletin summer we know that having created for 10-12 used before studying the writing is not all the learning from trading and also come into building business personally I never cared about what is not in my control is in only worry about it usually I am trying to always factor in the maximum I can lose at any point of time and I tried to make peace with n and one side make peace with itto make peace with your work is outcome in life everything else seems like thisif you know your heart pumping blood first it your thinking capacity reduces your your shop is when you are the calmest and can also and that I've realised that works and what works for everyone but personally just at any time does an issue crisis when thing like you just know factor in the worst is outcome make peace with that then you are come to just go and find out sothis this this this learning from because I know I traded for such a long period of time the way I look at it I feel like you've found your purpose which is kind of creating things within the stock market understanding the stock market at the same time we understand your shit I've Gotta Be store I gotta be come there for you become an adaptive server not become the best version of yourself in order to achieve your purpose and has a rubbed off on the rest of your life sodude I gotta ask you a little bit about your personal life because like what what impact does all this knowledge and you know this stimulation to get from the financial world what does it have on your family life and what your family life like is my brother my wife my skate my son my phoyostate together and never worksnear my brother Nikhil today manages a hedge fund managers the risk management is so so you done completely different things in the sense of you never have to win every Tok wordpress install Face what I am doing is growing the business building the business broking business is very different to what he is doing and and at home makes it a way that hardly ever talked of money business and in your that because I personally thinkjust family time should be just family time around I don't know if making business really works well what do you do when those little financial numbers and live stock market theories about up in your head at home that how do you blocked them out and then think of cricket available on that you that it's acceptable as a problem when I left him and I slept peacefully in her that I have a Google keep doing rightrandom times in the middle of the not getting after taking notesso she's been part of the soul journey the last 3 years realise the reason whatever I am today is because of the way I was not about business and stock market tradingstart treating a marriage Lekar startup is that if that is true and my my honest question to you man is if your wife stayed with you from Call Centre to now what were your upside down the how did you navigate through itproblem problem but so what happened between she joined become a cabin crew is used a hostess for violin and then for violin Singapore Airlines for 5 years so we know we also had a k 56 year long distance relationship between so we have previously gone to everything and so today she is a fitness freaks vmix-new worker at least one and half hours a day and that's really really bonding time once work once business start it just doesn't just continuous work and I think this whole post covid world has made it even more was given another thing is certain that Sapiens book Again which is every time there is something that is changing the world was supposed to give you more time is takendrive from agricultural Revolution to even now it was you that work from home means in your savings time travelling your savings time in are you doing all the stupid meeting 6.0 times insist that much time and is it islike I don't have to win the fight the house in award to find outside right now in the house everydayrelationship can be this way but the way I've gotten through this is by letting your win every single fight in every single argument and also dude with entrepreneurs again one more colours is that your perpetually in this growth do you know like for example when you are talking about stocks as a learning platform like over the world and life true stock Yog years has Patra live in learning and show that what you doing to businessnow is it true that your partner kind of needs to match up to you in terms of growth was like there it ok if they don't grow in the same domain your growing but the growing in the underlying asset is big In fitness so does that define the exact opposite whatever she likes and fitness query result as a process in order liking Shoaib innoweave never we can never sit and watch a movie together cause I don't likeI process the like what I was so that is there is no in over almost almost opposite in a way so I don't I don't know one thing that works every relationship is different and because I think she is just as well with me in me being constantly distracted and this is whole Rush of wanting to constantly keep doing somethingwhich is the problem if you think about it in a relationship that if your partner is not giving you 100% attention and I will be having a dinner I am thinking or some some business idea why doesn't it just doesn't stop to brain doesn't stop working and that is another problem with it a lot of My Autograph Francis write a constantly thinking about growing a business with knowing is knowing about money and successmoney no money no difference do you knowhow do I do something impactful starts out side perspective you really blessed Gai man like you found your vibral aeolian life you kept at it this definitely think that you have done right in terms of keeping your learning active your hard work active displaying your request super humble guy but do you ever considered that aspect of things that you have a sense of God you have a sense of blessingcloud upon you and you think about that kind of stuff no I don't believe believe in god until you think I am a big believer in the soul good thing that you do it now and I don't I don't really for really think going to temple exercises think now but I am constantly trying to help every single person I can and I am doing it may be a little bit of self-interest OLXknowing that you just just doing that is like a super spiritual things do like that through your actions your life changing the world is in my thing that there is one god to last questions the first question is what is the best and worst aspect of your life right nowso the versus justice is constant in are not being able to set my mind because I struggled to leave I know I am so I am a jack of all trades are allowed a play music app play all Ten Sports schedule thing and I love all of that I can't give time to it even though I can is very very depressing5 minutes more money in my life would be doing a lot of things which I can do but I am not able to do which is which doesn't really bored well the best thing is the soul satisfaction just just being that content in life doesn't does Xtreme of containment was and I can I don't think I was a while and then it's just then you realise itin addition me integrators in him and I don't know you can really get there without doing it in a SIM like a lot of which 4 are saying that know what money is not important in your saying after making money right is its different things to say when you can you done everything and and saying it without doing anything but I think I think this whole being that would enjoy most my life is just so contentmentthe the last question is if if someone you know strip you down to clear all your Assets and you're left with 0 rupees what would be your like strategy over the next year and have it with all your knowledge as you gain the skills you gained all this know how was on just to carry all your money what would you do is write an intellectually right are the reason that grow in my life is attempted a lot of thingsso I've learnt to three musical instruments are played two three lines of sports I've done fitness certification courses in asean have I play poker aur Mausami professionally I know I've learn magic tricks at 16 the phonetic spelling is the most important skill to have I am I don't enjoy selling in person but I really enjoyed doing it not behind the scenes from the phone on on onlaw since it becomes a thing will help us to restart this whole thing and the first thing that I'd probably do is used in a time like this if tomorrow morning I didn't have anything I will probably teach people stock market there are people on stock market in managing money well because I don't think there are too many people were teaching it to be done the right waybeautiful I think you should do like the kind of impact would create with that would just be like something country hasn't seen is there any last you know book recommendations / movie recommendations would like to leave the youth of the country with writers are you listen this is what help me man read this earlier live well as finance or just life in general what your final recommendations of the youth I think books if you are thinking oftrading amorphous market wizards by jack bauer another is a bunch of interviews with almost very similar to have enough people watch pot Kas suggest for event mate 20 of the best traders in the world in interview search is brilliant so if anyone wants to start trading at in nature place to get started on life itself the last book I've read this few times now Sapiens by and this is a smileevolution of humankind and I know you just another realise how like this world is evolved over the last five 10000-15000 years and four people were thinking of starting up a man like a Sarai to the start I think before you start of this is that you think I'd say first Google core competency find a job in an industry which is doing something very similar to whatyour ideas then ask the same question after spending the time to are you still passionate about the original Idea and if your I think India is probably the next Big superpower the world and I think if there is any place in the world where people should be starting business asset India opportunities if you if you find that your lunch with their needsgood business in this country only way we will create employment completely and the some take away from my life which I think selfie significant like a set want to focus about money money is a is an outcome you know if it's not really can't be the goal of sorts the goal has to be just another building right processes be around people do good things andof Reflux miles in Newtons I have to be selfish with you a little bit man because you got such a wide view of all the industry's specifically speaking about India what do you think is the future of my industry which is content like and how is it received on the outside because honestly what I hear is the media entrepreneurs tend to be a little bit when a little bit kind of again for lack of a better word self obsessed you know very likeLatvia whatever but what do you see is the future of this industry on social media content digital stuff I was never on social media for a long time in your Facebook account and I was with family and friends and I got on Twitter actively a few months by and and other reason was with writing this whole Rashi presence of God that such a powerful media has has got belt that I forgot thatsocial media is right place to go into it that I don't think people reading newspapers and and

passion is to be combined with determination and perseverance so the word is great and I think it is very important because if I have passion and doing something in If I don't have the perseverance I don't do well and I know every person goes through failures if I had the determination perceive result try again but if I don't have I just give it up so it is very important to succeed in lifeAaj my wala so great having you on the Ranveer show your message business ideas for a lot of young entrepreneurs in this country I have to very impactful and almost root questions to ask you to begin the first question is this season 9 aur 10 coconut grovein India actor use make parachute coconut oil I don't remember the exact number but we use a substantial number of coconut in India at 9 out of 10 may be an exaggeration but a substantial part of our requirement with the biggest coconut buyers outside in the world and we consume use constitution in crore route se every single Indian at least that I know ofduring my lifetime and use parachute coconut oil at some point 1 out of 3 Indians use parachute so that it still shows that mother I we sell something like a between India and Bangladesh and Middle East peace sell something like every month we sell 5 crore container on bottles every month wow it's every produces when you are starting out in the seventies the early seventies you inherited a small business from your family and Avinash skitsUnited business was very small at that time was mainly the edible oil business was mainly selling edible oils to in unbranded form right to industries in bulk barrels in batane which again so lose to the consumers and I basically converted that businesswoman branded branded you you you to call of using plastic bottle making and eating a lot of young second handintraday trading today weather Singh what were the parents to grow it into what you done so it is straight question now and this is something a lot of young people want to know say after you become a billionaire you after you've reached to what the world calls you make of you is that what does life become like them from now on yours meaning of the time I became a billionaire how do you feel very good I really feel on top of the worldI am a fitness freak so I exercise everyday and I keep myself very fit and this in the pandemic and spending more time on it so I I am I am feeling very good money beyond point does not impact me and I am not can a person who leads the flashy lifestyle so the little the simple Lifestyle so the so-called wealth is not impacted mepersonally or in terms of life till I die don't think I'll ever won a plane or other big bungalow in thing that you know I am comfortable with what I have to keep that gives me much more grounded humble and also I would say that I am for more happier because news artificial so-called stimulants mein call it was so called in positions that to happinessbe happy internally at the Moon position to have a likely the most offering a profound and then you are wanting next next what do you know that in my case the next Kamali you know but what is it like roaming in those circles like when you see people around you may not think the YouTube reach that same level in the Carriers that everyone thinks that we not this is not a different at each person is built differently for some people they want to enjoy spendingresources it's their own Lifestyle or the spending I am not saying I am I have my life challenge not improve it has improved vs Mamata wealth is important to leader comfortable life cell but it is then go beyond a certain point you know and it doesn't impact whether I am 100 x + in from the well from when I talk to you even now at a very busy person you know you have the choice of not being busy so why do you choose to be busy even now I am the kind of personit's like to keep oneself occupied no I have I need to be mentally occupied and I motivation is not necessarily but I have to be mentally occupied I cannot just sit without doing anything sometimes I have to I think I will learn to just relax no I can't breathe out of doing nothing this is difficult for me to do that but I am trying to Soul pandemic also has taught me to be far more patient memory patient is a personso I need to create my own work so it's not necessarily that it is related to business whether it's fitness whether it is whatever I play golf or I have to keep myself busy right in your leisure activities have some amount of growth and then I feel I ultimately life is learning no life is doing new things right and learning from mistakes and taking some rest then experimenting and so it is important to experimentinterferon so I need to get to failure your story all that but I have one burning question in my head which is that while you have the blessing of career success material success wealth and he was a blessing of humility Where are not really taking all the artificial places but what is the Curse of your life because no human has a perfect table and from the outside people see successful people think that ok wearing perfectI don't know I am very very difficult to pinpoint I am I very good health have good family I have two grandchildren which are my biggest source of joy and luckily they just stay one floor below me so I beat them everyday I enjoy playing Golf Golf now two to three times a week I have a good friend circle good social circle salt in all its durable lucky thatfortunate that I am blessed with all the positives you know you ever having negative days even now your system frustrating days when things don't come out as the end in a business there are failure there are some setbacks times I will not be given which is good to put you back but something which is supposed to happen for example a new product you may have launched be not do as well as you thought on you service in Korea which may not do that well but I nothing your checking with more I would say this is astation Rajan big chest right points with your family and your grandparents good pass on only one piece of advice to the mother of all the pieces of advice while I know the hypothetical scenario what will be the one piece be two things out se one piece is difficult ones to watch his person is born with certain inherent god-given gifts and most of us don't know what are our god-given gifts and we try to emulate somebody has becomethat's the fashion like no ok I have to emulate somebody else my my grandfather falling apart I am talking Michael and they need not you know they have to figure out what their god-given gifts and how can deliver it to know and to find out first is to find out what their god-given left and many of us don't know and the process of finding out is actually talking to the other people your family or friends and they will tell you are like this in your very good at this if you pursue career which is based on your gifts the chances of yourenjoying the journey is much more than doing something which you can enjoy in the chances of success of your Hire Services redmi 5S tense level justice and have 75 25% rule 75% of my strengths I will Ryan work on my chance improving my strengths and 25% I will try and nullify my weaknesses normally it is opposite every person tries to save where am I we can I tonight to try to improve what if you work on your strengthchoose some location which is based on their chances of success and much much more than enough for some fatal flaws in terms of their weaknesses then of course you need to rectify them as early as possible but that's one number to another thing every person is a passion is important because passion is a point but passion is to be combined with determination and perseverance so the word is great and I think it is very important because if I have passion andsomething in If you don't have a perseverance I don't do well and I never person goes to failures if I had the determination process even as I'll try again but if I don't have I just give it up so it is very important to succeed in life so with what you doing and marico technically of competing with some very big international players and you have done that throughout your life so what is the Indian mentality that you brought in which has dominated the market like how is Indian Company can do beton those intern56241 is the sirna and believe that Indians can also the pride of being in Indian Indian FMCG company in in in the sector where Lord multinationals are active now in many Indian companies have actually are doing well but you have more multinational than if you look at the overall market for FMCG a substantial part of it would be dominated by multinational so that pride of creating somethingIndian was something always in my mind driving factor 11 the prime factors and then using certain categories and in which are the multinational not directive to the portfolio choice of business is very can succeed did very important role and in some categories of business we are in and where we are market leaders is multinational the not present so the fact that they were not leveraging those opportunitiesand we were able to do so I think that made a succeed in the market that I read about a lot of navigate from your life and how we were young brush person in the seventies and evolved into something as the 80 something as the nineties so the question I have used how have you changed through the decades we would take me to is that it and how is the nature of business in India change so I had changed a lot has changed a lot from the time I started I started off with the very outsetnon confident introvert person I will not sure do I think I had a good business mind but I've always been interested in the past I have changed now I am not I don't think I am introvert anymore but a lot of energy came out of my looking within myself you know initial phases what do I need to do how do I make a mark in thinking thinking through reading talking to some peopleso I think you go on thinking you know so many of mine is it is which and together it is Managing the family was a part of a very large joint family know my father of your markle's my 45 my cousins all together in the business how do you navigate to carve out your own and it was one big step then when we started marico how do you build cultural organisation what element in how culture can help in organisation 16 then the portfolio choice atwhat can a product what kind of categories of product you should go into which will help you succeed in the role on innovation invite him whenever we waited to see in a discontinuous impact their innovation is exceeded so how can you create a culture of innovation was again another thing which I wanted to read a lot of a lot because many Indian organisation that time were not paying attention to the culture part and then as we grow we said that what is the role of the organisedis not just for helping shareholders and creating wealth for shareholders the organisation exist for all the stakeholders and all the stakeholders and antonyms whether it is a consumers or employee is your shareholders resources to working with the society and you need to walk that extra mile in ensuring that you are adding value to each stakeholder and if you are able to add value to a stakeholder then there are the measures at work are interconnected it will helpstakeholder purpose journey something which we embarked about 10-15 years back and now being talked about in a lot of Management circle that one has to look at all the stakeholders and not the shareholders I read somewhere that from getting 202 $1000000 about hard work and idea but from se 1 million and beyond is entirely about humans and how you handle emotional equations how you handle psychology would you agree so I think the role of entrepreneur changes in as you growwhen you are at startup stage are you are also going through learning curve and you doing things on your own so everything because the scale is small you are not able to attract talent you are actually doing everything almost all the things you may have some clerical help some help but most of the decisions are taken by you so that the stage when you are doing things as you grow as you right reported about certain stage then you can handle everything on your to start recruiting peoplethen once you start ignoring people that that means you are getting things done from others is a very different than most people don't realise that when you should from doing things to getting things done your role change is substantially because then you are not doing things you are recruiting talent empowering them ensuring they work in a team just alignment in terms of what is going to be older than the your colleagues role and is a very different way of managing business and I find that many entrepreneurdon't shift gears when they changed from doing things to getting things done because if you don't need the right culture if you don't have the right talent if you don't delegate if you don't have power then you will not be able to attract talent if not able to attract good talent then you're not be able to grow because there is a limit to which you can do things on your own and you have to ultimately delegate and empower if you have to grow so that the Second Stage So doing things to getting things doneand when you become much larger you're not even getting things done your influencing others you are influencing large number of people by talking in Big 4 firms in writing about it any more thing that because then your role is to influence not your own it in but inspire influence within organisation journey reinforce some of the initiatives for example if I have to create innovation I have an influence people I can haveinnovation award within the organisation I can have whenever this review taking place I can talk about what is Innovative things you are doing I can write about Innovation and initiated my people to people in the organisation know that innovation is very very important so that's my way of influencing to others that innovation is something I want to take this don't be afraid of failure experiment so that role as the business grows larger is shift from getting things done to influencing othersbig shift in terms of the role of entrepreneur and nothing if you have to grow into a large organisation a successful organisation which sustained over a period of time you are role has to shift at is very important for organisations and entrepreneurs to ensure that and most of the time I've seen that independent Mein very good idea very good business at a small scale but they are just not able to grow because of these issues and most of the problems are with entrepreneur themselves in terms of the shiphow to make the to control focus they don't trust others sometimes there is a risk in Just another some sometimes may go wrong but what is option you can't going go ongoing thing is all your life you know if you want to do that then you'll always be small in terms of scaling up on a very personal level rather than the reinvention tip that you've given would you give any other trip to on 2008 personal human-level like if you want to keep growing your teeth scaling of what you are the people minessay that it's very highly competitive environment you may succeed initially when you have started a business based on whatever reason your succeeded but don't let that success go into head because the matter of time for competition catch up with you so you need to improve upon what I call the right to win so how are you winning in the Marketplace to depending on the kind of business you are in it may be something innovative it could be some pioneering movie donevision Technology you have developed or it could be something service related things which you have done which is making you succeed do you need to work on these things which will keep you Two Steps ahead of competition and unless you are able to do that it's a matter of time others will copy you and you may not be able to detail that is so a perfect you'll just on creating a right to win is very very important for any organisation outsideAllen plays a very important role and at every opportunity entrepreneur should take initiatives to improve the quality of talent which exist within them for example if there is a vacancy what is a resignation or a new position is created you tried to recruit somebody was better than earlier so you are continuously and answering the Talent pool within the organisation and then how do you written good talent is another challenge because ifknown in the job market that you are very good talent then you will become poaching grandfather other organisations and some people will leave so how do you ensure that is just not money which will keep people with you you have to create the right culture you have to give the right challenge to people to grow so culture building challenge growth is something which will keep people with you and not just monitor really because applying them fire in on money as a limited relative cosita slowbut beyond that you have to keep your talent engage in creating right culture they should enjoy working with you should be looking for the next day what will I am not go back to office Ranchi oh my god had to go to work I have seen Bad Boy billionaires on Netflix bad for the new one which is the Reserve at that level is it is it what happens I would saysomething when is in depending on unke se Vijay Mallya to Adoni to as much great but it was more stubbornness to go into a airline business headstrong aheadstrong I have to be an airline and I will succeed and not willing to listen to others and I think you existed that business much earlier and required that the Deccan air also I should not a dance form so I would say that headstrong in terms of wanting to get into business which became bikeand not existing out the business if you existed you should have been with all other businesses like his liquor in all that still continued to well but because it took so much and that wishful thinking know that things will improve you can't run a business on which you think you have to run it on on actual data data you are able to judge future what will happen to the industry and Vijay Mallya that was the key thing and then I think his Lifestyle also was done doing now becauseshould have actually if the company or not doing well and from what I saw in the episode was that I had a big party for the 50th birthday or something that creates a very long signal you know when you are not paid your employees of course not refunded is party from their line money but people still associate the ki promoter you know that if you can spend money on such big for his party why can't it be that money put in that money in the company and their so I would say thisshooting in some other cases it was more to do with governance and just being Crook so some other Diamond eyes and all that it was just cheating office so is a combination of bad judgement not willing to accept your mistakes governance is very important and it governance is relevant for at every stage in the organisation and not necessary when your big because if you start taking shortcuts it'll come back come back to you know if you start taking shortcuts if you don't follow the rulesit will hit you and when it hits you it just put put you back you know it's very important to you have the right governance to attract good talent and just to ensure that you know you sometimes it it could lead to some delay as it could lead to some extra work but it really worth it through the organisation how much you say like I know you also have a sense of God and your home spiritplay any role in your business career so I would say that to some extent the culture of the organisation is given from my internal leadership style because I was the one who so very open very transparent very trusting willing to take this is something which I've always again a self-starter I want people who are motivated from within so that burning desire to succeedthere is a person comes in and you know I want to be pampered aur I want to be guided at every stage does not as I have nobody guided me in my journey I have taken all my decisions were burning on my own so that the culture which is I mean when I saw that people saying that you are not a nurturing organisational it just I am just realise that ok all of it may have come for me but is there any signs of spirituality within youeven now so I believe I am I don't go temples ok so I don't but I have a strong believe that there is some super force and your to do the things in the right manner that play a role in business of aerobic and income the governors in terms of fairness in terms of ethics it plays a very important role so you have to be very ethical you are to be very fair and you are to do this thing in the right manner and luckily in my sector the kind of business we are in ironthe government for in licence for anything known in at that time of you when I started the visitors use licence Raj and law entrepreneur is benefited by just getting licence thank God and to do because I am not cut out for this reason the no that's not me so not I would like to go and no sell something to somebody as a running a business that have I cannot pamper you and that's not me at all I can do business I went into Din require all this Nahin that help me alsofather 2020 is in 2013 as what business advisor of a youth of the nation in terms of industry we should look at others how we should look about things so I think there are I want is because a pandemic there are you job opportunities which are come up of course it's a big big area of stress anxiety for all of us and we are going through a something which we have never imagine we would go through but having said that it's a matter of time things will improve I don't know when will that happened but I reckon within six months to 1will come back to normal and we are seeing use opportunities created by the penmetsa like like like for example some jio political realignments not between China and other parts of the world like the whole just on hygiene in a people are far more hygiene driven on health weather is mental health spiritual health or the food you eat on immunity you know you want to be far more immune you want to take steps weather is vitamins or ayurvedic products or honey watersuperfoods so and then the whole exposure to digital learning in digital exposure to whether it is e-commerce sorry learning for the kids or a prescription zora consultation with the doctors habits we are formed in the last eight nine months I could never imagine working from home I'm not going to office for 7-8 months and I am perfectly I think I am wondering what do I need to go out of that there is a benefit of meeting peopleinteract with them that I am not undermining that but a lot of times I would not feel guilty that in a fire to call people to my to my office from somewhere from far away and I would make them wait for half an hour meeting they would wish to enough hours in a city like Mumbai to one of our community type which way in future as well as true because I've got so used to it and they also got used to it I don't need to call people for interview if I am going to from Delhi VolvoI can do to zoom call so I think we have a lot of things which which were existing have accelerated and I think they've grown up all of your opportunities in that it will look at that we should look at those opportunities in addition to that I think for any entrepreneurs you have to others here you have to identify a right to when you know so you do something which is unique you don't try and do something which is others are doing it because it is it is growing you will not be able to succeed ifto product you have to ask something unique to try to find out your initials you should try and never Justin if I am not good at Technology no point in me going into a highly Technology intensive business I have to look at what I am good at and fine and define opportunities in areas which I am good at like what do you think about the concept of just human life coming to an end you know I want the very first levelthink about things like that after having such an intense journey as you grow your thoughts change this a first 25 years are for learning stock valued at 25 next 25 years the for earning in the next 25 years after giving you know so your desire to give back as you grow increased substantially and depending on what you can give you can give time we can give energy you can give money in my case I woulddo all three together because I can afford to give money but it's just not giving a donation to hospital for school on the I want to be act I believe in active giving you have to be mentally and what I should spend time on something which I am giving and not just donating money to an institute of something but each person as you would be so I am I am increasing spending more time on my giving initiatives what can I do to make a difference to this world I think that gives youother type of joy and they say and I was just of humans to Alim Premji saying he gives it does not giving giving is more difficult than than earning and running a business you need to decide to give our whatever you're giving is it making an impact so it's a challenge you know if you want to do active giving in terms of ensuring that you are making an impact and do you have any regret for not being born in the 90s and 2000s begin until now you happyI don't think I am I am quite practical as a person so I was born in the second time I've enjoyed that part I have creative business Om but what do 90 is born kids have that your generation didn't I think they are far more freedom for more independent they are far more conscious of environment and you knowwhat is going the future they have this purpose within the organisation is very important that I have advanced level I see that good kids coming from families I think they are I like the good qualities in them of course I am in the bad kids they would do drugs or something that's but I am talking on the positive side is not well lot of kids they have I think they understand much more the global issues which would impact all firstand it could impact them more because of the environment issues sustainable issues will get accelerator driver period time and it would be within their lives tell me didn't think about it as much nowadays no but in terms of business opportunity what do we have like in terms of this new India that got the internet that way more educated so I think you scenes from the unicorns coming up in the last few years now so I think there are enough opportunities are having the option Teresa and area of Technology know how can Technology impact onin India has huge opportunities whether it's agriculture or whether its environment or education for Healthcare can you try and leverage technology to improve the age of agriculture or to what Telecom did to through mobile to reach so many people to in Healthcare education there are you seen the likes of byju's and in many other learning companies they have really goes so well in the last few years now so there are enough opportunitiesand everyone should look at the positive side beautiful before signing of your coming out of the book soon yet I am excited about because while researching this interview I couldn't find the quantity of information I wanted on your reference to any stories and morals you had I think that's what I realise when I stepped down as managing director of the company and in my speaker lot at various events on average at least twice a month and whenever I spoke aboutJohny aur any topic which normally speak on innovation or board management or more in journey or how do you create a culture of innovation how do you convert a family manage complaint to professionally managed company are used to get lost suggestions by into when your thoughts and write a book so when I had that time I say that ok let me let me try and do that and as you are that said only to you I cannot remain on occupied I have to do something so thatwriting a book and it's almost like almost over and I it should go to the populations Within by latest by November in and it should be released by 8 march I have a kothabur is also my mentor and I want to win every I've had issues I have spoken to him is professor Ram Charan is very famous quotes internationally is written some like 2527 books in many of them were sold Millionsin the copy some very fortunate to have him but the most of the writing I have done and he's given his insights into the book sweet captures all my journey from the time I started to till today and all my failures what are the learning of these failures at his come out well I am quite happy with the weights turning out and other name of the book is Harsh reality so now in the final stages of another some shoots on cover and let but it's a matter ofI hope that by March April when we are ready to release things are much more back to normal and people start going to book shops in and see the book and then we can also hold panel discussions and in a more power is so so I am I am looking forward to releasing this book can you know getting feedback about the book but I am quite sure that it will help entrepreneurs it is give basically it is argued to entrepreneurs want to scale up for entrepreneursfamily businesses for professionals who want to improve the function is so there is a lot on culture building how do you have an effective board of directors so I think there is for all professional as well as to when you are there is there is a lot of learning in this book I think it might be more valuable than modern MBA is especially from especially considering that I am does a Commerce graduate I am not studied in thing for the but I have worked with hundred MB a lot from them soI think its practical knowledge and I think that makes a much larger impact than just theory thank you would like to give this point so all I can say this to will pass never waste a crisis is a crisis all of us are inprices all of us are in in the crisis all of a sudden different boards some of the better of some of us are not better off but I all I can say this to bill pass and look at the positive side are going for many thank you really appreciate

lot of the aspects of the spot beginning with my favourite aspect of sports stories stories of triumph stories of victory Wagon talk about three legendary basketball playerspost polio is my biggest Idol at this point in my life of spoken about a lot on the podcast is name is LeBron James a lot of people consider them to be the greatest basketball player of all time I will tell you why so in Basketball up till the time he came he got into the League in 2003 and right before that that whole phase pre 2003 problem since the time basketball big and was very much a hero bolsport that made that any team that won the Championship would usually win because of a one star player one would be significantly better than the other players and that they would usually take the game Into his own hands and score all the points in order to make his team when you be a score of you be the guy who throws the ball into the basket now in Basketball the points that every time you throw a ball in the basket you get two or three points does assist the personis it to the score of get an assist those of a crucial part of the game and something called rebounds that means of someone tried to attempt scoring and the ball doesn't go inside the net bounces off the rim and fall back into one of the players is hands that player gets rebound is rebounded of the backboard and is given it to the other players in his team now up till LeBron James came in the league the league was based on Hero bol your comesKuchh changes the game he is definitely capable of playing Hero ball is extremely gifted is an absolute beast of a man she was cute he was strong and he was fast but to top it all he valued the team game much more than the individual game he was a very capable of becoming an individual game Legend but he decided Amber be the guy who elevates my entire team he focused on is assess if he came into the league the hero of theonly focus on the points you some will focus on the assise Badi was so good that sometimes the team required him to focus on the point scoring as well if currently third or fourth all time in terms of scoring reason for high up on the list in terms of assist his a guy who Elevators entire team and when need be 1st and requires him to he goes and scores the points as well as an ideal of Mind today I personally feel that teamworkbuilding the elevation of the people around me is my big golden life mein study LeBron James is leadership mentalities his personal mentality his family life his habits is Fitness routine Inside Out that was the sport basketball give me give me one of my biggest idols of all time is that one guy who firebringer podcast for be start crying before the podcast happened was crime ET after happens I am very emotional about LeBron James to the futurestory you find out that he came up from complete poverty his father had abandoned his mum will momos pregnant with his mum was 16 years old when she gave birth and bottom up as a single mother day basically had a really tough life he was supported by a basketball scout playing on the streets this or talent and M and n groom them to become a really good basketball player but because of the person hedecided I will be the guy who will assist my teammates much more it isn't capable and also score I make my team win lots of leadership lessons that you will learn from this man before we move on to the next player I want to highlight one more aspect of LeBron James outside of basketball he is meant by Warren Buffet and Warren Buffet set the way these guys investing right now he will become richer than even his mind and Warren Buffet is one of the richest man in the world today the bronze is an intelligentteamwork based human being attached to one more gorgeous thing about Basketball it exposes your character the court is so small as only five guys are playing with so based on the way a player plays the game you get to know a lot about them as a human being LeBron James helps his teammates on the basketball court is a kind of man who helps estimate of the basketball court as well his Entourage the people around in his business teampeople who were his Bros when he was 17 18 years old and he had intended the league get is elevated them to become CEO of company is elevated them to become founders of media companies at the kind of man years is fuelled them is given them the contact is given them the finances so that they can be well established arrangement question about this at some point and he said that they you know what I love my brother's but also we are financially securing me if you make your wholeplay well very likely that your team will win the Championship he knows himself by wali self-aware news is that self Awareness to better his game and Elevators teammates and on a side note if 35 years old and is still considered in the MVP conversation of the league legends is the best player in the league it is one of the top two or top 3 best players in the league at the age of 35 most basketballers start declinethe time that 32 33 years old at 35 these guys Rock solid wickets taken care of and service in X disciplined man is displayed when it comes to his own body and is discipline when it comes to the game please keep in mind basketball is one of those games that changes every 10 years he's kept up with the changes he didn't have a three-point shot that was really good three-point shot is when you should outside the UK in Basketball court in gzbSunil stand outside it in you shoot a basket with 3 points he was a good shoot I developed an inside to point short first and when he got hold on this a lot of other players in this League who are getting better the three-point shot he built an insanely good three-point shot acid and many years and it he did this news about 30 years old because he wanted to win the Championship here to beat a certain man called steph curry that the second I want to talk about Basketball changecan use because the players were playing the game steph curry came into the league in 2009 before he came and it was much more about the two point shot booking your way inside the court working your way towards the basket and scoring from near the basket you had to be strong athletic extremely fast be able to do that people could shoot was only five valued but they wouldn't get that many chances to prove that the shot is really gooduser guide who comes in as a point guard was 5 positions on the basketball court the tallest biggest Gai stands on the inside is called as Centre then the two shortest guys are the two Guards the point guard who is kind of more in charge of assisting the available on health is teammates the point guard return of the coach on the court and distributes the ball test emails that the shooting guard whose main responsibilities scoring and as a small forward livePanjim someone who does everything based on their own skills at the good assisting the double of director good score in the do believe that if the good defending the mainly focus on that the rest of the point guard this is called the era of point Guards in the league because right from 2005 a lot of great point guard started entering the league shorter guys were very skilled a very athletic who really strong for the relief fast they would work their way inside the court go near the baskets ko maybe dunkwho is not strong very fast is Agile and changes direction really quick is not the most athletic Gai his biggest weapon was a three-point shot was an extremely accurate three point Shooter people look at steph Curry today and they think it comes naturally hi spoken very often about how he was in high school when he was in college No 1 value them because all the other point Guards his aides were very athletic very strong and use the skinny guyAligarh to shoot was taken to the league in 2009 and Lord people don't respect those game really was not the mark he figured that hold on 3.2 don't get that much opportunity to show the skills that that's ok I am still gonna take that chance in an attempt to shoot more 3-pointers very good 3-point shooting he made it even better after you enter the league and because he got so good at three pointhe made his team when a lot of the games of PC with time I became stronger faster more athletic Badi focused on his own strengths his strength was only the three-point shot shot from far away at all that he made his team win based on a three-point shot his team became so strong with him and his teammate klay Thompson is also an insanely good three point Shooter this together consider the two best shooters of all time today the rest of therealised Om man if you want to beat these guys you will be to build a really good three-point shot LeBron James built his own good three-point shot after steph curry and Lake Homes and entered the league steph curry change the mindset of the entire game everyone side taking more 3-point attempts that would happen even the tallest crisis Centre who stand in the middle of the court he moved to the outside centres a certain 3.2 or today because of steph curryshow that when you are extremely self aware of your strengths and your vision for why you want to take a whole industry we want to take your whole future you got off work on your strengths and trust yourself that I'll be able to do that steph curry huge inspiration of mine is coming up around the time I was thinking of launching devices at once Seema swimming championships his story inspired me because I thought you know what does a guy who everyone doubting he only has one thing I can do well all I could do wasI sighed fitness channel ID of the fittest body the very end of every day fit and guide boy next door to write a good Talker and does not give me my carrier you got trust your strengths you have a vision love you know I want to take things you got trust that vision keep going to know you might be the next step carry the league has entered Ozone day where it's taking more three-point shot than ever before it opened up the court of the game is to be aboutIndian going to the shooting from near the basket now the games become extremely spread out shooting is much more valued to get changed the entire game based on his own strength in the whole League play according to his rules as someone else before Lebron and carry who had made the league play according to his rules was Michael Jordan spoken about the Last Dance his Netflix documentary that out right now and oh my Goddocumentary has been giving me so much fire lately it's about his mentality history what it took us use athletic yes he was gifted but here comes the theory of the first Rang versus II Rang of gifted the first Rang of gifted would be people like Lionel Messi and football Sachin Tendulkar in cricket probably someone like magicin Basketball LeBron James all the falls in that first Rang was born with the physicality and the Talent needed to succeed a lot of people who are born with the raw talent God gifted talent in sports usually don't make it to the top some of them to understand ok bye have been given these abilities that I need to work hard and ensure that I achieve a good career become good but the icons are always the people from that second Rangmean of the most gifted yes they have a skill that they have a few strengths that they may not be the most gifted basketball players or gifted Businessman and like me I am not gifted I'm no good at if you think there's a lot bigger better than me a bridge that gap a bridge that gap through relentless hard work as he watched sports that we watch people like Michael Jordan do that thing self-beliefaccompanied with insanely intense hard work yes we live in a time where Hasil culture is promoted a lot and a lot of people criticize Hasil culture is you shouldn't work so hard you should care about your mental health you'll burn out holder I understand that not everyone is capable of running at lightning speed by Michael Jordan did but it is important to put that message out for those few Michael Jordan's out there is thousand people listen to this podcastrepublic and people would be able to work at the pace of Michael Jordan And speaking all the shit for you 10 people I am one of you 10 people I am just like you are not good at everything I am in that second Rang I am born with a few strands of definitely not the third and fourth Rang I wish I was in the first Rang but I know the end of my career when this whole story is over and we are the top of that first rank based on my hard work that I got from Michael JordanTarzan selected On a High School basketball team but because he was so hungry for success he decided to work so hard that improve every are wrong improve my coach on didn't choose me that's ok I am gonna go to become the greatest basketball player of all time he entered college he was as good as his teammates he worked hard to become even better than them he got drafted into the league had not was not second but heard that ok single-handedly he pulled the city as team upis the breakfast was pretty bad but single-handedly describe one the Rookie of the year so when a new player enters the league there is alot the cal rupees and although they compared against each other that I wanted it to came 7 years to win his first Championship reach the finals he reached the pre final didn't happen kept hitting kept going for it kept working hard finally he won he retired from the basketballbranded baseball came back lost in the following season is hunger came back goes and even then other three championships back to back at the end of his career he 16 Championship his teammates call him crazy his teammates column one of the most intense human beings to ever have on your own team even those guys who you really appreciate on your own team would you kind of hate exit intent with steam if he wanted to bring the best out of them his sidekick scottie pippen help them will also championships he was given thesecond drugs problem III or iv and lots of talent but definitely not a world-class basketball player Michael Jordan Michael Jordan brought the best out of him you sure interviews of Michael Jordan straino talk about Michael Jordan's work ethic and that's when you realise what it takes to actually become legendary is considered the greatest basketball player of all time even more than LeBron James Lebron James is carrier still as another five years ago but Michael Jordan will teach you a lot about whatsymptoms of a mind set not all of us are born in that first Rang most of us are born in that second third fourth Rang everyone to get promoted up do scottie pippen even if you're not a Michael Jordan at least of the juncture of that second and first wrong if you are Michael Jordan ensure that when your story is over when your carrier stories over your considered the greatest of all time the way I described lebrons game and steph curry is gamenot described Michael Jordan's game much because he could do everything and he could do everything Bakrid spent a lot of time learning research in each of the team he was facing researching the best possible ways to become a better basketball player by the way it was in terms of basketball interview with skill set and terms of hard work in terms of your fitness in terms of your mentality he did everything possible because he was obsessed with winning the Championship go watch the mother of king Last Dance you want some motivation in your life you want vertex be successfulwhat's the Last Dance ko study Michael Jordan full of fire full of inspiration just like Basketball this is why what's that support hope you guys enjoyed it is Podcast who believes you with some modifier until next time guys trying John driving available on driving steph curry be a game changer the great teammate be that guy who ends up and at the top of your firsthope you guys enjoyed today's podcast how will leave you with some modifier until next time guys trying John driving a Lebron driving steph curry the game changer the great teammate be that guy who ends up at the end of the top of your first Rang see you guys later

the study person who looks out for you when you love anyone them around all the time it's a beautiful thing like you know and love being in that place but at the same time I feel like it should not be a crush I feel like I've seen people who are in relationships because you know that rather not be alone you need to be like a really strong secure ok with yourself to be able to give yourself fully to another person because you also have that responsibilityyou not like if you are in a relationship it goes works both ways I am in your getting something you're getting the support and emotion because you are also giving at back and that's how it is and that's the beautiful thing about it so it is important that you are really really like strongMr Prateek kuhad thank you for all the memories you created in my head and also thank you for making my heart break first the little more intense and then a lot more healed up as a Going Concern and good how are you thanks for having me here and I feel like I don't knowlove you beerbiceps videos whatever but that's why I am not going to kind of increase the emotion level of this podcast gradually I'm gonna dives dude so would you describe like the most painful heart break of your life in as much detail as possible because I know that kind of played a role maybe not in creating cold mess directly but any kind of song that contains any painremnants of the train of that Heartbreaker present in the songs of what happened mean you know on AC man it's not I I don't know if I can say that any one particular heartbreak was the worst of Bada there and I think the more you can I grow up and so were not different aspects of life and have more diverse experiences we can realise that it's it's like not that simple you know every breaking wave hasdifferent and they been harder in different ways and some of taking longer to get over and you have like you know I think everybody has a bad break up almost any no almost everybody and even if it's not a break up in the traditional sense you know it could be a fight it could be you know temporary split between two people could be between two friends even though is just it is actually all the same sentiment to some degree soI feel about it did so my mum primarily hates my toys and music was a lot of wrap a lot of AC DC style Rock ok but in the lockdown is spent a lot of time with the given in the house clean the cooking with her and always end up listening to some Prateek kuhad music I remember the first time I made her own kind of song Aliveplaylist and that I need for your more of your stuff that got me wondering that dude I feel like you've got this very Peculiar element in a musical am not a dudu knows music very well but you got something very different in you and that's why I also feel that there aren't that many Pratik words out that should do you kind of save your music like that is this something different that you are doing I don't know whether the most sold in it or you really really right from the Deadpure heart I don't know what it is good for you tell me like what do you do that captive Captivate so many people I don't know man I think like a man if I was to be completely honest I think that you know is a combination of things are main you know you be write a good song and you usually work that song can you play a bancha live shows in his body builder fan base and its whole process writing being a professional musician is not just about like a lot of people and Society of artistscreators in general even like such as yourself that it's you know you just make the content please whatever you're making your case it with you in my cases song and you just any just happens but there's a lot of you know stuff that goes behind it which is everything from Lekin putting yourself out there and distributing a properly and you know like only making like a good music video with or just playing and shows whether it'sI think is definitely a bit of that which I have been good with and have like put in a lot of work which cannot create that like perception that like you know that this is such a great song and if it really is a great forgot I don't know but I hope it is but but also it is also a bit of the fact that I do I do write quite honestly and I don't know what the depths of my heart and that that's very hard to say but I definitely like right very subconsciousin the sense that I don't really have a plan when I am writing and all of the song is not something that I decided I am going to write about Heartbreaker today Manu write about this aspect of a relationship between Moradabad and I don't pick a topic and write about the usually just right and something comes up and sometimes and any could be anything you know so I think that the because of that process can a lens a bit of honesty to thethe writing I am doing baby you know the music is what feeling sound like so the words that you choose to use your songs and the instrument used to use is that kind of a reflection of how you view relationships because if that is the case 2 there's a reason that so many people are crazy about your music from love perspective because I feel for a lot of people your songs kind of very good audio version of thecall love u look that at all like that people who feel and I am really great for people feel that and so strongly about it and that's really like one of the best compliments you can get being a songwriter is that somebody gets and it still baffles me sometimes I feel like I barely have artist who do that to me you know I am in AP definitely had artistintegral part of my life but this this this so few thousands of like songs and people you've listened to the fact that I am that person to you know a bunch of people out there is really really cool but yeah and I don't know that how it happened really I mean it's just again I think it's just like it's not it's not intentionalpick up board because of you know it just is very it's very instinctive like writing is very important for me and it comes from like listening to a bancha songs and learning about the songs and adjust the years of like you know the stuff you do to get to a point where you can write in constructor song new Instinct we can get it is a skill so I put in things which I feel are nice does it mean if a word feels nice somewhere I put it in the if you like the Planet of the music and the productis the same as this goes by what feels right for the song in crazy dude because you have like some spiritual practices in your life I know that you have some kind of spiritual based your thought process so we recently had Amish Tripathi writer on the podcast and he spoke about how his art he strongly considered himself to just be a channel through which the universe expresses its owner and a lot ofus across different like jaundice Soviet writing YouTube Ennai Kai second his thought singing also a lot of people consider there are the create two not be their own and given that the kind of look themselves the some kind of a channel just for se spirituality auto inspiration to express itself do you look at your stuff that we like new kind of sometimes consider yourself channel ek do I don't know where this is coming from it is land ofhead out for the world for sure I mean that definitely so many things that every turn and sometimes every now and then you just sit back and you should hurted I like actually write that song because it it hard to like it's not a very like I said and I feel very stupid answering these questions a lot of times because you know that can a question to ask me right before this which was like you know how do you write I get the lord and that I have this idiotic guard services like I just couldn't do it likeprocess scamming people almost but it really like it really is like that I don't know and maybe it is that maybe it is just like I mean I definitely do have a site that believes in spirituality and like energy flows and you know it it it it could be I don't know I mean my mum says that actually something which is I feel I would expect like and in what to say I like this you know this is a God gifted blah blah and a lot as she like how do youI know it's weird like my language skills were actually always pretty bad both and English and Hindi Amin just in terms of this academic year is not that I was an Avid reader or am never at that much poetry in my life I've never like you know as a kid specially I used to hate reading literally I would my parents be like a note with lyrics of watching TV live Pritam books and I would never do that and it just suddenly I was really inspired at a point of my life with youfilms music and that can I spotted this like about a songwriting and the first time I wrote in Hindi also just happened like like that we spontaneously and since then it has become a lot more skill-based because once had happened and I felt like they encouraged is when I feel like I actually started working on it consciously so today I feel like a lot of the stuff I do is planned in the sense that I write a song and a constructorwith a lot of the skills and the craft that have developed over the past so many years was a Fila coronavirus song writing is very spontaneous had no idea what I was doing business Kinder happening and the writing was happening and yeah so I think is a mix of both feel like the moment you get when definitely just kinda like flows really nicely and other day is which when sometimes weeks or months passed and it is don't feel like anything stomach naturally Bruce Lee push yourself when you write a song andgood enough so I just had no good considering the fact that we are such a massive population why on the more Prateek kuhad in India like you know people who came up independently and like and had their own identity for remember for example of this is a very Amazon perspective because I don't understand the music industry well but back in the 90s you know how the devils hole wave Indian pop coming up like individual people making their own kind of music Lucky Ali had of you like crazysong back pain that they cannot died out in the 2012 is adding this remix is old songs and there was no pop for why was under the rise of YouTube does a lot of independent people coming after releasing the music we are you friend call Abhilasha Sinha election all of our staff but yourself Abhilasha and a few other people are the only people who have on social media in the systemthis is completely personally my theory my opinion to answer the question which can I thought about this before because we definitely had a wave of independent music in India within the night is like you said and a massive luckily fine as well by the way in just like all his work from back then Silk route was amazing you know Euphoria the staff is amazing and I like some cool like band back then but I don't the Aryans the Asterisk5 people man and I don't know maybe it was not sustainable for some reason I don't know the back end of that the business model the following worked me I feel like they were all and I might be wrong but I feel like a lot of them were backed by the same Producers and music company is which are part of like you know the commercial music industry even today and nothing wrong with that but I just feel like you know it was in may be voluntary andbrother feel like today the ship that happened in this is not just happen in India 78 cross the world is truly is independent for the first time in oem in the sense that like I can set and Rider song today and produced in my this Studio right here and put it out on Spotify I like next month and that's it and it's this is as simple as that are good for distribution service online and put it out and I can do my own marketingand of course it's at a much smaller scales or may not be able to a phenomenal job of it but I can do it and that was not a reality and that everything that basically internet has made possible so so today I feel like a lot of what is are truly independent in the sense that their livelihood is not dependent on you know anybody with themselves you know they are able to like then comes directly to the fans unite 2 of show and that like literally had a direct channelstory does make you independent Saifi like this time it is a lot more sustainable and this time and hopefully that actually happens is truly an independent way which will continue to be independent of considering the position you kind of created by yourself and eukaryote now when you came back from college when you came back to India like did you are you studying abroad right when you came back to INRdo you have these kind of emissions that ok that's the guy I want to be I want to be once in a while creating some Bollywood music as well as on our really strong independent presence plus I want to do this I wanna be the voice of basically the independent scene in India now did you plan on this out and was a game you played like from the career perspective or did all of it just happen you kept working at yeah it was definitely like I would say it was a organin steps in the sense that like I definitely don't know seven years ago when I started from scratch in India that I would be here today and it's not like today was the day I was planning for but you know you can I like planned for the next one year or a year and a half Mile OK good night bye next year if I can remember like my were my first goalscorer start doing this was likes and back then especially the weekend as a pretty big deal like abhi WhatsApp like you know the musicand so does one of my goals that like you know it I need to play like a really good weekend the slot and then that happened one year later so you know I was a cool and then I was like ok now what so then you like plan for something else which is bigger and you take a challenge yourself on a feeling that had happened to me it just like I wasn't even sure that it would be you know when I started doing what I do Igive myself in you and I was like let's see how it goes because if things are not worked out I would probably like stop doing it and then moved on to something else because I was fully prepared to be doing what would you be doing that I don't know I probably be like and I will eventually got into some form of like entrepreneurship April I walked away for a bit and then gone dance on the my only concern that can a person I am I like being like not222 anybody Rasila ka would eventually gravitate toward that but it could most most likely would have been not music for sure you know I see you're applying a lot of your personal branding and Entrepreneurship Vibes into the brand Prateek kuhad as well do like this little things you do on your social media and all I think that actively thinking of another also Y1 ask you do like as a 14 year old how do you see yourself like what would be a good scenario for you I am not antalking about just carry on dark mode you as a person what do you want no man I feel like this I am I mean I feel like in the past 10 years almost have done so many shift in what I want it is changed so often and that it's really hard to say I mean I definitely know that like I hope I'm still doing what I am doing for sure I mean I love song writing and I want I hope I am putting out like you know really great music eventand don't know speaking about this thing about I hope and creating good of music again them asking 1 a Rookie question why do like so music directors and all not sustain the levels they once created and What happens does a musician run out of creativity that he ran out of inspiration diseases get like kind of board of the proslike what do you think happens when I don't know and you know that what are the questions that scares me because I have seen that happen to a lot of just artists of all kinds acchi not just musician beautiful I will make you see both kind you see some who actually just get better with age and they just keep like knocking out and every time they did you know they might have a DIP and like make like a minivan talk about musicianslike one bad album and their powers back to the next one again and it's just you know and nothing is ever that bad actually everything is great is that one is like you know maybe V album is not as good as their extremely insane third album but you know and the other people would definitely feel like you know something happened you know that did not getting enough of themselves and maybe maybe the get bored maybe they get lazy day with complacency hard to say I do if I do whenyes it would be one of these things I dont think you run out of creativity at least I don't have to believe so I really hope that they know that the ones you can't control fan of creativity that I mean I am not because everything else if it's likely is in a so complacency or anything I can Kintu I can push myself to be a better person but if I just run out of creativity for some reason than that that's does a scary thing so you know I feel like it's it's just peoplehaving different goals I feel like you know that in order to properly reach a certain age and they like this is all I have I want to do I don't want to do this anymore so they move on to doing other things maybe maybe they like you know focusing on their personal life on like something else and another other interest Mall could be anything it's hard to say but I feel like it's more that a conscious decision more often than not dude about creativityI am going to exchange some youtuber versus musician notes so I feel that this whole wave of tension kind of taking over most of youtubers in the social media creators in the country where just people are kind have the same concerns that your having but you are you are talking about that much older age bagula Ke Main Yahan 3540 I hope that alright a lot of the social media people generally kind of look at that in the context of one monthI hope next month and able to like sustained like what I am doing here because I can help to rise really fast can also fall like that fast so a on Social Media ka Hak to sustain creativity is reinvention that what we tell everyone like all the talents managed by monkey all my friends always tell them that would consciously think of real mention in some aspect that could be as simple as using a new camera for video but the otherthing that I feel isn't spoken about enough is that while I think creativity is one of those things that doesn't voluntarily leave you there are things you can do in your real life that kind of the lord your creativity like just being surrounded by the wrong people being surrounded by SM and now we're not just probably even having the wrong habits not having turned off structure of professionalism in your life all that was a kind of helps your creativity fade away so I am sure you will be used for 7 years youspotted like positive pattern few things that help your creativity and probably things that don't you know affect your creativity well and knowing you have seen some of the interviewed undue stress a lot on your professionalism like how you can de do bring that athlete mentality even to what you do in terms of musical I know if something you do this and do a good job to what your positive daily habits which affect your creativity vs The negative ones soNevi Nevi force talk about the whole professional thing which you know I think I'm not sure if it affect the creativity or not to be completely honest that's not the reason I do it the reason I do it is because you know I think essay writing to do you know I minut somebody's watching me if I can I am the can a person who likes doing things well Soi my family making my coffee or like you know cleaning up my room or you know cooking something anything for you not writing a song I wanna do it like thisso if you like things are not happening well I go online and Eli research in Mila Ke how do I make a better coffee and I'll do that so I am I am constantly trying to do than that it's a very person that I just like I get a kick out of it but with something something really nice Gemini Safilguda border that I am fine day like just really motivate me so that that's why DU vi function like that when it comes to creativity Mahanagar be honest I think it's a It'sRabindranath Tagore on myself like it's really weird because and all of the things she said were absolutely on point I think that like surrounding yourself with the right people is really really important and for everything you are not just creativity and and Europe be having healthy habits like being consistent with things all these things are main role to play but I don't know but you know another like and this is this the badsimple and everybody should do this all the time but like for example like I've had you know I really like bad late drunken Nights with random people in OLX 6 new people and it's been a very interesting experience and you could say that that's a really bad things to do in the sense that in of Definitely like binge drinking is bad for you and that may be like staying in a minutes did not like the atomic do everyday because it definitely like damaging not just your physicalbadhiya mental health and emotional health in the long run but I had some very like you know rich experience is true that average expense is travelling but I've also had like really really rich experience is being with my this by myself you know this being Locked Up in a room for like 2 weeks sometimes when I am you know in a new city where I am trying to like you know just like do more work and Odd even in Delhi even have not had worked and adjust in YouTube learn new thingsBest Buy Canada League looking within your sometimes I just like riding a really good book or just like watching like danger watching like 20movies a day which have done something I find it like is overload of information that like suddenly a week later like spur some like new thing so I feel I am but I am still Tana like it is one of the hardest question to answer what you are you know that how do you like keep yourself creative I mean if if I knew that I would do that every singlebut I am really is that does anything put together some time just like I mean you know a lot about love for me that a lot of my songs came from a break up so I need to stay in the others all the time but it's like I'm in a very touchwood Amina really happy relationship right now but I am still writing and reading about other stuff and you know we'll find out if it's good or bad word in every comes out but it's not likethe different thing but I wouldn't say I am a better or worse song writer for that so this is our role to play in your life but at the same time it's it's zero and really confusing really confused about myself it honestly one of those questions that I think about a lot and all of been thinking about for years that how do you maximize your creativity how do you make your own system the most efficient Golden my versionis my version of a from speaking on Towers to singers actors to directors I feel that everyone has this pool inside them I think of it like this couple of creativity that kind of gets a little bit diminished every time you put out some creative work during some water from that pool and putting out for the world ok and rest plus absorbing information kind of refill that pool so when you sleep really well over new binge-watch 20movies agosay what you said about Input information it adds in library feeling that pool now while meditation doesn't directly affect the quantity of water in your creative pool what I do feel meditation does is that it allows you like some other worldly level of focus so even when your pool is like almost empty without litre water will left inside in normal circumstances if you're stressed you do I know I don't have that much wattmain creative pool any more but if you have a meditation habit you are able to exactly take out the amount of water needed to make Red Bull and still carried out so meditation helps you more the stamina India is it like exercise may be for your mind but your creativity something that is only replenished time sleep and all add an obviously like all when we talk about spiritual have it like eating clean all that the speed of water increasing the pool changes that that's my answer toquestion but again the just a hypothesis I don't know if it's like if it's a valid theory but coming coming back to what you said I mean by Amanda was saying that you know I never thought about it the way you thinking about it but I think it's just another way of basically saying that like if you are and and meditation is like a way for you and for me to a certain degree to stay really focused and on top of my like thisscented soy can function better as a human and I think it's just like you just basically talk about discipline you know the harder you work on Your Grave the battery will be so even if you have like that really tiny amount of water left inside you like you said you can still make something out of it if you really are centred overall and how It stays and it is equal to a different Veri nice to find running release entering at a point of time you know I feel I just thinkmix helped me keep a little balance eating right like so everybody has their own ways of doing that but for sure man like I think that is no there is no and this is something that I actually feel like it's really important and it's like it is a perspective that I found very useful for me that even if I have even have this in a reservoir of this is partly Inside Me full complete like you said and if I don't have the requisite skillto convert that into you know something that is like good like in my case a song you know a song if I if I don't like write a song at all then it doesn't matter how much creativity I have it's just it's Never Gonna Get converted but even if I have very little of that creativity left if I have you know put in the work and I am a good songwriter I can still write a tradition song with nothing at all so it's like you know and whenboth that's why I like the magic happens in that would not always happen to you because that's not something you can control but why would you can control is like the discipline behind it so you know I feel like all we should all you can do is do that you just focus on that do not worry about that another way too much then like you define I think also also the keyword you put out a centring in spiritual practice is called grounding it's the same conceptcentring so grounding is basically something that prevents you from overthinking so how are you with chakras like we heard of just how chakras work so grounding again without getting into too many details about Chakra grounding is something related to your lowest chakra and The Curse Of Being an extremely creative person is a lower success always taken up so one way to fix it is again living a clean liveall those like spiritual practices we speak of Madras specific meditations which kind of help ground you much more and when you have the grounding I'm guessing the given that increase your focus your discipline levels and therefore able to pull out things from that pool which is also why you see like it really talented creative professionals not really killed in the carrier even though they have all the skills you know in the Playbook they can't really converted into something because they lack that certain amount of groundingalso what I see wrong with a lot of young college kids especially many of them were taking off music fantastic musicians but just lakh that live in terms of grounding over think they have their draught a lot of negative scenarios a lot of them I mean while I understand that you can get away with having a not so on point Lifestyle I feel if you are trying to get somewhere in life and things aren't working out for you for a while you needkind of question the patterns your Living out in your daily life to that because that's what happened with me like I didn't read what I wanted to my first two years of doing YouTube can I change the things in me which eventually led to kya bolte hai like a catapult admin to like a new dimension so would you say there's been some kind of a sweet chat anyone I am not talking adjust your daily habits but in terms of was the only thing you did differently that just like elevated youone instance of one thought process change I I always want to be a better person the next day and I think it comes from like having a very interesting that thing that you said right now which which is very to have just seen a lot of people is that I mean to convey fundamentally really Break It Down to simple terms I think a lot of people have a very strong victim kaun kaun Complex like a lot of peoplethemselves victims constantly and that I think is a big barrier to you know because then you don't blame yourself or anything else just blame the surroundings for everything so if you're not doing well things are not going away instead of trying to like introspect within and see that ok what are the things that I might have done wrong you are constantly putting the blame on other people around you or circumstances around you and I used to have that basically the kinda like like an a I still do I thinkfree does we have days when we really feel like the world is against us and you know you just like any negative energy saving everything around you as the source of all your problems but what I realised and you know this is something I actually like my sister and my brother in law who are you know I am very close to them and this is something that like They brought to my notice like some years ago and not particularly to the me butthe very like overlooked human trait that like we all tend to be the protagonist of our own story and you know a lot of times we consider that protagonist to be the can of the victim of you know all the world's problems and it's not always the case then of course there are times when the world will actually be against you but the thing is that what I realise there's no point thinking about bad because I can't change the world I can't actually be on the pointis the largest circumstances and you know things around me all I can do is like learn to fight back and become a better person so that's like you got a focus on that and it still happens to me I still have days when I just feel excited about myself and I like everything is so unfair but then you like have to lighten up for the whole and be like OK what can I do to fix this so I think that's very important thing is that for sure and I think that is that is a big reason why a lot of peopleyou know owner of getting I want to because it becomes a vicious cycle you the more you think that you are the victim is actually do end up becoming one do you feel that your spiritual practices of kind of help Heal these boards from the past crys so lonely feel that you again you said however perfection is about making your coffee also I think that to be a good create a professional somewhere you could have that perfectionist element in you and the curse of thatself doubt because of a lot of for lack of a better word self-mutilation we're just like you know I hate me dude why am I not doing this well whatever so you feel like summer spirituality and links that for you yeah I think man to me like spirituality is also just a minute boils down to certain practices ride and its is again is very personal life for me at a point on my line live running really worked really well and that point I didn'tknow what any of these Aquarius and unavin introduced to the concept of spirituality more in the past couple of years and start doing Yoga couple of hours ago for the first time properly and last year for the first time properly and a lot of the thing that I was really completely against like astrology for example all I just think that people you know considered as part of life spirituality I have become more openbecause you know it has helped me to a certain degree but but that's only recently for a area or something else you know that I used to like run a lot like 10 kilometre that five times a week for months and that really helped me like you know just feel recently the other one hour of running everyday work and like metadata for me and I felt like I should come back and just like feel less anxious and you know less critical ofself and little like you know tired but in a good way and more productive the next day so you know there was one you doing nothing you have to everybody has to find their own personal base for doing it but for sure like you know it boils down to like doing things that definitely like make you feel better about yourself it sounds really simple enough to do something that makes you feel good but it actually not because you know say no to discover that thing that works for you that you can put into practicebasis and stick to that truly does good thing to you because a lot I am alive would you define is good in the moment might not be good for you no longer so you know like again while I have been advising people that they should find happiness first within themselves and stability first within themselves and then go out chasing relationships I feel like the correct romantic relationships alsocertain level of stability and balance to People's lives so dudh again considering the fact that you are in a stable relationship right now how much of a role does that play in your professional life like to just balance sheet out too kind of euro tell you that you are not a not actually as bad as you think you are auto just tell you not to just come down your head doesn't play any kind of rule and I think like not just meanybody whether you have professional goals or not and you know it's a stable relationship that make you happier I think I'm in a from what I've seen and I've been in a couple in my lifetime and like it's definitely a face which is you know has a lot of like personal comfort and there is a lot of like positive reinforcement from the other side which like you send me feel better about yourself so a lot of thetoxic ways you could be looking for validation outs you know from the outside world gets replaced by a mall healthy or form of validation from a partner can you explain this like a very cool thing you surprised when you break it down a little more the toxic versus positive its like men and think almost everybody order is a bit insecure in overall insecure actually we all have certain in securities in different aspects and I think that like we're all and because of that were seeking validation and you know and thisforms of seeking validation and it could be like just a night out with your friends and getting really drunk girl like you know like excessive use of social media for this in today's world largest term indulging in activities that feel like give you join the moment but I actually am not healthy in a long term in the so many examples ride versus that I think and we need that actually to a certain degree and I think you have the right partnerit just they will not like you do not need the doors toxic form validation anymore you get a much healthier form because that's the point Rider mean of family and friends and loved ones around you want to the point that leads to like somebody that adding the like look you are really good person like you don't like don't be harder myself and I do that for my friends in my family sometimes and like they do that for back for me some days and I have my Lo moment you know and I will you Momedian up being ready self 84like my girlfriend with tell me that like to check out more like things are not that bad and shall show me the right decision me like you know why am I I am a good person and that give me perspective I think they're really like it is a very it's another like another way of Canada like really centring and grounding yourself feel like it just makes you like it it takes off all the other precious so you can focus on what really matters which in my case is like you know writingsongs I can actually write focus on that I do that so dear good and bad of subjective words like when you say that something is good it's in your head you've already compared to probably a so-called bad moment from your past you know from your reference points so do like why do you say that your current relationship is good like what constitutes a happy positive relationship in the now other than what you just said about you know that person feels about thatinsecurity why do whatever you want to call it what else like constitutes a positive happy relationship and they definitely that is one of the things I can mandali personal question in the sense that like hard to answer your like I think it's a very it's a personal choice that differs from person to person I think you need to can a look at is a disorder simple answer for the new catalogue within yourself to to know what you wantyour partner thing for me is definitely the that one aspect which is scanner like Instinct why you feel comfortable with the other person you can a trust them instinctively that's really really important if I can't trust other person then you know I can not like be in a serious relationship with a contrast that is the economy as trade up like because I feel like that probably require everybody I mean of this is that such an important thing andsomebody who can I help you grow you see yourself like growing with and who pushes and that's and that thing is a personal thing like I am the kind of person like who wants to be a better person tomorrow in every way and I want to be with somebody who portions that was as you know like and that and that has nothing to do with the other person being a good person or a bad person is just like I think it's how you like your energies interact and how you like and Unlike the dynamic between the two people some people who judgesymbiotic like this they really push each other in a healthy way in the right direction and I would hope to be an you know a relationship that Jod I think that's best ideal think why do you think divorce is happened like in general like my theory is that people grow into different versions of themselves as they grow older and also this whole thing about you when you live with someone It kind of changes the dynamic dude it's like especially for gaithat's why the concept of a man cave exists in the first place that I just wanna be isolated and Asin Asin some of the most successful marriage is around me have an element of the man cave within the house and not the same and keep both the partners can spend time in their own little zones away from them so I think that's the reason there was a happening now a days to do you think I mean I don't know but nowadays man I think like a thing for a long time divorces and this is thislisten to my theory it for a long time divorces didn't happen in India because I just like the exorcism Amina just I think like the women of like a mother generation and effort to click the brunt of the issues and it was such a big social Taboo for a divorce to happen that is never happened today I think like it's in a way a good sign because I like it just means that women are as a known as empowered unfortunately but they are definitely more power than the used to be which is livereally good sign in another good thing that like suicide is moving forward well liked both partners of other sites have like voice which is important which is why there is also like more contract I think that that's kinda like you know one answer the other thing also which is just like the early from the perspective of Lake by a relationship break in a divorce is just like you know basically two people falling apart and I thinkone thing that you said is definitely a reason I think sometimes there are a couple who don't give each other in a space and it just comes from a place of lack of communication I feel like I feel like a lot and people don't actually Express themselves like if you know the guy wants to have one hour alone or like another person leg in the I I wanna be the guy on the girl like no one person has two hours alone every day they might be scared to say it saying thinking that like the other personfeel like something that goes on for ages and lekin O Ultimate Avengers end up having this massive like blow out because of this is depressed feeling of just need some space from day to day so and it's nothing wrong with that you know like amena think we need space we need to have our own time is well writing a successful relationship a lot like you said we'll have that aspect was carved out where is like we're here for each other we love each other and we are each other's rocks but at the same timeI need to have two hours that I am just like alone like listening to music or watching this movie or whatever you know it is a very personal thing some people might like it some people might not but you should be able to express set and get out the way instead of replacing at about trust right now ok and again that also subjected to ensure that at some point in your pass you had your trust broken or you know that's what's resulted in using the right now seeing you at thatme as well you know Guru cheated on the more than Once by black people who invested a lot of time energy and all in now in saying that I feel every human is born with certain intrinsic gold so you have like career goals or whatever you can to build as you grow up like ok that's why I want to be with them somewhere in your heart you have like this kind of goals for your life that have always been there always had thehaving a really good stable relationship you know like call it a married call it a long-term thing that's why I asked the question why do these divorce divided breakup happened like what goes wrong which is also why people gravitate towards ROM coms and Prateek kuhad songs because a lot of purity in that can music that's that's what love sounds like to a lot of people like for example Dil Beparwah talks about that would like the lyricsrepeal of the song is the same cause of radio even if I have been mistreated of my heart my trust broken I am still gonna go for it again so that coming from that intrinsic Gola in 3rd sem intrinsic goal of a stable relationship exists for a lot of Indian I don't know whether it's of our culture and we are extremely romantic people know what it is but made you think about the do think about your long-term future to think about life in father holding shit like that something I've been thinking about a lot for some randomI am dislike weightlifting do do things about Protein Shakes Where are these father thoughts coming from the coming up from somebody place within my sold forward you had an Omen Aisi like I feel like I can barely you not take care of definitely not ready for father that definitely like scares me that I am not I am not therefore shawl and I am Koi like fluid man in the sense about like the this questiona long term relationship I think that like I a struggle with this like this thought that this definitely a lot of comfort is so much comfort in a relationship you know I mean just having the study person who looks out for you when you love anyone them around all the time with a beautiful thing like you know I love him that page but at the same time I feel like it should not be a crutch you know it's not like there is a and and thankfully I don't think I am in thatbut like I feel like I've seen people who are in relationships because you know that rather not be alone habit a yes sometimes the power of habit sometimes people who has always like dated people from an early age so they just are so petrified of being alone that day was date anybody and then they make a lot of compromises and end up with a really bad people sometimes and like you know that I am a conscious of thatsome all a lot and worried that I am I grow up I hope I'm not doing that like and I think that an important thing because I think you need to be and and can goes back to something that is a little while ago and that you need to be strong yourself before can and may be the wrong what is but before gana like deserving somebody else I know you need to be like a really strong secure ok with yourself to be able to give yourself fully to another person because you also have that responsibility rightyou not like if you are in a relationship with those works both ways I am in your getting something you're getting the support and emotion because you are also giving that back and that's how it is and that's the beautiful thing about it so it is important that you are really like strong and that's the only like question I think about which is the Asset that like it can elect fluid for me that like I don't want to be in a place where I want to be scared about not being in a longrelationship because I want to feel like you're not confident enough about myself in the sense that I can like handle any situation myself so I am with somebody because that just profile me even farther and makes my life better and there is better on or weakness of like a choice to like you know exceed my own Expectations and overall I cannot be an even better person on a street decode these difficult questions through the podcast on isliye so if I feel like a gasdoes give a certain subject a lot of thought time I'll always ask that guest about that subject and that is why I wanted to ask you about relationships but the other kind of domain in Prateek kuhad feel is it explode a lot by audience is this depth of thought thing I knew your deep guys because of the lyrics and all that but I feel it it doesn't just apply to your sense of love I will you create love songs because somethe businessman in new way like I know that this will do well ok understaffing wrong Eenadu like I know I'm a good fitness videos that will continue making physical fitness you do I talk a lot more about Ayurved if I could be coming back to the point I feel as if ki question I wanna ask you would cause of your in like a really good high point in your career like a like a lot and listen to your music and the lockdown update show you seen a lot of growth factor attended one day live concert on Instagramlosing the shit people using this thing that question is that I feel this four things primarily that reveal the character of a person one is like extremely deep question which is what we try doing on the Runway show the second is some kind of trauma for example even this coronavirus situation could be considered as a form of trauma for a lot of people even offerthis infectious disease of the oh my god I am either really scared or really brave Warrior Li positive really negative III would be long term relationship that something and reveals ke your character ki how do you react when you're stuck to the same person for next 10 years and the fourth one which is what I want to talk to you about his power which could be considered money / Fame but I will Fame reviews it even more than money to do like how is like Famechange your life like what do you see like anything about your thought process and all that I still on AC and I'm going to be honest I like I don't feel that famous and I deny that the few times before and I got like criticism from people are you like you I am proud to be like Iron ki or like and it really is like that and I don't know if it's because maybe this is not enough for me maybe I am like immune to it and Ithink about it as much I'm not really sure why but it it it it it goes up and down you know actually actually the real thing is not like I don't feel with goes up and down the main points in your life and you do feel like that and then it's followed up with like really humbling experiences so that I have seen which is why which is which invariably and the gana like putting it back into how I was anyway and I get back to focusing on you know doing what I do which is like riding a songso that's one thing I mean you know an example of that to explain that is a gain of I go onto an application to 6,000 people and everybody is going nuts then like you feel very famous right when you get of state you like top of the world if you like shit holy crap and then like you know maybe two weeks later your like just at home and you know is just a quiet day and maybe it's Friday night and all your friends are busy and you know if you should just like board and alone and you like shit like what the heckreply shed its like that happened to me you know so you have days when and those data on field famous I just feel like so it's very like it's confusing thing I did not definite shows you of how it affected my like thought process is really hard to say I am like selfie never enough to answer that question I am sure I have changed you know it is its everybody changes anyway every year so it's unlikely that the fastfrom where was to be admitted they have not changed how I change really hard to say OK coming to the third point of the question of the second Bolero Mein which when it was second point what has the coronavirus lockdown done for you as a creative professional what is changed when you as a human being the creative professional practice as a person water change one it's been a while motorcycle forced holiday actually at an entire thing in a good way in this and thatplease send me a lot you know I've put in a lot of flag consistent like practices that I used to follow in the early part of my career which is just like being healthy and eating healthy and sleeping well over a factor of that is also because I started you know like last year I started dating who I am dating right now my girlfriend like that is also helped alot in like all of this and we both help stabilize can each other butbecause of the lock down because it can of forced me to like slow down and just stop you know travelling like a crazy person and like this being constantly overwhelmed by the things that are happening and and I am like that I respond to stimuli so like if 20 things are happening around me work visa want to all of them and make sure that happen on time and all that have been very well so stuff just stopped happening you know for the first woman special yours alt tag like nobody was working and there were no Expectations that canposter soda which is good and in a way and I just hope it doesn't take this because that has never do it with my life but hopefully like it's one of those thing that's like karna just got me ready for the next phase of my life I feel like you know when things get busy again I will be physically mentally and emotionally in a bed of space to be able to deal with those challenges so I hope you know I feel like I mean anMS Academy want to believe that like that of the lockdown has done for me I was having this weird kind of feeling for the last two weeks I discussed it with my co-founders well now while I was a young entrepreneur young entrepreneur that goes like between 20 to 25 at kind of Look At people who had these theories on nihilism and existential crisis moments and and just say that you I I just feel that maybe you don't have a solid gold your workinglike my kind of Escape that ok I want to build these companies are you want to build this YouTube channels available as a growing up and as the great money is increasing sales increasing numbers are increasing ok at the same time I am giving more and more of myself to my work more and more of my emotions to the earthquake creating as X passing by and recent in the lockdown violation amazing for me up discovered a lot of things about myself picked up new skillslord I do have these questions about why am I doing this job you know what what am I working toward what is the meaning of all this like why do people consciously take up entrepreneurship of being a youtuber if it's this intense when you know if I go to a beach and I met a guy who sells coconut them and he seemed like the happiest guy in the world if everything that we work for is centred around the concept of happiness why is an entrepreneur / youtube and you have to go so highthe paint and my answer to that has just been in the start of this podcast we spoke about you yourself being a channel for art and even entrepreneurship is 8 and a lot of ways do you think of business studies have to create things I just feel it ok if God of the universe has selected me as that guy after just serve my purpose as a channel for growth of other people growth of like this are to happen which is my question to you dude what youanswer to that question why does Prateek kuhad exist in this World War 2 was again this is like you know the golden question Hamein you know I have and I had this like doubt in my head like all the time like every now and then it's you know it's definitely happen to be in the lockdown after a while because I feel like the past year and half was so busy that things went in a Blur and then I slowed down I was like you know and you have so much time to think that your brain goes to all kinds of places in the new livedo I want to keep doing this like I will talk to my girlfriend like man let's seriously just like go to you know and see the doctor so she can like you know what can even then she can go and I shall find a job in hospital anywhere so I am like analysis move To The Hills and like get a place and like grow some vegetables and just just that they do that for two years I seriously considered that one day I was a glamorous I cannotthat's the question of that people have asked for a like millions of years write like why 2 weeks is vital to what we do I don't I don't know if it's the UN and actually the way I like to think of it is that you know to me almost like the goal of my life is not happiness a lot of people feel like we know feel like that and therefore the lot of people the ultimate goal is like to be a happy person and I don't think it's that simple because from what I have alwayslike happiness is a relief fleeting feeling sometimes it's like a really good for a day and I know you feel that moment it's it's not that simple I don't know what motivates us but like it can a good thing you know and I go with it because it can I like a good thing it just feels like this is the direction any to go in and that's where like I don't have an answer and you know one possible answer is what you said that like they all just like meant to be a vessel and equipment to be 200things because you know we are meant to do that and we are meant to help people whatever it's also supposed to happen and you know that I am I am not quite I don't know I mean I don't make me feel a bit odd because I feel like I'm kind of powerless and This can happen and I don't like that because I also like to feel responsible for my actions they feel like you know everything that has happened for me and around me is because also I really pushed towards it and like I worked hard for it so that the part of me that you know you want to buildalso a part of me which feels like you know so many of those things would have never happened I mean just really my hard hard work there is definitely like I am definitely had like luck or whatever you want to call it on a lot of things happen by chance lot of things happened because teachers can happened and its back and I have no explanation for it so I don't know it's an answer question that's completelywhich is also why I started thinking so much more about both romantic and family relationships because I feel that also feels that were a little bit like maybe maybe my purpose is to be there for this particular soul of this particular souls that that could be apart the purpose but when I I study this question from a spiritual perspective and take a deep dive into the heavy spiritual books the answers I get there are slightly different where they talk about having your career and life purpose andspiritual purpose and usually when your job is creative and again that could even be business why you are creating something for the world you do achieve your spiritual purpose partly through your job so that for example this cold mess again like I'm give you my own example I was going to like a really really tough situation in my love life and that's song while it hurt me alot it did leave me slightly more healed you know sometimesis too kind of make sentence with pain will try hurting yourself more just filled completely and I will be like cool cool my husband that for a lot of people may be down your purpose do like that came out through you kind of helping a lot of people out there so what's your last like kind of life learning do from always yours superdeep Gai what's what's like your last bit of you know I do I doadvice but was your last why we want to leave the word answers of you know like personal answer you know I am just being like how I think about those things and its just yeah I don't have anythingDiamond things that happen and then you just can I go that I guess a lot of it is that I don't know how is to say it was really like silly but it I feel like I just go with things actually to beyond a certain point like however much planning there is in you know I react to things most in the sense like ok today this happens to this also I feel you have a strong sense of discipline planning your professionalism perfectionism you want to call it thatso while I think that your modesty is speaking up dude you don't own Technology yourself for that which also I am brings me to the absolute final question how can a young kid become the next Prateek kuhad like how do you become the next Prateek kuhad other than the professionalism and perfectionism factor you should do what you want when everybody has a different path I know everybody has a different way of getting weather 2 and and that the ki actually I thinklike you have to really you should prove within as much as you can I get to know yourself really well so that you can make the right decisions for yourself and its and you know getting other people's advice and following examples is a great thing I have done that myself I've read like people biographies who have respected and what they've done but I never like it anything in the sensor can never just like done something and applied it to mylife just because it works for somebody else but I have applied if I feel like it works for me so secure like you read stories of 10 people and you feel like you know that one have a does Grid as another habitats create that another one and add over the act and have read about you only apply to the yourself maybe because that was applicable for you in your contacts and your life and what you on your needs and your desires and your strengths and weaknesses and it's really important to be self aware I thinkonly when you self where can you make the right decisions for yourself and you need to just be but gutsy because the other problem is that even if you are self-aware a lot of people are too driven by what other people say and what other people posting to do and the can a world v11 like we will always have people around us who will prashasan directions whether it's like friends or family all I got teachers or society or what you read of propaganda what the heck you know so it'sat some level again you take all of that is feedback information but it's really important to like look deep within and be absolutely sure that you are doing what you want to do and not what like somebody else what you do you have any tips on how one can become more self-aware I think it's like a practice you get do in the sense that it is a process to get better at the more you affect you say no to become more self-aware you first fall have toI I guess you know acknowledge the fact that you might not be self care because a lot of time people don't change because they don't think they need to so you know I am still all the time questioning myself even till today that like you know what I'm doing in how I am doing it is it you know coming from the right place or not and am I getting influenced by the right people in the right surroundings you always questioning and laborious a lot of people don't do it because it's hard for you don't wanna live get up everyday with a doubt in your headsucks you don't just feel like good about thing and everything is great but the moment you ask those hard questions it causes some turmoil within it important to like let that will happen and only then can you actually like reach the like the Crux of the problem and or actually so self awareness is can I like comes from self awareness I get the better of a weird I'm saying like as to be built you build stamina for self awarenessI mean this just popped into my head after you answer the question I will that you do becomes alphabet through questioning other people about the said that going on in your head example this podcast for the version of yourself by asking you my existentialism questions and Android so that I actuallyhard part is observing their own mind through things like we're passionate and all that definitely has to closing eyes and sensors and all the sensors are doing any work the next day and at your own thoughts and we will don't meditate with your pic too much negativity in my meditation and all that the negativity your confronting and thus leaving you so important that my also but Mr Prateek kuhad thank you brother this is a lot of fun dude down this roadko down these roads on movin music but I'm glad we did this and check out a lot of

browser you still my hero brother your all of India's you I want to ask you the first question how often when you come to India due ke dostMujhe favourite Indian actress alerts Mumbai favourite is always the pakka 1 answer what is often when you are in India and now I can't just a few words in a file of India obviously I do love India typicalI love Indian food and all of these questions are you know when you go to a new country in the first thing we usually learn is the Curse words write like like the cal is a few and a fewlive shoot anatomia video everything take over take over take over when should you know when I was in the West Indies team isDada time in 2016 after btech in India and not the mouth of the semi final in world kidney day and Tier 1 kilo stand up on chair and club pain and that was created in OU you know a team of nothing but the beat team India in of the more than a own background and then the entire crowd around and started club in a supporter new analysis to move and Ornate ornament we hadnation of India supported and unsupported West Indies and that means a lot to us because whenever we come to IPL inoviea represent different franchise is done what do we have played a game desperate to play the game and the way we entertain defines 8 income at separate a separate from the other players were not take anything away from the other players were developed their performances but I guess the way we will ever libraryDukh Bhari same time we entertain people so you know how I feel that when you playing support our country you carry the Vibe of your country into the sport shoe for example in India and all were horses had this happen if you see someone like Virat Kohli so what is that for caribbeancricket like what you all carry into the spotlight what the people carry on the spot on people's life is beach parties have fun and entertainmusic festivals alarm music shows take place in the Caribbean and natural entertainers and biwi Anadi some teams are developed based on running between wickets speed and agility and in all these things we base empower coronavirus speed and agility as well but we will I get in 6s love sixesMini 10 show the format you know you send kar be relaxed but to be an international athlete I feel you need that little bit of A G Road make it your country so you play for Trinidad and Tobago vs Jamaica that can your domestic competitions yes but only few people get selected to play for the windies so my question to you is how do you balance that relaxed facto with something else what is the other thing you need to break out if there is an individual choice of the day another dayif you want something bad a life you know you after sacrifice make sacrifices in any of the status of NGOs and go of the fbd to many of the wanted and in order that the people who love these opportunities as well so if you wanted belong to who wanted more and the staff were performed to have been very curious about growing up is that you know when you have a relaxed mentality are some of the Caribbean do you also have low moments like the way you are self doubt as an athleteyou have you know just a lot of attention in your mind about OK will I be dropped will you why we will perform like that side of the kitten for West Indies cricketers or not that happens every one you all is world where are you will be selective inhibitor of what are you good enough that I am not good enough for me I don't think about what is the you ever think about these things for I was always been relaxed right from Champions TrophyMalaysia luck because I am always a mushroom believer in what is the people always be if I am I found to be selected to be selected to be draw power bi drop if I am going to perform I will perform like I live my life like that I have it in my train properly I will be honest with myself and prepare myself while so whenever I got a perform I am full confidence and my ability that I am going to perform if I don't peoplethen I start second guess tell myself that I never know what is pretty well but when you say you are honest with yourself like what do you mean like what do you do if I have worked on the man company Parmeshwar prepare for the tournament I trained and nitrogen specifically for the tournament dependent on who I am coming up again I do with it I visualise I do all these things if I am not have the winter war theme I come in the play again I gogame throughout the night before 5 days before leading up to the game and go through it in your mind that you will live in my mind and practice I will try to bowl like sirf am coming up against you or the same practice bowling against the wall bhi bol into one of my teammate but I will realise it's you but it got to buy boat was like the planner come come in UP against you done so for example for where is Mumbai Indians after both hardI will satterfield FIR bola the hare ko Pollard what are the executed the MS Innova so happy pay myself so when I turn up in the game I feel comfortable in my preparation of my ability and I trust my my my would that you know I can deliver sometimes they don't deliver but that's ok and I just accept that can move on to what happened an extremely high pressure situations where you beat my team here is ko the50 runs in the last IPL an extremely high pressure situations where does pressure new single and lead to make a team will be back Pradip u bolate in the energy you always hypersensitive to what happens in your mind just you live for those moments I strive on on on competing against the best they know that when the best part of me and dispersion Hai sit I must situation prashnawali game is onI like the responsibility of having the ball in my hand but in my hand and doors can't moment because I but myself all the time and I believe I can get a job done if the responsibility is with me if it isn't someone else and then I don't have full control with my hands and I have full control over what I can do and but I said it had the opportunity to the ball and my hand and the last over doesn't guaranteewin right but I feel safer and play the things around the world will happen please stay for knowing that they have meta bola Subah Vinay back and other and self belief I have a myself that I can do incredible things I think that self belief trickles down was also seen a member for your team's so it comes down to the whole squad like just when Chennai playing we can see the Libra of layer in legwomen question to you now as a coming out a song called Jamia and throw your music career is taking off in this country as well in India as well so what we learn from cricket that you are applying to all these things are doing outside of created by brand the DJ Bravo brand as a professional cricketer and I can never take anything away from cricket cricket give me everything and everyone my fan following is because ofthe like I wish you were here in India is because of what I have done in cricket so I have to accept that and appreciated that the DJ Bravo brothers have Mike lorelai I have not get into music de so much things I want to do I have my charities and only stuff so music is a big part of my life meaningmusic artist someone idolize a lot because of him I get into music my very first song was the theme you're not going to say that in mind when idle of yours I know that Brian Lara with another use idle and growing up you said that you want to become the next Brian Lara Badi became the first doing Bravo Divas think of that that gained weight now kids are looking at me and saying I wanna be the next Dwayne Bravo adjust live my life very easy happy that try to INRwe're all here for a short period of time and the moment we should have used in the world in a positive way to do that Cricket Under the banner of a music so I don't want to make people some people who can't live the dream demonstrate the left Atrium Tumi avondale Dance music like you must be inspired by CM a lie with me how I go about yourself what would you go and tell that nine year old 10 year old doing nowgo back what's the advice given I think straight on his life so line I don't drink alcohol I don't gamble I don't smoke so there is nothing I could go back and tell on mentality a newer version of you what I had but there is what I have now I am still still still nothing changednow maybe I can say anything because how I think Bagnan is same I think no my my dedication my commitment my attitude is the same nothing changes the only thing changed now I become more popular and have financially in a better position but as the only think but the mentality is the same mentality is the same I drive with the same I my passion is the same my Honge everything isGod see you mentioned that you don't drink or smoke and you know that the stereotype with cricketer cricketer laughter party and also with people from the Caribbean in a lot of internationally people have the stereotype order of the lord of we do whatever they might never been so my question to you is like what kept away from party like was it the cricket I just know what I ammyself so I don't want to in the general covid-19 in Dalton drugs I don't know never so grown up with your parents tell you need to hit a certain age before you start drinking alcohol weather 16 some countries 1816 some different person carbon is 18 and over and the at 10:00 I made my zonal team on the 15thEastern so between 10 to 15 I was focus on cricket and then I made the national team at 14 years old and I took my first flight away from Trinidad weather to make a the form their own I get understand like how important it is to be completed because you have a paternity therapies and the country so when you drink you some with me to the samescout the night before the country in the next day they have over the country and properly there there you can all over the place is the mayor does that make sense so why Ok my survive I put my body today's if it is I can go out have so much fun and still wake up the next day come train in and we get and do what I have to do I perform without alcohol in my system from there and then I made it a duty that I should nevercall ID is no point in drinking alcohol when it is the next day feel hangover feel tired then was it was the point but I do party and I do have fun with I don't want to put the thing I don't I know that I have fun I have you know X it is the queen of this does not important in order things is more important but definitely alcohol drugs and gamble in cricketyou seen a lot has become successful you see in the of 5 fails while writing by now in that position to tell this person might succeed this person might fail what is the formula for Union head like how are you able to tell that I don't think disposal make it and I do think this personal naked my guess is that have the talent from God that if you can spot someone and they know for sure that they have talent that can make it without seeing them after 2 go to what I have to do itbut without the talent but I'm asking in terms of mentality and in terms of you know the habits in all the what do you spot the person the next thing that gets person be successful or not you will have the spider verse in order to go to that like you can guess what someone and say ok this would make it if you don't have the Talent that we can make it for you force of the sea the talent and then nodal make it and then then you start the attitude and what did she is weather todaycommitted to whether some people have natural talent but they don't have the discipline of some people have disappeared and they don't have the talent and you also played with Dhoni you played with Sachin you played all these Gods of Indian cricket your due to the law of domestic cricket was well from India what is the difference you see in like se Dhoni and Virat versus the domestic Indian cricketers in the mentality because it very difficult to break out in this country Especially to comparative the messageworld is great players are named they had a unique way of doing things are no Sachin Dhoni device special and I am what I see is that they know what they want in life and their critical and people does everything lab preparation in order to prepare well and relax and come in the video as well as Adobe Flash that Bala things and didn't let a lot of things outside of cricket in open both of them but I am now my next questionabout your body you are an all rounder I know this is a social problem cricket you can enjoy a critical of their fitness you still really fit die on a personal level what do you do for your fitness like I know you will be the weight room will be on cricket field would you take us to achieve the weight room situation like what do you guys do cricketers in the world with heavy ways we do a specific exercise the activated in musclesfast bowlers will be different the Batman and advice was so hard for me as I need to have an aspect lekin for me but I do a lot of work wear in that can help my Ham strings on lower back my my my growing and oldest thing because of being named after both so many overs are now so I do a dost Prince Arthur keep my I am sharing and old is Masters afterwards the Godon a diet level what do you do I eat

stretchtablet techno supplements I don't do know it no protein buy anything like that I from my body is feeling good then does it eat sleep you know what I get from you right now that you're kind of Businessman Mod right now in life live it like that things are getting in the my question is that what do cricketers especially caribbeancricket is do with the money like after you IPL done the Carriers that you plan your money is there are also part of the businessprocess I know what I do with my money money everyone decide what they do what they want money again at it is their money for me

I am feeling and lonely I call one of my girlfriend and they spend time with me and what I have my children also does doing never feel down and lonely now some time now and I have a girlfriend call be

do my days pretty much still like I will sleep until I killer 11011 then I'll go and pick up my daughter school at 233 my son and then by the time they no 67 and go to the gym and thenNayak 91011 avalosunda go to the club and come back home when for clockin the people around you and of 10 in in Australia and South and England and these countries but I never really come across it in the West Indies batting that may be the pressure of a country like Australia India aur England and the media pressurized you guys create and cry on the birthplace of the take from form for median andit's tough to Canada without you much done a lot of people think that because you are Aati Kya sportsman you are not you Manu you are not so Hawa life outside of what to do for outside of cricket or that of Sucker and put so much pressure on you was the individual so if you don't perform the best of your ability it's like a sun some players Kandila than in the amount of time youyou as a professional cricketer you spent and half month away from home away from my family in a way for miss you after the former kids away from your girlfriends that that is pressure in itself then if you don't perform well you have wall is made up attention and media pressure sore after some old different unless it has said it is sad moments on the essays lonely sometimes in the most teams only allow yourpartner to travel for few weeks on tour so it had had been a professional athlete but it's the know your way from the people you love what you do in the things that you love to get a balance but I know Maxwell and definitely will bongswag cases is a flash player and is a very nice guys so it was sad that these things happen in a lot and get dirty come forward andcupboard my question my network news about India what have you learnt from this country because you have Indian now take back a lot of stuff with you for life so what we learn from this country people are really dedicated what they do their job and whether it's a graphic designer and ask peoplecommitted to the work and they never passionate about a country and I wish people in my country was passionate about a country and they know that the country India means so much to the people over here I am not saying like the people tend to be good enough to share our country but for us as a set our culture so late but we take anything for granted in also like our country have the most holidays in aif you break the record with the next day the holiday homework we just enjoy life on party your life is about that but I just wish I just wish we can this be a little more person or more supportive of each other in a dress that you think that will help the country grow because the other hand if you didn't do a research on the big o u been an overturnedyou have to do I was a little I call it a finger people no of to make a win over Jamaica I did not have to Google where to make a Trinidad and Tobago is 2 hours from Jamaica banala people don't know what are the main goal is so I can say that I am 1500 metre body culture and country we are any other have nothing that levelbut you know you said that a trinidadian can Logon say something like commitment that passion from India what do you think India can learn from the world you travel the world so what is one thing that we can do better how can we improve theirGoogle can improve an even the big will want to come to India everyone wants to come the internal even musicians back home and my country talk about my god you have this market that won't take me India want to go to India and all these things India is the country of Dreams in so they take selfies the when I am going and going tocase When You Walked around in this country the selfie everyday Vande Vande ek photo ek photo ek photo do in my last last like to question the one is that is there any aspect of spirituality in your life that you know you lean on an emotional support you believe in God but living definitely Christianmy to believe in god comes in a plane ticket like when you up on the field due think of it I think of God and feel but again how I live my life I know there is a God and I live my life clean an honest I prefer for health and I pray for those that prefer success and for guidance is most important thing when you knowthey will be individuals who and success of the preferred guidance and protection laws of a preference in Innova but I don't live my life in fear I don't Envy anyone jealous of anyone and a number I am not intimidated by anyone so that you should expect that just me and you mummy in like live my life like that so you know but I know the things that happen for meI know there is a God because of a nice y z cities miracles that make up a champion song for example that God was because champion song was recorded in 2015 after I want my first CPL Trophy in 2015 are recorded champions of the cause and 2015 was when I was dropped for West Indies team and I was supposed to go to the world cup in 2015 but I wasboth of them and that time was my lowest moment and then I want them play CPL an event that time I get back consern Pharma champion regardless of what people try to bring me down open down my name of Western my commitment I am still able to rise the recorded the song champion and never released until 2016 which was one year later I really said one year later and then we went to win the World Cup and I willbaby 4 Player full game of the world cup and then went on to win the World Cup have become Champions and in the sun went viral so how can you record a song called in the song champion keep it really said one year later when I will come and have become the internationalalways tell people nothing happened before its time and what is the baby will always be so for example this interview we are doing now had was that took place at this day at this time that any that I didn't plan did you done plan that half an ability and think that damn will god given ability not everyone can do what I do you think of it and you have gratitude in your heart like all the timebecause I think relaxation comes out from also because they are more thing that you say for example I am in India I am not an Indian body crazy love and support I get India his crazy in our life I think I am one of the few International cricketers are coming that get crazy love you are out so and and because of what I've done a cricket fielder know and I were present MumbaiChennai Super Kings Tour de biggest franchise in IPL history and also not just be a part of a team but also have much winner performance that people can remember and cherish videos of the life so like these things mean a lot to the funds and this thing in a lot to me so I guess I am happy because you believe in god and you feel that inspiration is a big part of your career my question to usecould you what are the three things you would like to tell a kid today all over the world to me Indian it is maintained at three things you learn from life believe in yourself believe in God what you want in life after it don't take no for an answer just go of the your dream and your passion follow your heart thank youwhat you want in life after it don't take no for an answer just go off the your dream and your passion follow your heart queen thank you

one is by far I think my most intellectual episode the most analytical episode possibly one of the deepest conversations and ever had in my life but we recorded it for this podcast Mr Ronnie screwvala is one of the most respected entrepreneurs in India today he is created businesses in everything from the toothbrush industry to the cable TV industry to UTV of course that's the one is known for the most but right now he isroundabout 57 58 years old and he is getting into the world of education and getting his hands dirty in the world of entrepreneurship again his lawn something for upgrade with intense on overtime revolutionizing the Indian education system the way people learn intent on spreading knowledge intensive reading inspiration that much what we did in today's episode as well trust me if someone knows you Ronnie screwvala is wood industry in an interviewdoes one get ready that absolutely change of your world is my mind is an ocean of knowledge experience and you know what his story also began with him rebelling against his parents just like most of us he had to fight in order to become an entrepreneur to convince parents that entrepreneurship is the way to go if someone is self tories and an MBA is figure out this world himself by working on his communication skillsbusiness knowledge and human psychology disorders episodes about so if you want to do business in your life but we just want to expand the boundaries of your mind Ronnie screwvala on the Ranveer show is good with and CO2 episode for you I promise you never know what this one multiple times for the given mine all the time stamps are given below and of course it's already new channel School the Ranveer show clips clips of this episode will be happen that channel soon but for now Ronnie screwvala onshow everybody welcome to the Ranveer show drafting on the show the five people and listed as green gas one of them today check Talking Tom Mr Ronnie screwvala and I would say dream with your eyes open for shall I am going to pick your brain during the second was my first question is that wheneverin a meeting room that's full of a lot of big businessman on Yuva Complex always talked about us the bigger the bigger the bigger like why do you think that is why do when a group for coronavirus racing time tok.com please people from them but anything elsewhat is whether that's a cistern in the sporty by bro coronavirus in my life for a long period of time I had fun with my surname have you ever had big screw UPS in your life let them in all aspects ok my first question is how did you convince your parents that you want to be a businessman because I know there was an issue for you somewhere in the dayrelative I think that there's a lot to win an important question is why should we be like in India but I think parents are worried and they normally concern and I think that's what everyone goes through it if you're going through in the 90s and you go 2020 2020 and sons Of War and I think the more you can communicate with them it solves the problem because at the end of the day they feel you are in control of the situation as a people want Dragon a particular direction of course my parents were minimised Chartered Accountancyhell bent on not doing it but I think the conversation that I had with them constantly during this process of them being worried I think helped amazing today if you are interested people to call just communicate because I actually they feel your comfortable than a girl be less than or less than this one it is your biggest piece of advice to that he doesn't that position right now is it communicate with your parents and explain your business idea and normal you feel it is a generation gap will be really understandBarun need to understand but they just need to know they need to know and receiving your eyes in senior body language is your confidence level then sent to all your communication and it can be sold at one time because the main point everyone feels like I said it once I said it was is it right I am not having this conversation again it will take time but if you really want that parental support at the young age is very important that you continue to go and thoughts of parent process right and we don't do that wewe can do it without that ecosystem and support but I think it's so much better when you have it so I want to tune you out from being 22 and back into being your current age I heard you say in an interview that 60 is the new 40 right why do you say that much harder you can stay fit your sinkiang you need to be surrounded by people who was thinking younger than you and just the speed at which things are moving that's pretty much it and talk to meanbinmadal rhyming 40 because really I think I am working with almost everyone I am doing here I work with half my age and I'm enjoying it and I don't I still see myself in the age group of them I don't see myself as the elder in the room that is why I see myself as the elderly room I want to get the motivation of the trend that I've seen it feel like you're kind of take both those boxes in your life where is this motivation coming from to run something like upgrade at your age motivationalabout 3 years back of his back I decided roll my eyes lit up and start all over again the start of the very first co-founded the very first team the We All Be Together in a forest coming together it's the excitement is excitement of the unknowns excitement doing something and different people look at things differently Ahmed Dua I like doing things I like n and not just because I won't stay active everything as you grow up and since you said that in a card to my presentyadala things I would not like to do and I think I have the comfort BA will be a little bit more Pinky what are the things that don't do versus things I want to do not in terms of work but just in terms of what I want to spend my time doing what you're not want to spend your time I think what I am look I definitely don't spend time transporting myself from home to a workplace more than 10 minutes on my first thing I don't spend too much time with people and interacting and building such a large organisationmy time is going to go with people traction I win matches I can't have a conversation with you and correct lose weight is all about working with people but I guess your address on stage in age you can get somebody else is going to do that while you work with the smaller group of people in the those groups of people converted logical that my fighter fighter theory I believe that was it would be a pilot then you can be the control room telling for pilotsvery big 245 leaders that you've picked know there are three co founders and close the leaders and that's the beauty of it I think my second innings and what I am starting off with everything is about finding the right kind of partners the right colleagues write like minded people and half marriage in order to build Nexus big businesses and inaudible Nexus business Carriers do you need to do an MBA in today's DNH and the wrong guy or maybe the right kind of depending on who wants to ask that question so you arepersonally it up as a personal choice my straight answer is no and you have any regrets remit know what is a personal choice it's about what you think you lack of the time in which you thought you want to like it I think the good part today is a people looking at it that of an MBA doing something at least three to four years after they started working on the road on job that's good to give you have a clear perspective of your lacking but I would say for doing something MBA does a 21st century MBAin the context of an ambient doing it for a purpose of degree has gone away long back and you need to be very clear why you're doing it and you are doing for marriage certificate in udemy not doing it only to get yourself a good job so why you're doing it so you end up working with a lot of people who are spread across different industries my question to you is what do you see MBA is in the modern day have that non MBS don't sometimes it's a structure ok I think it's 50telling all people here that right now for me I am doing more and learning that I am doing learning and that's the best part of learning and I know it sounds and I want dumb it down as a social media about how the world things to consumer Trends are happening was a younger generation thinking what everyone is thinking plus what you being taught versus what is the ground reality how do you implement that how do you deal with change constant change more often change all the timeYeh female feeling in MBA 50% after that you can learn and 50% in learn if there are any other advantages of the then like structure no I think it gives you some fundamental brush price is very something that very personal for people as to what they feel is lacking within themselves ok ok I think maybe when I started off with that my commercial acumen from I don't know where came about my could understand the basics of Commerce and commercial and running a business and I could I could I couldlogic and sensibility coming into a world you have been very curious my whole life so this constant curiosity get you to learn a lot more and keep your eyes and ears open because your life long no no other than upgrade what are your learning mechanism slide you talk to young people like myself I am constantly interacting with people having almost at least three to four times a month I am interacting with various people or giving a talk and that's not itselfI am giving a talk summer is a question paper that 300 people question and answer interactive session is nearly a really good Palace I think in the various fields that I am doing here from the social science of your work to upgrade to storytelling with movies in RSVP and to my spouse and I was actually for a recluse and getting so much more information is so much touch points in so much contact points that is a concern forcorrect but you also still read despite so much when in flow of information in your life yeah I do read I started reading morning last two years and have read the last 24 multiple reasons I think a because I force myself to the discipline that time there is always books for things that are outside the purview of what I am doing because then it can affect its power distraction in which part of understanding semariya the parsonage huge influence on both my voice green andTrisha working in a very large library

and daughter you need to live in the above all the impact on my life because both of them can we pass now turn X in them again however that the guts to do it yet I feel that I will have to do it and both of them in the last six to seven years of philosophy School AndersonCham 810 to access 50 hours a week in the philosopher school is not school philosophy which was all about Seva it but

a very rounded purpose in life when someone talks with kind of a little bit imposing because I feel like you've got to watch the under control like you have to get two sorted out soI want to know if you have low days if you feel low on certain days about work and at the age of at and after all experience to gain over your do you still have self doubt you still feel oh yes I think that this is a good point The Tourist self doubt I am a little less on I have to say Lo I realise that actually energy sapping is why I am getting very conscious of in a think all of us revitalizer selfwith a positive energy stocks for work life balance to get it this positive energy and fixing the positive energy to work you won't have a problem in work like to me it's not much about the law as mature enough in low of energy and that's like a straight single side panel alone time between 6 and 8 39 in the morning when I grill good time to Deuda myself where at least for now ok I read try and do 50 minutaapane which is meditation and yoga for the nice serious stuff but actually be fun stuff taking a walk but instead it was clear your mind reader Tamanna Tony Robbins call this priming like you get set for the your working hours you need to take some time to just relax think about yourself yeah I think those three working as the rest time Aam all my introduction hours I want to ask you what energy saving and introduction p r uthat there are certain factors the takeaway energy and a very high energy person so what are your conversation people can supply energy from you and that that something you need to you need to feel very aware that thought how did you realise a body is due for this only one young early-stage you can you become aware and then you figure out the having a wheel myself away from that and then you just need a doctor should I see when you're working with the people in your young Universitysometimes many times you don't have a choice even today I think in many cases one dozen other choices we don't have a choice how do you deal with that is if anyone was walking away from something is not going to be the solution at describe your coworkers your friends extended family could be anything it could be situation sometimes if we whatever it is that what specifically an example of someone at the workplace taking away energy is negative Foundation Rowdy conversation is Harsh conversation is not afraid of conversationis it that you can feel someone is talking energy from person the energy that is literally literally literally literally nothing that I felt a very young station should my lost will be about figuring out if someone is talking energy for me or am I living manager gets sucked and not sing in a budu Manna Assamese talking about me that you can feel it how you feel about this conversation I feel good about this right now and positive energyright now what's the best-case scenario for your life do you have like an end view building businesses towards that kind of angle and I tell you I'm asking for me I really desperately want right in the world in some way inventory and I know that money is one of those factors in life that definitely make you more powerful so while I am earning money through business it with that end goal of our changemaker possible without entering the world politics so what you are endgame like why you doing this I think thismaker as a word is nice it's nice definition as I am a goldposter flag post what is the process so it's never change maker in that writing today I feel fabulous about everything that I am doing I feel really blessed about what I am doing these choices that I've made ok is and I think the fact that I can make that many choices and that's what I think the younger generation also need to understand today that if you are placed an offer you can make choices that some massive plus so that stage if you start getting into depressionstarting to feel mentally challenged on certain situations just remember the choices you can make 99% of people can make the tried to that some massive message message to visit around that you have to tell me I think in the last five years and will bless have to make the choices I want to do something the not-for-profit space but it is not like I started on 7 years back after died in cash or I had enough we started doing that when I was 23 so what I am doing withI just feel really good about it because it turns me on incredible exam starting from scratch in building something really and is not impact your pilot again in order control roomwinning losing app down with Fun Cinemas Fun I want how do you say in a podcast that you should be super non emotional about all of businesses that run them but don't get emotional honestly I feel like my emotions are what drive real life become very emotional about my team family culture all that if not most about your business what kind of relation you mixing up emotions with passionshould be extremely passionate about it but you don't need to be emotional and once you figure out that there is a huge difference between those two words with arrays and you can get it from that point of cost you need to be extremely passionate emotional then you can take the sensible decisions in life is about you know it's like when you're working with people in a thought the take it personally is an emotion decision in a workplace if one person is giving feedback to the other it takes it personally it motion text in a positive manner ifwhat gets you super angry at the workplace or in life I think I suffer fools very badly so that this was not fast enough if we could be about speed records clarity sometimes I think communication is a very important tool in this new generation and just this place we want to move faster then I don't think we communicate the level at which we can communicate sometimes and tight men are sucking that sometime skinto the point current situation right so why are we see more mental health issues with this generation than yours yeah I agree I think it's question of Expectations is a question entitlement is those things that I think up a driving a lot of people and then they open up and a lot of that younger generation feels they can solve themselves on their own this is built around world around them selves and we don't have that feedback in Israeldifficult do you think its social media did think so growing up in the world of social media marketing Technologies changing I think consumers are changing the same way here no I don't think so I mean everyone has their own tools we highly depressed years back to us back 10 years back there in UP 2018 excuses for why you are getting depressed in order to prevent their long was with the whole world was a war by that time everyone should be depressed for ten years after they were youfamily was not there Shravan Katha tik situations in the past simple lehenga depression is modelled with individuals and how they want to cope with that might have you suffer from heart break at any point on automobile breakup song only I am talking about like this general heartbreaking lifeyeah 20 is all about like discovering yourself getting slapped around your slaps back in the day is actually had more than one girlfriend very nice and transparent about it but I think your heart breaks happen but I think at that stage you feel that the like the worst thing that happened to you then you may want I think today again when we talked about mentaland depression just the whole feedback think the series was the young people actually today feel that it white personal again like Assamese let you down then you feel of God and then there's something wrong with you and then you internalize that and then everything becomes inspired the take themselves too seriously do you think that also the case I guess if you are not in a stage of metal this thing you would have taken a circle is too seriously and otherwise to chill outdifficult I've also seen it have seen it live and once tried that is so much to get them out the bedroom and get them into the living room sometimes to have a conversation in a nice relaxed manner is impossible so it's scary it is very scary coming back to your marriage so how did you find the court found that you could marry or did you figure out a lot of people what they do is heard people say that I am not married yetno perspective but about people say that it's fantastic to have two people from different industries get married little do they can escape into Egypt I have actually worked together first period allowed here together and then we got lost again in terms of working with your life that those that have a tone that challenges arises if you don't take a walk home at most cases when we worked in media together we were working in different responsiblealtogether and today when we work together it's more on the social space so it's just so much passion their agendas less is not a comparative thing between two A pass come to do it because we're really deeply involved with what we want to do and frankly we don't have arguments and difference of opinion that how we can get the best of each other at right so it's a marriage bilton growth amazing on growtheffort into any relationship to make it grow into a lot of relationships other then hopefully with my wife my life because I guess that's just for me I am as I said it it takes a lot of effort to get into a personal relationship with people so even if you only had to choose between a life of business was a life of family what would you choosethink that would allow myself to be put in a position that but because I be damned if I do not want to Boss no question that it is come together and I don't know there are no such situations which are what is which had never can be Boris so it is a balance that were days but if it had to be one of the two I don't see why we need to pick either of them was your last thought when you are going to sleep meditate actually actually the my last what is my breathinglying down after the meditation where is think sometimes it could be just a random thoughts sometimes I think it is to do with work and your winding up the most horrible thing is a watching something on television or on a digital platform was the worst thing I Hospital sunaiye switch to actually reading for half an hour before and that 10 minutes meditation to actually that your best sleep sleep sleep is the biggest fuel of my lifealso in terms of what I've read a lot of spiritual books now you find yourself reading spirituality as well not that much impact both with and Trisha talking about that sometimes a lot of business lessons in spiritualitynot good morning those books that is what is different books at different times and in turn me on answer like do you yourself use upgrade for anything like to learn anything nearly at what we are getting involved in the entire process of what we doing in terms of content that because I think at the core of learning at the core of teaching in the qualification storytelling write a notice and I think thatthe most important part so anything that I also bring to the table so to the extent yes how we how we create how we do what we do is an integral part of what I want to do what jobs can you look like in 15 years because I know someone who developed upgrade with that thought bubble in your mind and weight while preparing people for like to go through three different regions in the first place I think people should be only concerned about jobs you can be the over the next five years that can determine in a I think people used to makejio plans Nagini 1 year plan into your plans and that's pretty much long term and not saying one month and two hands is there something is about every 45 years now when we get to the theoretical power of saying that the careers of tomorrow Artificial Intelligence and machine learning that all the conventional manner also there but I think the core of the jobs in tomorrow's require a lot of resilience and Allah common sense with which one do that and that's why goes back to your question to ask me your MBA degree and I'm saying yesNind a little better than knowledge but how you gonna put into practice of the jobs if tomorrow will require people to be good communicators ok in some form of the Other good storytellers ok ok that how you can get the attention write a lot of self confidence in yourself and then domain knowledge will come from time to time and cost will be the careers of tomorrow that you're looking at which is we know all about it or not here how that will impact people or period time will be step by step so but why was it importantgood communication 2004 compared to 2025 changed a lot because I think to be heard today is Focus attention and concentration and again going back to youngsters I think the other part of the mental illness is this continued form of distraction and attention span right sari Rasme today what are destruction level versus 15 years back big difference right so they need to be communicated to hold your attention because afterminutes of a conversation if I am giving a talk for for half an hour diffusivity of half an hour and I still wait ok long time back but today I say I want top 5 minutes and then everyone selling at the phone what ever and how ever deeper want to say something I tend to focus now he's just not that have used this power communication skills to forward your career you yourself years so I've used it as leverage did it is important I've updated I need to improve on it that wayBodyguard top 3 tips when it comes to communication skills it keep it simple clarity we are really keep it simple no clarity is your own internal thinking but really keep it simple eye contact is another very important devices and that's why to me that distraction comes with a human can I contact people when you communicating half with his body language not what you say how you say so much is about how are you say you take up and other people body languageyeah but not in any you should be aware of it just comes with write the vocabulary that's how it should come by bus millennials and keep it simple it's a I contact 6 may be the third one driver add to that right ukeri breakdown charming little more than just jump unassuming make people feel relaxed around youthis is a nice conversation this can be had with nothing that formula about it is a very nice people could be very boring Bakrid also very charming and then that it so when you sit on your charm doesn't mean you to do this it is a good one meaning by such that each with their people Java modulationbut they again you mentioned artificial intelligence you mentioned machine learning something like that are the things really going to steal peoples jobs especially in the great jobs in Delhi steel jobs of this Le now every single technological update that I think the keep challenge for most people today is how they gonna keep it and what I think in India are main challenges in the beginning we were noneShashikant me right in the middle class family court form with it and IT industry which are doing today is changing the younger generation the can relate to that what they knew it industry and that's how he created mil class 9 today India news to step out of this caused leverage point of view Army China that a lot Indians to step out this cost leverage arbitrage point to be a break that done a lot to simplify that something cost leverage meaning today weibo weiboanother country write a me where country where people come to us and we will do something at a cheaper price got it that is stop which means that we need to create originality we need to be creators and not just job handless right I think that's a good father and excited about the younger generation is not done more necessary to go out and just execute it in the younger generation a lot more than that will lead to creativity the lead to innovation that will need to doing something newthey'll need to say no to a lot of things not take me now I think that's that can Road we need to Argon is there a serious possibility of India becoming on the world's richest Nations by the year 2014 I think we have Complex situations and we should set good goals and the fact is a 1.3 billion If you can get a consumption up yes but we were lost To Chalun border in the consumption of If Everyone gets more money in the pocket and they consume just 1.3consuming events fraction more can get us technically to being a good economy but I think about many problems with the haves and the have nots is used in this country and I know that we work in rural India lot and at 600 million people and more surrounded by those people who have again become a complex in life what can these changemakers do in order to make the 22040 Prema possibilityright now how can you set up India the future AC majak inspire is one of them tourism Siri having this conversation is used am happy to be in whatever small where I can see whether I can inspire talk about Astoria talk talk about something which makes you feel human is reality could do it so can I get inspired is a very very important one of the many leaders and leading from the front for what we want to do and I think this whole context of even when you're giving back and understanding the ecosystem around youwhat is impact on our country India impact is important so what we have what your doing in which we feel your doing in was impact your making some people's lives in a different manner yes fashion may not be as impactful as we would look at it but if that brings about level of confidence in people who are you doing something right thank you that something validation rule but I feel that inspiration motivationDr BR Ambedkar inspiration is that but inspiration banaa them today have you had your lifeone outs but burns and downs but downs maybe because I am also someone who recharge is quite well recharge quite what you do sleep frankly to be honest I don't take it I don't take the sleep I think that's very fortunate that I don't like taking good short breaks it actually recharge you in many ways write another something that really bother me that I'd rather drawI want to come back to the after 2-3 days to do I asked your protection Sid Roy Kapoor this question as to the same question have the winning moment in your career where in private and closed doors have you are broken down again it ride a body or something related your career absolutely that's because sometimes when your first generation and I think thethere are a lot of momos II new town but you need to keep your shoulders up now that has to have a reaction outside a when you are some stage you need to drop the shoulders in a moment of being so store 100 bravado out in front of people in the field and then you right now it's the pressure of leadership AR and OD means so I think I'm at that stated on 27 June 27 the sale if we had hack but is my life hackwhat a lot of Nike advertisement me backup motivational ads police I have a few but have you had thiswho pulled out of dark emotional places like stories of them more stories from final liberating I don't in the dark place will have not got into the dark space is going to enjoyed listening answer to why you in sports of which of these positive playback in school or college S in SO2 that extent why were done that I think that's the beauty of the transition of what you wanna do right am in you can be confident you too many things I do todaythat's quite important than a lot for the younger generation also where is like that follow follow follow what you want to do when you scan your entire career could you are done something to make everything grow faster I am I am just not a believer in hindsight I just don't think it is a waste of time because if you are se but 5 years back if I could have done this there are so many other things at that moment that would have changed around you that I think it's thereIske Billi theoretical what is a 16 year old Ronnie screwvala have the $40 is Google I didn't know when I turn 60 M right now 40 years of your choice choices I think in the last ten yearI been liberated enough to feel I can do things I think what is given me the power of no no things which is important in life I think have had that experience to be able to now say no to more things are not right that makes a big difference and giving us to this interview but coming back to the future of the education system in India at Inc generations of first generation that had the blackof social media a lot of my contact also has been centred around the Indian education system because while I was in a while I was in Engineering College and entered and enjoyed this is this information entering into my head directly I won't be able to design robots and planes your enter engineering that intention when they got into Engineering College they showed me and circuits that I'm your baby has one of these 10 in the example below and how to draw these have no explanation of the circuit nothing YouTubeRatta Maar of the circuit is very frustrating for young kids first generation at social media once I got begin to tell the story you know on my channel thread what is the future of the Indian education system with least I think that would be focused on an upgrade that is mean everything is bad I think its and it's not broken but it needs to get to the next level and that's because the Expectations of what you need to do in your life so so sofriends a virtual learning and getting educator for is no real connection and those fundamentals and foundations are two fundamental into Foundation oriented and I remember when I walked into acting as a very focus student in school write the first 15 days a walk to the college and I can a lost interest is assembly for so drop in the level of teaching and its relevance to what I want to do in life I walked in writing and management class in commerce in the first professor Thor ragnarokwhat is management this is what is management management and T is the tea break and laughter is only ok nobody laughter is and I was the day I fell for maybe I'm not enough to figure out how to buy my attendance in college with I am not coming you too many more these lectures here especially on to something I want so if I take that is the best example today if you're looking at education for its a very high polluted work because it sounds like it's a calendar event it soundsaap to go to school and this collagen is over it is never over I think that's pretty much what excites me about what you're doing a brand that it's really lifelong and I don't mean it Nani hyperbole is tested it is a process and therefore is not an event anymore it's about an ongoing process due sometime look at young kids of today and these kids are kind of head of my generation already there are there faster just smarter faster overopinionated in a good manner mostly in a good manner and even if its opinion Badman is good because a level of confidence when your period is is big absolutely I love to live in this generation you're working with a lot of young people here so I am sure you have exam superstars in your face like some young superstars liya how do you bracket that superstars in your own mind how do you like this guy I think it will do something that is life do what was it is clear that you'd think the first thing isshould we can see the attitude than you know where is what is it what is the attitude attitude to get it done come what may also be confident attitude or it's just that level of clarity Baras attitude no no no Jugaad is not a good thing as far as I'm concerned with regard in India means shortcuts to locate Jugaad is not like this frugal innovation the located the shortcut like Jugaad kar diya that's actually not good mis mis use this word Jugaadcompany incorporation of people who execute on the thoughts that lie for me it would be but execution is a verb attitude is a noun in that sense we know I'm saying it I still think if you got that attitude you can we learn in life and when you spot a superstar with attitude what you are rise to him I just take the Manga Miami then I say in her work together we're gonna do things that have you actually know you're looking for advice I think if I had to goin my life do not that many moments in which my best mentoring came from people give me advice on the best at inputs I got one people are still very hard questions should I am really looking for somebody who's a good attitude I think it's about asking the right hard questions or had the right ask that question an idea of what my team and myself like what we do this I want to ask you for a bit of advice for a slight mentor live on theonline only see all of the mentoring we got until now I was a lot but a few people are always told you doing too many things but honestly we believe that we going at the correct place with all those many Punjabi have the right people in place so one would you say the same thing and if not then what would you advise me if I had to do as much should have said that I am not good hands I will find something a little bit differently the one thing I would do is Focus there isso so that half answers your question I right now I still do multitasking Brad chosen through multitasking is not doing any one thing is they got phenomenal teams and colleagues around me when I am part of the process and not the only one from that point of view crys so simple answer is yes we can figure out that focus is you should actually get more valuable as you go forward with the timing for in my opinion I think sometimes you need to be in things to get you thewhat's the outbreak so just focus on one single situation may not be the best thing in a manner what are you doing is all under one roof in terms of the activities is diverse activities of the same month as long as you understand the diverse activities were the causes the same you get somewhere but if you look at each of these in the restart I heard you earlier on you talk in private saying that I found this company in a form that company I will say for those things you need to watch out for keep it under an umbrellaand then block them is diverse activities that come to the similar goal but I would not undermine focus today for real success because I think today more than ever we have more options than any other generation age but any other piece of advice or like I just while while I have access to I really want this really pick your brains on advisor will give you is actually is very different anybody to give you advice don't stand around and start taking it because then willcan you mind God so as I said to me the best advice American Ashu strong question 11 tell you whether you're a writer on analysis of what is a you want to nrc 5 mark questions and then you might feel for the help that just ask me a question and answer 5 mark questions but they after tomorrow those five questions will sticker on your mind are you say I didn't quite answer that right HD wale meant to say was this and then you got the answer people who are dealing with failure right now what's your biggest piece of advice it can bestock specific what curry or failure to launch of business completely Bond and so what is your next piece of advice that show what we need is going to some different things a bomb was from your gonna feel 17 times in 400 time to failure today of course in trillions of cost you would not depends on what you call failure if you can I think when I wrote my book we call failure full stop the your dad lookup failure as a comma your finewhich learning it may be therapeutic it may be whatever they need to be but it's not the end the world and we were so what's your biggest fear I am saying is yet to come and in the 2021 you think of possible business opportunities for people as and like Howard promise in the 2010 social media advisor capitalised on it because I saw that Facebook is coming out they will obviously be a requirement of influences 2020 what's it gonna beI think if you look at India versus on the Global market area as a separate one I think was so underwear and when it comes to health ok and Wellness ok this whole evolution of people and you know and you can be young and it 18 + thinking of with very different manners I just think the whole element of health Wellness is a massive sector disrupting the whole at x factor which were doing in education is no longer education rights that like a massive officialdozing IOC or when you're looking at some other incredible opportunities and then I think for a country like in their the impact elements what we do in some of the business of a tree is secured to the right thing the kind of most useful thing is about social media and saying the 40 people who had an FYI normal thing in waste in waste management you will have their story is because this intention sexy refund is it get to the front page but incredible stories incredible stories a goodships would struggle lots of failure and actually doing family business do you have any business tips right now for those people can start the business is in the twenties in the need to keep in mind that specific to this decade I think you're all that is if you figure out why you need to be very clear about what are you doing what you're doing that's very important purpose yeah I think you need to have that very clear I have no choice in positive attitude if you think I'm saying I'll give this one year and sewerdon't because the chances are I won't happen in the year you can't time it and then you get screwed so don't do that don't put some of those preconditions baby wont start even be a professional employment start a business or you want to take a job at above 18 May be declared on those with a graphical how are you say that this is your biggest project till date that I am this consists of the most what is like your maximum potential scenario for grad like the oneable to make sure that every kid in India every human in India is no I think I am I did say very clearly I think India's cable laying the teaching capital of the world ok I think Technology wise enough of asking the cost of the try guys we will come to us for being the low cost model we can innovate anything in this field of Health and education the whole world is a path is not like any nation is 5 years ahead 15 years there in 20 years which it is a many other aspects and I think that's why it's a phenomenal locker yourmimicking the idea of Nalanda and Takshila the ancient universities were people who have flocked India but why we work in schools in it and there in an infrastructure with the school's I think the best learning that had been the come out 603 in a circle and I think that is what the Indian philosophy was an education the British came instead of an Avenue to go back to yourbig event original countries with the want to talk to the rural population due feel that way want to come out of rural India now she looked at Swades be created by 100 mm and every year in cashew in Gotri in poultry in many aspects to find there is not about is above the level of confidence and their level of ambition that thing in in rural India people haven't really figure outto have money in your pocket what can do for you 70 years if you only lived on the grounds that is it difficult to understand what what life can be which is right different sorting out the corner but we do there is to also working as Pareshan levels and emission levels of these again the key is inspire them would like pick up where inspire our inspire a beautiful and just last question of this podcast what your three greatest learning of life had the defensive back newbusiness 18 just beyond life in general I have a strong philosophy that all Glory is fleeting and spirit rich women in saree very early in my life don't get attached with trees and people actually excuse me therefore I am not celebrating small successes in Big successes in a move on but I just feel ok if something was fantastic that they move on because the next day I could be something very different is good and bad for the people work around me is not the best thing but where I come rechargesomething that is one thing that there the second one is this whole context of not having a choice I think that's demeterali my failures verify go on anything else knows about choice to have a plan B then it becomes a problem sending that's pretty much was also given me the opportunity I don't have a choice let's get on with it otherwise you start looking for a very easily with anything is also given me and the third learningStuart hall in one last question few and a lot sq which is a spiritual quotient in your emotional and spiritual quotient and encapsulated everything from this quote from the Bible called Philippians 4 13 so it says that I can do all things through him to give me strength where anything that you are complex is actually the universethrough all this was upgraded meant to happen Swades is meant happier you are just the medium where are you believe in that I think if there is one word in my vocabulary today it's Randhawa t in it is plain that for the excellent it means a lot of people think it's in the right place at the right time but there is no such thing like that that was you need to know because you need to work at it sounds like you can sit and some reason I hate you fromwhat happened for YouTube in the right place right time in your work very hard to be multiple places and multiple times for the one or two opportunities why you're in the right place right time setting everything that happened for me the last 78 years is completely different fishes do you think about God I believe in God and I think it's always good pass is divisible why are there in the modern young generation at an answerwhy am I think maybe they sometimes it comes from personal experience sometimes it's frozen from your believes I think today people feel the lot more in control of themselves were actually than not that gives you the power to believe that Actually that's what are the days and I think people change people grow with custom and then as you grow up user also sometimes you can't change what role does God played in your career aroundaround the point of when he scored a century no I have been pointed up a noticeable uptown whatever else but just been around it will be the one I am I thought it could be pulling my dear brother and when to take this is your 3rd lesson of life and thankyou thankyou was good fun I can you never give up something

and I feel generally audience on this particular podcast is very incline towards self helpself improvement of self help or self improvement as concept has had of Mind Valley for what I wanna take you back is to 2003 and pre 2003 again I am completely familiar with what happened in a podcast with Jay Shetty you spoke about and I was experience you had and how you kind of just knew that you had to create mind value in life and white dial you even further back into your teenage you kind of 40 on periodsecurities and the older version of yourself through a concept like meditation for someone who is completely embraced you know these in India with college Hatke with a slightly alternative mindsets to change yourself your company and then the world through your work so could you could you

teachers in stages in Mistakes of the world ranging from India to China 2222 the Middle East and speaking about the generations we educate phone numbereducation has to do with the idea of educating people to expand their levels of compassion the greater and greater degrees of wholeness in 1872 Charles Darwin predicted that main time is going to start becoming more more more unified pieces or become self evident that strives for unite to become Nations with the nationmight become Union of Nations and unions of nations for continuous lighting and tell me have a centred identity he called it the fusion of sympathy and he said this is just wear human beings are going to go Ken wilber a hundred years later said this is one of the most important things we can educate people most human beings ok are but you call the ethnocentric level existence 70% of human beings are ethnocentric they believe andwonderful amazing that with people of the same colour religion ethnicity or nationality this is the illusion of the educated forward centric identity why is it that growing up in Indian family and Sindhi ok so that might mystery I am in the growing up and my grandfather was wonderful men super kind super generous but he exited the ethnocentric lableproperty would have been very disappointed with me about marrying someone who was a bit darker Indian skin tone and tenor and Aryan and an example of a completely different ways and remember the members of my family at bus stand Rick stein awesome smart people who were upset with them because how there I marry someone outside the right religion in the white race this is temperature in exist in the world todaythe population is there and this is what we have to educate human beings to move beyond we have the more people to what is called centrism we'll send you some is where you basically understand that colour is simply a function of melon in the skin that village in his beautiful but over Legend happy Papa fruit Eeco car brochure and that National borders are arbitrary and random Sindh which is the part that my grandfather1939 what's done is done before 1857 between 1850 in 1947 and Pakistan in 1947 what the hell am I so so so cast in stone and that is where things get Mr educator go to words words and vocabulary with their celebrity on world itself BBC human beingF1 display on because the planet is going through enough people right now global warming is going to the fundamental damaging to our species we need to educate what is call Cosmos tantric identity and this means that we become human beings who seek to be one with nature in scientific terms to create a Civilization that is not possible to nature for every year human beings are on the planetplanet is getting better and better and better and better than three times the Biomass of human beings get for every year and second the planet planet gets better we select the planet that the second paper Nov 3rd CA the most interesting if you Indian it is cheap or access all the states experience the great Indian mistakes knew that they knew that we are not just waking consciousness there is a feeling of Onenessexperience experience is Lucid dreams as out of body experience just you need to teach people the axis of the state's event in iOS area plant medicine is 11 mean but not the most occasion when you bring these things together Mushkil and intelligence moving towards Cosmos and system with this species Centre identity and then all the states in existence going within now you have education and that's just the startthis is what mind are you doing so I have a couple of questions specifically speaking about education firstly as a species what do you think is the next stage of evolution because in a lot of intellectual of the world are talking about how we still evolving when not this isn't a final form evolving into something else and very likely that with advancements in technology with information being displayed out within an evolving into a new version of ourselvesSudha the first question that way you think we're going as a species and the second hand like to ask you is again this is a very Indian perspective but Indians like to know how your product is going to actually add value to their life in terms of only money like I am and I understand I hear you completely but do you think that the skills that you speak of will make you a better professional will it only of atom pay package will it give you better Business appsanswer the very easy one species evolving I just get your clue where born into the common species that is going to be embracing multiple lines intelligence the artist is as important as IT Engineer yeah I drop in Indian family it in the Kamal lawyer engineer entrepreneur you became a family tailor this thinking this occupation that this occupation because so manynecessary and infinite power was watching in Indian movie last night 3 Idiots in our stars like laughing my as often as looking at like all the things that happened in Indian Engineering school so I get that because I came from that culture I became an engineer because my parents wanted to be an engineer I became an

it now when the things you doing right now if we are bringing entrepreneurship training in my just announced on Friday and because We're expanding the India many of the earth by bringing on board a Indian LegendsIndia Indian ethnic wear for example Naveen Jain to just became the first private citizens get permission to Land Rover on the Moon Navin grew up in a village in India you went on to go to America with Microsoft and started several billion dollar companies if treated all of whom I graduate from avidly Ivy League Universities and vitarit incredible NGOs Naveen Jain has never been changed program is on my mindpeople dream big but you trimbake know how do you execute a new program is with Mickey Agarwal Wiki advocate in Indian women in Canada who started 200 million dollar companies started a woman's underweight company called things she started at the day company and now with the mother she started a diaper company of buffer biodegradable diaper supporting 1GB her third hundred million dollar companydouble hundred million dollar company you want to learn from Student to teach on mind and then determined at making company acquired property if you take Naveen Jain cosmic 30 cos to check my cost you can be the wealthier than it would be because you learn from people who have done it before not from professor University of never give up never mind I'll also within a better source of utilitywhat did you other students we call it deals with you decide that branding is haunted places you want to learn and then say let se winding is another skill you are plugged into girls with other brand experts other Riders and we are building a brain to brain interface will you get the multiplier it doesn't have that some other offences that this could be a module in the next one year any graduate from mind Valley has access to more rain power2customer brain to brain connection utilitycan a graduate from regular University with that some advanced tactics coming tends to the right of exponential Technologies so you know I have two questions ask you on a very personal level the first is a personal question which is something as all my guess because this podcast is a reflection of my evolution as a person as well as the first question is I constantly feel a bit too hungry for moreand I don't know where they draw that line in terms of settling for where I am and just being at peace with whatever chief to Now versus time always wanting more and I am sure you watch the last dance of Michael Jordan so that message that while it does give you a lot of motivation like as a young twenty something man it does a lot of harm to your mind set as well so I see the same thing I feel like you're gone the same journey that I am on right now so how did you overcome that was Kasam did show you theasking you know my personal level and second thing is the topic you spoke about a lot with Jay Shetty which is the intuitive netted love for you to expand that can I do feel like these two questions are link but I will let you take over so you think you can she was mituba questions let's let's go the first one first about how do you know when hunger can actually cause more harm than do you goodsuperstar talk about what you mean by hunger write what I take the lead your saying is Desire is Desire it's one thing is it is clear that you want to do more you want to accomplish more you want to get more is this correct I want to do more that I won't be able to create all the products that I can visualise in my head with a novel visualising the winner will be able to do the next 10 years by want to do it sooner than ten years ok so let's go back to thatvideo raksamgre ok to understand what I'm going to go with this you have to understand the concept of self talk about anger do you always keep me in your hungry yah you are many many more hungry good thing I don't understand it is there are 6 types of Sanga Sanga in the body parts of Hunger connectivity a Bio physical response when your body needs water causing the oldest water was very big of water from fruit so if I drinkthat might stop your hunger on the cross abbaiah nutrition of Hunger in India have been eating nutritional food you can eating junk do you need some nutrition hunger could also be just a normal response that your stomach is empty we're not trying to recognise that our stomach is empty and so people regard of Delhi that's a bad thing so that is actually a good means of your stomach is empty or have to do anything for you actually get educated and hungry and interesting enough mandali educate people recognise 67 types ofresponsebody correctly when you educate that you understand that there is an illusion human beings simplify a complex world into words will you give all of these six different reactions that your stomach is having a new column all funga you don't know what to do when you differentiate into the nutritional hunger empty stomach actual underwear you are Starving rightyou know the right action to take this even such a thing as emotional sangrah where you feel hungry when you getting through a discount with emotion you can at least of that through meditation and that feeling this appears to karo recognise the period to win your case we have to first look at what you mean by hunger and Break It Down we mean by Desire and break it down and there are multiple forms of Desire that is either way you want something and you till it's hard to get a new people in BSEshort summary of hashtag in YouTube that it the type of one thing that you want to go away but there's this way you want something and you know your gonna get it and you want it because it's going to be phenomenal for you the desire for money desire for the expense of ka that's not bad but sometimes it's mein asking something else for example be expensive car could be because you need us informed like self identity yoursexample driver $300 bicycle I have no desire desire to go for initial the word of the desire to serve humanity it is desired that enough to tell someone to be a monk ought to be a billionaire to sirf humanity that is probably one of the best phones of desire to the question is what is your hunger the third one for sure the third one but it110 you're on the right track now if you have the third form of fungi which I do with Naveen Jain hai dost which Nidhi Agarwal that we met yesterday 300 million dollar companies if the same hunger that push someone like Jay study permit it is desired to sir your on the right track and that is the best form of fungus her but you are sitting in my book the good and the bad explain that always need to be concerned this to occurBuddha and the baddest the barriers is the destructor the annabelle the person who want to change the world that is phenomenal with your words to embrace your inner border your inner pura is your spiritual and if you don't in ratio in a Budha the bad as contractual you could would you can you get screwed up your credibility is because you're not getting enough sleep you are not exercising value not taking care of your health but if you aresolid in your inner border and you are also using some of the Other spiritual Tu to such as being able to use the power of your mind to to to to manifest to such as insulation to such as being able to align with higher intelligence to get the right guidance now you move towards your desired with is and eventually you move towards your desired with such is that they no longer a Desire that never DelhiKeno was coming this is the highest form of manifesting expectancy you just know what's coming to speak so quantity of Mind I'll be the most important education company in the world because I just know what's coming there is no no I don't have read right now and take care my body so the Greek freak when there is to take his Desire that you have a moving towards success propoundedsee the inevitable now this is what spiritual teacher sometimes called being in a state of surrender value in that state of surrender you just know it's coming in you operate in a different way now we can go want to wider words that are caused the problem was the most impactful podcast I had the same spoken about that podcast on many episodes of this particular podcast andI am in adjust it shifted things in my own head for me as exercise applying a couple of the things you spoke about beard manifestation beard being conscious of the integrative net so while I wish to speak to a lot about my personal questions on that front baby let the answer that into it is NET question first letter explaining to this Ordinance because it can be a society Deepa concept that what people are expecting so let go for that and then I'll take you had ok so firstly the breeze in the for class 1set a podcast with the best podcast that is validation to what I'm saying what you experience on the Potter's was initially interview with me Jaise breakfast Ram Jay Leti Govind speak about what mind values during any depth of tube that evidence that everyone listen to this right now Schedule reminder B.Com and become a member and enroll in a University ok so I just want to point out that that was the taste of the mind Valley philosophy and the mind value way of using the British reminder B.ComTata Indica member and soon everyone who joined from India can be put in a private Indian Social Network and we're gonna be amplified dataligence connecting them with other people in India even introducing them to a predictive algorithms to potential allies rem jem Barbie's even the person you might fall in love with so that we are going with all of that control very fast and you can see more Indian teachers come on my heart Riya meinBarbie Shankar ka test match Great wisdom in India on hill in potentially Sadguru was well aware currently in talks to a lawyer banne Singh Indian teachers Indian entrepreneurs and so want ok now let's go back to the question on insulation is at what you like me the address yes we integration in your intuitive net that you spoke of ok so I believe that Polymers have test this power of insulationthe modern world richest ignoring so does a new field of Sciences fall perceptual diversity that anthropologists use perceptual diversity is when you please see the world through a diverse set of input not just your eyes for your years old your fingertips perceptual diversity according to an anthropologist Bhogi new in 1973 paper 90%at some point of the chapter diversity if you go back into the roots of Indian Culture new look at meditation prayer all of the perceptual diversity if you read the book autobiography of a yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda he talks about these instances with insight would come to him where he would see apparitions he talks about how the sages communicator this is all the staff told I was it was beyond the physical senses but as the world goes Moin Moin MoinVaishnav is a backlash to which religion with the promised in our village Industries UP sometimes available because there's a lot of nonsense in religion we end up saying that anything that cannot be explained by science is rubbish and that's why we had our staffs insulation is not real turns out not only is it real that science in the last 20 years is valid in it moreexample the University of Edinburgh it was called The gangster experiments and would take to people and people in the room one person would be put into a meditative state using what is called a sensory deprivation chamber basically upload time right cloth and their depth of field will you turn off all your senses like you're going to get into the state the other person is in the room where is watching Yoshi watching television screen the show youOppo images it could be horses running through a stream it could be an image of a water on landscape it to be an image with gorgeous building Imagine Apple on a table now didn't wake up the person who is the sensory deprivation chamber show the person that both images India like what to the other person in the room look at now if you think your rational and being rude in Probability what are the odds that a person who was woken up with just the rightconstructing a situation 225 ok different computer studies with email on train subject the actual or was 33% 33% of that is pretty interesting that shows billion to warn that insulation is real life 171 something is going on but again it was 100% either so in short insulation is real it's not you it's not visibleincrease the odds venue for business proposal you feel something of that to be your insulation if you are going on a date with someone for the first time you feel something of that to be your insulation but maybe you also feel something like that your intuition and so we have to learn to discern the you get really good inspiration you what happens if you are able to bring in an additional faculty to toyour intelligence this is where the magic happens in water I sections book on Steve Jobs in a week in job because it would be the British Council paneer covid-19 write a person and to the program dollar company jobs believe in Prana p r a j and a Peninsula understanding of the world jobs in produced this concept during his travels to India sure you get the story of Steve Jobs that across India with damage what is brandsection set IT jobs Lee was so imagine that they were not having put your intellect he called It Like A beautifully over genius magician and that is what information does the patient undergoing right now for mind Delhi a large at that position I spoke about connecting all the people in India are being able to predict which can be your friends that mission came to me in a 7 our trip on Oscarthen I will find that using this album is that which is the most advanced after take meditation programs in my daddy refining it could in all the pieces together and then be raised a large sum on it and now we're building products by going deep into my intubation and an understanding what the universe want me to deliver the water and then I trust my going to that everything in a state of surrender everything close Lo asali towards the outcome this is how I know mythe most advanced education curriculum in the world Universe has your back universal ditinus everything is moving towards Disco because it's Nobel it's good it can change your memory and moving towards becoming a true Cosmos entry centric society that anyone can do that everyone you are not want to change the world maybe you have a book that your dying to get out maybe you have a podcast Idea maybe you are trying to change the way your business runs you gotta learnAmin fruit question but is there any moment now why you meet any form of stress in your mind if you seem like I mean I feel you like your very divinely guided person I feel like you know you've landed on the right place at the right time so gain from the outside it seems like your kind of a train which is on the very sturdy stable railway track so it would be hard for meYour mental peace gets taken up at all the really very just you don't completely eliminate stress so for example if your crossing the road for controlling a busy in love with your own or whatever your mind someone always on in a bus is like this closed you want your body to create a stress response are you jump at the way you don't want to eliminate stress it was written to kill you press the safety response to what happens in the world today is that we get stress for nonsituations ok you don't know why it will use the business deals for Innova working with someone and they are stressed about something that happened with your family and a snap at you and then you get stressed you are not going to die you not in any harm's way the response to what happens in your body is biochemical respond to dukan Train Your the way your brain respond to it so you don't hurt yourself because that's where I can get you deliver the weight of a moving bus it was too slowly kills your bodydamaging effect on your body and so the less stress along the unit trust for example showing telomere length which is one of the other the ko biomarkers so you can bring that was not know how we do it in mind that yes of course meditation is a great way to know when using a neutral bike or mechanically produce the program on my value call everyday Play Store silver mine Bali members in your account and develop a form of hypnotic Trance audio that program surecontest deal with stress in a different way I am finding right now it is I am I am I want a stick to the program it to anyone day programme on finding that when I sleep can I measure my my heart rate variability which is another matter of Trust am Sydney so much more Kaun right and so you can subconsciously bring your way to become resistant to stress using these types of Technology base level you are married you want to go with them to use someepidermis my mind to your subconscious to change your physiological response to stress for your always particular column in non threatening situations with your still love you know it 7 runs with you with a knife or the best is growing industry and coming back to your Indian routes as well as your Global entrepreneur when you are within your mind I'm gonna ask the questionthese two versions of the same how do you look at India how you look at the future of India what do you think India's role is going to be on the world stage going forward because this has been a cultural hub for the world for centuries now and I feel like we had a bit depth the last two under $300 in terms of Bihar cultural hundred numbers to back that where are the GDP of the country 200 to 50 years back was bigger than the GDP of all of your put together and we were reduced to likelowest in the world right after we got independence but I feel the bouncing back especially over the next 20 30 40 years especially the biggest businessman in this country believe so so I am asking you from a very objective perspective while I know your roots are based in this country you seen the rest of the world is spoken in global entrepreneurs where do you think our country is going animals again request you to grant of dive into your own intuition and answer this question write the unit in our Indiais that it fits it is one country but in the US like your up you go to Tamilnadu you go to Punjab you go to to to what remains of Sindh in India and its different as Germany and Belgium and Estonia so India so different state by State region by region it is a beautiful Omega and now the nation 816 different dialects and so there is no 1 India does a multitude of Indiaanswer that question I can cause I am I move toward the Cosmos centric world you in other words I appreciate my Indian routes to appreciate a strategy that American beside me that simulation beside me that's estonian I am a member of first my Indian DNA is secondary and so I love India I don't know win the more than I love Pakistan oval of ChinaI love you ok I want to see all of humanity and why the great appreciation for my Indian route that only last night was watching in Indian movie by myself laughing my my my my face of the possible so good periods and and I was just so so I just love seeing Indian that movie that their flight time why separation that prevented from AC with me answering your question with true knowledgeatago India and discover that country in USA changing so that right I mean and I feel like I know I feel like a lot of the mind Valley concepts wisdom there are parallels with ancient yogic culture from this country as well as you were noticed something very unique in mind you will notice a huge amount of Indian pacers online now there's a reason for that reason for that finallyparty props and American Indian faces from me to Srikumar Rao to Naveen Jain to Tumi Ki Agrawal India for testers more Indian pacers coming in the reason for that is because there is a Desire in me to show that Indians can be extraordinary individuals we just the fitness program we feature a picture of Kumaon Engineering in the Indian actorbike tank sticker Maa like Indian men known as longest penistopic on this particular podcast keep talking about that book but if you had to reference other reading material you know people too kind of just open up to these possibilities in this kind of

eventually life very interesting story and for young people it it it might be interesting How you change something that negative into a positive the ok I was very young I was in Kashmir my elder brother Ramanand Sagar my half-brother that time was making fun call you ok and I was in school my father wasnot so well to do so I was in a school call DAV School and I both are key maker in blue shirt and when excited and I took my friends are show you the shooting of my brother and I went and it was little awkward because I wasn't really rest well I figured that actually I wasn't welcome on the said and I was very young and I said one day I'll make films and show you so actually speakthe reason I became a filmmaker was very very negative it started with a very very negative thought that I will show you what I can do if I change that into something that I really want to do and you know how most of Asian people I saw your the little thing you should me up there and it's that if somebody tell your fat boy in fixit you know by working out if somebody tell your Dumsmart enough to make that guys so how you changed and in its a negative thing that happens to you into something that's fantastic that's what I did so why I am telling you this very personal thing is for young kids watching this Tu To really try and understand that you can become what you want to become on your terms and this office at Ranveer just looked around that looks like a meditation chamber is an officerules that would ever be done whether it's Lage Raho Munna Bhai brothers pk brothers 3 Idiots whatever we have done we have believed that will writing some when all your films we do see the same model you know that wasn't saying of you want an arrow to go forward pull it back up bed first year so I think that can capsule is that whole idea I want to ask you for seeing this whole of a space I feel like one is a lot of Creative energy generally here I am sorry when the wave selected teamcreative team and usually what I see with creative professionals we have it sometimes difficult to teach them how to monetize their craft how to make money of creativity that I want to ask you that same question for you been like to write a director producer we enacted and you're gone and a monitor is that whole process in main money of demeter Kari of it so what that one piece of advice are you have become the monitor using the earth with a very relevant think today you know I haveTata Birla Ranveer ok I've always pursuing my heart talking and its monitise itself because the moment you start thinking a monitoring your at your bastardization but advising it whatever they are because you can't do that you have to say this is what I want to do I will do to the best of my ability and let me tell you it monitors itself I am living example that speaking about you I wanna go backStory movie made call Khamoshiyan and it was the first movie made of this Studio less and I read the plot of the movie are not seen it yet very complex plot you want able to sell it to any distributor just didn't buy and sell everybody price that nobody got it and everybody Avinash Chopra said it's

and while walkingTata Roadies DU believe in this one so much why don't you release it it was a damn thing to say how can I release a phone I said but how can I release it why not that I thought about that what I did was completely crazy I hired 1 cinema Regal because it was then owner I showed in the film he liked it one cinema I put the holding that time you stupid Holdings I had it and putI was the distributor which means that if I would not be able to give nfdc 8 lakh Sloan I would be that because my bank balance was not even 8000 rupees ok De 1B Renu Saluja Vinod Pradhan my cameraman we

I want to ask you this one kind of personal question please do personally for me on a personal level a lot of the things I do not carry on the lyrics of Persia given my own words for my mother is there a similar emotion for you in this field for this film is for me everything that this whole sale my did for my mother because when she died in 2007 and she can go back to Kashmir she told me ke Hosa get them better film Banai so in 2008 I start writing this is this I would have made this for me if she wasn'tso it is really made for her so what is water she is spoken to about the incidents everything because I was grown up I know everything everything she said in the film everything she experiences in the will actually her name is Shanti Devi and the character in the film Saathiya who plays is called Shanti so the film is really in a way her life and what we all went through and think about it just think about it when you stayDadar to imagine kar in Dadar you wake up tomorrow and

myselfand you just like to be that created absolutely nothing else this this is that the creative adult is the child that survived do you agree with that I am surviving on an inner child inside that I also feel that all create a professional some where a slightly spiritually inclined so that I am I hopelisten to this and I hope they will learn from experience but I do every morning I wake up around

the world I know you kind of animal opted inside the movie somewhere I am sure knowing you but something you can see on the spot cast as well because I feel I will mothers are some of the world's greatest blessing piano lesson is in the in the film if you see her house was gone it was lost everythingNTSE and she's having The Neighbours From all communities and to me I can I don't know whether we can do that anymore and that's a great lesson that she gave everything everyone forgiveness yes as you tend to move on to move on and we cannot put people in one category I cannot say everybody

Vinod Chopra bahut harami hai isliye Sab Hindu Harami has terrible can you do that how can you take an individual who made done something wrong and then generalisation se everybody by the name of Vidhu Vinod Chopra is attachedaur bye bye your name recipes that you have to see that what I learnt from my mother it was amazing for me I can I don't think I can be as great as I have anger and I get to you know but but she told me she kept saying in the documentary theek hai Joya so glad to get Ok that move on seeing is always in feeling your energy input is in a highly doubt that if someone gets angry often used not know how you come down with time my wife 25 is very calm but what's theyou think that when you're in a relationship with someone you can emerge into the same person every time I used to get angry sheet talk to me for a day or two so I can't get angry service like I am train now to to hold my hand but not given that angry are used as a young man I get disappointed and yes I get angry I shout out but for the right reasons it genuinely believe that actors directors and writers are some of the most romantic people in the worldbecause they have to kind of delve into a world of Rome and often for the world could you like just give us a quick kind of version of your love story with Anubhav am like what is this is this is my third marriage I married Renu Saluja FIR Din

over the last 20 years cases the various risk of getting this mental in a matter of months when we shut down we had about 3900 people working for intracellular directly so it was it was really horrible but I just tired to tell people as honesty and clean the as possible that look you now as of now I can't really do much when thingstake all of you backwards into much for you guys and I think people appreciate the honesty and it was horrible to be the bearer of such terrible news but I think that the support in the love I got from my people was really really hard for me to give me a lot of strengthMr Riyaz amlani how is going going going with you how does it feel to be the one of the most iconic restaurant is in the country and dancing iconic because when I was in Engineering college I thought I want and Entrepreneurship I love food I love drinks that combine all of that lets try becoming restaurant OLX model myself on mystery as amlani that I thought how does it feel to be like that right now the Lordfmb on terminologies used in general really look up to you thank youiconic there was Rahul aapke who was doing some amazing things and not just to work now share the same room with them used at still is a tree in a sense that we always are inspired by those who came before us and show you know I want to know everything about your story but will get to that later I need to ask you about the big question everyone heads is a lot of Businessman watching thiswhat is happening in the f&b industry in the restaurant industry we all know you guys are taken like a massive hit and every single ontap 9 in every single Industries looking at the restaurant industry and trying to learn lessons so can you just take us through what happened since the beginning of covid-19 till now just what I are solutions for the whole situation you do we are we are the restaurant business and a lot of times you have to really questionwhat what is the business I am in and what is exactly the restaurant business is based on business a business of actually seeing people you know the first and second vs buffalo called upon the morning is not really about food that it's about his about the people is about the people walk inside your restaurant is about how your restaurant makes them feel is about how aap what why they have comesometime restaurants in different things exam some restaurants make you feel elegant and sophisticated some restaurants you know it just want to go in your flip-flops and have a beer some restaurants romantic some restaurants are you know that it's all about the food and some restaurants are only about being seen and absorbing and taking selfies and so is made it right so people usually come to respond to HD comewith each other and uses provide them you from them real estate for them to actually anger with each other so naturally the business wear in and unfortunately because what covid #socialdistancing is the egg is the anathema to restaurants is the exact it is the it is the opposite of restaurants in a sense that Soham that is why we are right now we cannot continue to function as as well as what we intended to bewhen you come up with the restaurant to take on a really large Prime real estate you you know you spend a lot of money and make you look beautiful we spend a lot of money on the audio you spend money on the Dekho you send money on the server is the tables and chairs and what are the superpowers all this kryptonite the restaurant has recently been taken away so it's a bit of a jolt to the system and everybody including me is trying to figure out our relevance in in the lawcoronavirus tried everything with ride home delivery case we tried a Cocktail mixes ever done all that but we set up our infrastructure investments and a superpower and not about that we are set up to entertain people that Ruby Hospital to take care of people when you walk into a resource not just about cooking food in a bag in 72 hours we can do that of course and act as primary 1due to keep in touch to the customers they don't forget it so we do delivery so they can get that it can be as a table in order that primary business is actually posting people inside the restaurant which is what you are taking a big building and then right now we have to understand that we is very tempting 2012 2 strings and want to prepare 10 find find that magic tricks that nobody else was found the factwe are in the business of roasting people in our spaces and was no longer there are you just have to you know by the time wait for a wire take a deep breath a little bit because I want to lead extremely stressful life extremely specialised take the stand down time Hero just recharge it is insta try and reduce stomach pain as much pain as it and which means that got your landlord have a chat with themSindhiya in a bad place how can we work this out can you can you reduce my range can it was the latter can I deserve this out have cash on happening walk away and it to find another day for sure it's not easy is not easy being in the restaurant business right now but you know I mean it is what it is like to just give the listener some contextyour founder of so many famous change the social change in you know like is like in almost every Indian city now do like people from a lot of people don't know that you are behind it I am sure every young Indian has died of been to one of your restaurants to actually could you yourself take us through the whole list super quick just the listeners know everything that you are in charge of I can tell you that we started our journey with the restaurant and Mochahave you serving coffee and dessert and we are famous heroine famously kind of his four Hookah train at that point it and then remove car when we open the salt water grill and became Salt Water Cafe Smoke House Deli which is one of my favourite restaurant flea Bazaar Cafe ishala slink and bardot souffle silver clayPet Cafe rights and social Smoke House Deli has been a personal favourite of my Mummy 4 years now like it's kind of a happy place and the coming back to the conversation while I understand that hard I just want you to separate like the entrepreneur Riaz from yourself and just think of the guide us do when all the started happening back in March when the lockdown han becoming a realityI was really scared because I'm like to have a team of 10 video professionals how the like corporate you know remotely I can't imagine what you went through so what did the man Riaz go through life what were you thinking it was a Nightmare and I kept wanting to make a promise to be honest and its and it's part of it hasn't really stand stillthe first thought was you know what will happen to my business and what happened to my family but you know that quickly made way to what happened why people because it was gonna win over singer on a daily basis you they were going through a lot of pain and insecurity and anxiety and advances for the because I didn't know myself what I could do it was all very well try and figure it out when locked a clock and we thought it to be for yourcan we all come out it seem like a lifetime peoples suppliers it was but to me then realising that it's ok not to have all the answers is OK to you know not know the next possible because you are so used to seeing that I do you know has all the answers and will get everybodybut this time I just had to have no option to adjust Round up on my people in and have a chat with them face to face I will it I will eat a lot of room countries with cord when we shut down we had about 3900 people working for intracellular directly so it was it was really horrible but I just tired to tell people as honesty and clean the as possible that look you now as of nowI can't really do much when things get better I'll take all of you backwards as I can't do much for you guys and I think people appreciate the honesty and it was horrible to be the bearer of such terrible news but I think that the supporting the love I got from my people was really really hard for me give me a lot of strength and also lead me to believe that the business is not about 1% 12 people is about the entire family you make it up so it was it waspencil life changing lesson for me also there to realise that is not about me doing things for the members about their drinking Sumi very intense already and keeping in mind just the scale of which your business is I canimagine what you are going to in terms of lifting the debate on your shoulders so that weight around until my people took it from me and that is can seem like a bird and was also a privilege like what you mean the fact is that you know you are outcan you finish it in a sense that you're riding a tiger so in that sense it feels like a bird in but it is also a privilege to be able to create something to actually I know dream of something and be able to kind of seat materialize in front of your eyes and then to actually have it as it is one of the things that involve a lot of people dream of being entrepreneurs but do they don'tsomething that you want to spend the rest of our lives we never know and those guys would find it don't find themselves not in a position to do what they want to do because there were other responsibilities maybe they enjoy the financial position to do that maybe I don't know how to do it and the third part of this Jigsaw is actually having the talent and the passion for the thing that you think you love doing also think that all these things will come together that that that is a position of this privilegeI hate being the guy who takes this conversation to a negative place again but again this is just to give the view was contact to the restaurant business primarily kind of loses money in rent and in salaries like of the staff so I I know like I'm sure you know your bleeding out in a big way right now because of the circumstances but in terms of business again how are you managing the finances livehow are you pulling in money to kind of makeup for the money that's going out because he was going out and show it in some massive amount whatever laxcrossword what are you doing to like you know injected back into the system right now there is nothing much we can do right now adding some degree of liquidity for the restaurant business right now is either that or raising equity either way both these scenarios are really really difficult I am youras you can do you know catering to some Institutions like doctors need some kind of you know food centre of people in home Quarantine in food Centre people in home delivery to home delivery centres at the base of the speak right that I was doing thisright now I think the only way out really doing it is to tie and raise some degree of equality through the death of the equity Markets and really can serve as much cash we can like to live to fight another day that means taking some really hard decisions you know sometimes you have to have the discipline of the able to walk out of your property because leading money and not knowing you know that you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel that could be even worse so wesome really hard decisions everyday on letting go people that can go out less creative destruction of everything that you built over the last 20 years dismantling everything trying to make sure you will minimise damage be used in query to find jobs for the people who working for me another company is online grocery online grocery companiesdelivery companies doing well so you're trying to take my people and foremost given to the other companies that is all it is it is hard but I think that I will bounce back because it is important to think in in yours now and not in months how long will this pandemic class 10 anybody's guess is as good as mine or we don't know when we will see the peak when we will recoverbut I have to understand this two wheeler and at some point people will want to come back and help you know I was wondering who is the first person ever to have a drink with the first woman to have coffee with who is the who I want to go and meet first and and that sweet anticipation is still there and I think he'll come back and we just have to make sure that we survive till the pointEnglish speaking a Punjabi who enjoys the good life that's exactly what I believe I think this could be a massive bounce back in the hospitality industry lots of people waiting to get out but also again like if I had to just take all experiences from these four months was when you are one big Life lesson just one Life lesson you know you tend to getin your own identity in your own head was Riaz before I became a restaurant and I am actually quite sure into what is in I love being a homebody and reading books and forgotten about that for a lot education Mysore restaurant are you have you have to be gregarious you are to be outgoing your so you know the Wild Wild living that life was reallymore quiet more nice nice to be acquainted with myself again is nice to spend so much quality time is my children and my wife and I will stronger Bond with them slowdown little with and you know it was so stressed out there is a constant state of low-level stress when your restaurant orbit is there always something going wrong or just aboutgold and especially on salaries in weekends is always more stressful really don't have too much down time so I think that one good thing is that University can this kind of moment to pause in reset in recalibrate myself in a personal level have never been happier when on a business level you know things are really reallywhen I was growing up I didn't have that many friends I was painfully shy I was always tell you it's always always you know it is this that was always a socially awkward always uncertain whether in a warm welcome there or not so at my best books I spend a lot of time reading and I think come it took a while for me to you don't think I'd really help me and gave a lot more confidence in myselftrain from being shy as I am I have to now Charlie Puth on this suit wear I am with restaurant is the word you usually associated flamboyance like you know so when you are saying that you are shy I don't I don't completely understand how you broke through that shell so that exactly where I want to begin your story that will talk about how you built out the businessthat first egg shell that you broke which is that Hollywood from being shy to becoming the guy who has talked to people can get shit done how did that happen let you tell yourself something you practice some kind of I don't know personality development technique like what happened with spending time with a lot of books does transform you into a slightly more articulate well read the wrong person so it is that does give your son sense of confidence inand before I want to the restaurant is available through salesman I think Businessman is is really something you know which will give you a lot of insight into people and how do you actually kind of ingratiate yourself with people and how do you get them to trust you in a very small period of time and how can you you know make them feel better about themselves of that while others are selling shoes and thatyoung when I started off as its uses - 14 or 15 and aunty the shoes look so lovely on your so very quicklyI want a fan of friend of mine yesterday and he said something really cool is said that everything in life 10 Renault everything in life is sales whether that is actually selling your product or even marketing yourself like a single guy like myself together party I'm not saying I'm fried potato anyone but you have to get a project yourself in a certain way and even that is its own form of psychology of selling yourself so which brings me back to the books is for quite some books and give youstrength that gave you confidence could you name some of them like some books that had an impact on you when you were younger ok some books importantreally I was really a fan of fan of well written with so you know books like apps unbearable lightness of being the count in age but but what do you gain from fiction is you know it's reallyyou have to understand all of his business books are nothing but one big marketing spillway every give you the truth but when you read fiction I think I'm it gives you a window into another another life another time and other space in a sentence having the ability to Pan of string together towards well use use them well Salman Rushdie that really well and interview with great effect by Naukari again one of my favouriteDubai actually use word as a means of communication and not is communication but also means of of of basically connection is is really really special every discover the joy of reading Again which again you know I mean really something which are not on a screen is is it is great I am enjoying that sojust friends that you never leave you stay on Asia you become the books you read as they say and from what I have gained from this chat with you is that I felt like you learnt I mean it if it sounds bad will you learnt sentence construction and somewhere that translated into sales when you match with your own internal business acumen am I right I am I am I am not a big deal about popularwhen it comes to Mysore red still very shy I don't really kind of I am not very good social media in a very good at putting myself out there in on a day-to-day basis but I am very passionate about the things and build that something I really like to share so for me is is more Amit I get to know you like it when some people out there who built who is specially entrepreneurs who are leading the company like for example Richard Branson is the brand that aloneis the breath when they also want to learners who would not really putting themselves or more about the product in the latter category and other guy who likes to lead that particular life has to be a particular it is not that kaxot actually kind of my private life is very very quiet and and downtime and relaxed when I am entertaining I wanna be the guyso when was speaking about the things you built I want to go back to mauka your first restaurant how do you start from one establishment and then build out so much and also in what you with that because I remember mauka coming up in in in Bombay when I was a teenager select 2005-2006 I'm guessing 2001 ok cool so that's like almost 20 years even doing this what's the story was the what's the what happened99 that got you thinking about to become that guy in 20 years when I started off my career with shoes says when it might be given to amounts to shop in which year did you know I had my shoe shop which I am for 5-6 years and I think that had been dating somebody and I found that in Bombay never really had entertainment tutorial could do muchyou are I know if you want to kind of Commune with your city is going up and down on Marine Drive only sea face I know there was really at that point the time not must do not much to Dubai by means of entertainment method like you know Bombay need to have something which where people can just go and hang out and do so I got into the family entertainment centres which is basically bowling alleys go karting tracks hours helping Consulting in a developerTu to set up those things and they wouldn't notice was people used to come for these activities but no matter what happened why they've been bowling or not with 11 bumping into into the pumping ka or not they would definitely Grab a cup of coffee and a sandwich in take the time to actually hangout with each other and slowly slowly is my so just for a coffee machine in some States have which is there and that was never slowly slowly started enjoying that part of the business a lot more than just the bodyyou know I thought that people just needed a space to hang out with each other and for you know it might appear strange but for 4 people now but if at all you wanted to go to a restaurant at let se 5-8 PM and hang out are you could going when you went to a five-star coffee shop which is open 24 hours or you went into a wood DP restaurant to have Idlirestaurants open only from 12 to 3 and then on 7 to 10 in the evenings and you never really had an old a space to really hang out so that homeo coronavirus came out and been established by popular in the West Africa moderate or we wanted to do something like a coffee shop but we didn't want to do a rip off so we wanted to create our own the space that people and create a atmosphereconversation to be built around a middle east and coffee shop which was the cause of death in Morocco the people used to gather around coffee and a cooker and they know that the inner wear shall be having no way so that was the real disposition and I honestly didn't know anything about restaurant 80 Noida but there's nothing and I just found some really great coffee from all over the world and I stoodDubai Desert from other people and sell it in my restaurant opposite and I was selling coffee was easy to to make and these are so coming from outside so it's just started from that so few and that in one of the things that me and two of my friends get together to do this business and we were kind of money offer to the project in a money furniture so we bought furniture formere ko bhi code and a very famous Legend goes from watchman's tool which is in my office we put it inside the restaurant in this mix match and I think that's what really caught the attention of people always surprised by how well it was doing one thing that to another so we started of a company with the investment of 15 lacs 500000 rupees each me and stare at work my friendsand that there is one thing is led to another and healthier can I take you back to that younger version of Riyaz and if you comfortable like talking about it early on your first two three years what kind of money was ending up in your pocket from just that one restaurant we could really pretty quickly so while we visited the first restaurant at every Dinamani 15 Nazar serialpretty pretty quickly and Mrs you know what this is doing really well we should open up a lot more than the first one in Churchgate to call this property in Bandra again with no money in your pocket C now money is starting to roll we are in a variable 15 lacs for sale you are saving 200000 rupees a month as a lot of moneyCastro coming in we were not really knowing it all UP we were being a view in western so we have a pretty much for over 6 years for recited in the meaning of NCR Lifestyle that that's good advice on a sleeve all entrepreneurs where I feel that like it doesn't start of the raise money for a lot of them kind of ITO a big chunk of money in terms of their own salaries butprofit and loss game is really the it's a very basic lesson but it's something that whole generation doesn't pain of attention to also like I want to ask you again so cool like you did Walker for a while you open the outlets what gave you the fact that got to open silicon new brand what was in your head was it again the whole thing up with it once that replicate the formula was it trying to capture a larger market what was going on in your headfarming V When we start a motor that's all you wanted to me just term When I when I did my first mauka I thought I had rolled in AP that old uncle behind a girl laugh and be that guy and I know emissions of having a change but after I became successful because I will brilliant and ok now we will 500 Motors in the country it never happened that happened with social that happen with social the 1500but we came across this beautiful piece of property on the beach on property and it was available and this is why did you a more Karva there and he said look you can do coffee shop because we need the whole day to run the economy is done work so we actually created a restaurant called salt water grill which was only about that specific risk of salt water because it was owned by the ocean and also the two most basic in regions of cokesalt and water that space for that space and I often that for me a good restaurant is is is always be spoke to get it we will always have changed but you sometime when you come across a really interesting property you want to build a restaurant around the property and not build the property around your restaurant that I think that's a big difference at each piece is uniqueso I think that you cannot have to marry the concept in the space really really nicely as very important I think that's what you guys are strongly followed with the social chain of restaurants ok are not give your perspective of a kid who is gone to social right from college for remember us are Colaba social forces were not mistaken and user rate and had a very Bombay Y + 2 is next to the Gateway of India and they remember going to I think the next one was Bandra Versovaand it felt completely different alright but my real Business learning came when I went to Chandigarh and Delhi and I saw your social there and you had a different menu you had a different like kind of look and feel and I realise that you're trying to mimic what Chandigarh is a trying to mimic what Delhi s i dive the little bit deeper and I found out that you're hired teams from Delhi for the Deli restaurant to understand Delhi really well able to paint the wife of DelhiSahi the restaurant and actually a really strong branding lesson therefore all Businessman is exactly what you said that you know if you start a business out of Bombay is very likely that your customers will come from Bombay summer from Delhi mein not in appeal as much if you grow it out on a national level Indians will have your account will be the Japanese want so where you start your business your target market is always around you is a great branding lesson but againcan you play this and you thought of consciously how did that thing happen social was a kind of community space for that particular community is that it is notbest quotes in the Bible will die in the east coast with in India is is is is very very different we we have so many no one seems like there is a huge South Bombay North Bombay divide you know there is a fall fest Bombay Central Line Bombay divide between the things that I really enjoyed getting to understand each city was slightly different and they know how this people was slightly different and you can you take a fewlessons like that it City being different so for example like Bombay for example Bombay is not in your face you have to kind of Discover Bombay write in a cell that is in Delhi you have Connaught Place you have Vasant Kunj to have cyber hub you have Grand Villa was you have Hauz Khas village level is releasedBombay is more punctuate is most paid out you have to go into the balance to discover Bombay is not is not about the hubs in everything is then considered the Bombay is all about niche dukan Upar Makan where is all about you know your residential Colony no commercial activities allowed to be people in the south of IndiaBombay because of the Gujarati influence may be like a food a little sweet sweet but the Delhi Spice is different from the Bangaloreeach person's Nostalgia as different what what is the is it is actually a great feeling it brings about something in your that you like to connect with so that the the Nostalgia people in Delhi is all about Nirulas for example where they grew up eating the chocolate fudge there is all about the power and the vada pavdifferent in Different cities and you know you have to dig a little deeper and that was the most rewarding part of the business because you get to discover so much to learn so much that expand your Horizons a lot more of the most point is like given for Smoke House Deli write up we love doing that because the walls are illustrated museums of that particular community so smokers Bandra is aboutgo and villages that used to exist in Bandra as a v the 15 villages that used to exist and FIR see your perpendicular all about money and monopoli is really nice looking a little deeper under the skin of way you are as a location and and being respectful of everything due to collect all the data anyway like do you kind of have a dose of something way you write down that ok most spicy food for Delhisweet food for Bombay I just from your instinct I am actually unfortunately I am a horrible document of things it's all here and there as the importance of communicating and writing things down and enough reserving that is is becoming more and more essential I am not one of those you knowDJ super x is no ok so you started with social happened Smoke House Deli happened how do you expand in how do you go from three guys running one restaurant into this big khongjom read like this be kind of Corporate company how do you transform into that I am entered by someone do investors come on board and help you how do you scale up that actually can you stumble your way along your journey you know when you have apsandyou have mistakes and their up you know I have if you can find mentors please don't get mentors who can surround yourself with people who will support and guide you and hand hold it for your journey please do get them friend at the same time I a lot as we will come to me and hand Hashmi should I do this or should I do that and I always tell them that my advice is not my voice because I know it's trueI had this idea for a coffee shop 5 in type of the printing to do would be to go to a lot of people and ask them what they thought and there was any better idea Nahin chalega Tumko Kitna Tumkobol na yaarI try not to work it might rap short without voice in the end they look is it ok to take speakers Innova 2nd 40 mystery certified as people what they wanted their cetfast of horses variable them if you have to go with that their voice inside you that is nagging you all the time doesn't that you sleep in a captures all your weekly moments and youthat by more than even listen to everybody else 100% like always always for your follow your gut but I have liked to burning questions in my head right now the first yeah the first question is why did all expand so much like your expanded like a lot to like I'm sure you look at Bangalore Chandigarh Delhi you could have just stopped at running a really successful chain of restaurants in Bombay to water what the core of you co-founder of Thinking requiredwhat is the angle in O3 reason this was initially it was ego for the need to share the love you wanted to embrace more people and that was to know when you are still more passionate and you say no you don't have a more Canvasyou know you guys need to have a more tennis TV app to find a way to be more tenacity eventually that is it what we realise that if we if we did not grow people would leave us and we do not believe that all so was I going so that we could give people growth if the company stagnant you can't really dividend growth because after some time there is going to be people are going to come to talk anyone get itthis kind of Forward Momentum was prepared first we go then by love when there in the people that the other entrepreneurship like if you really want to hold onto the best talent you have to kind of work even towards their dreams not just those who is beautiful because I think that both your dreams drive both of you fall under both its a synbioticI am group talk about this thing that happens to me some time so I am deeply spiritual deeply God fearing always been that have been brought up and is being kind and Anchor point for me through my career the entrepreneurship journey the many moments where in deep meditation Sindhi prayer at blackout years of entrepreneurship that should I call it where you feel sorry burden of leadership you feel exactly what you said that this pressure of your peopledreams as well kind of Play Store new My Kind of cry out my pressure do you have moment like that not everything you cry a new kind of Let it out some of my white keeps telling me that I am very internal and I don't let out my a bottle Apple of my things but I know that you know sometimes it can give you kit can get very lonely lonely at the top that we can you know I thinkreally enjoyed was my time are serving with the national restaurant Association of India which island for a bit it was really great because you know I could get there so many people who going to the same stuff like me like a best friend School understand what we were going towards another restaurant or because you are the conditions are so horrible the as a terrible you know the police station the criminal the the politicians think you remembercheated on most like one and then you are so hard and height is business and this way a little reward glamour list but honestly would make more money selling ball bearings so it is true but having you know peer group in a sense of a really really have time in my best friends now I am I come to my comp my DJ competition in of people like Priyanka and Rahul Dravid Kabhi these guys are in the ratio of the hourgood friend of mine and they all restaurant chairs in week I find myself in Om even after working out with them for going out to their house when I am in Delhi you are going go to a restaurant that serves in Bangalore and actually discussing your craft you know with another person who understands the nuances of aircraft adding that that it takes to be the loneliness and it makes it a lot more fun so I actually consort a lot with the enemynow there my best friend I think that is the case with youtubers and social media stars as well right before this conversation we were talking about how you are kind of seeing online hate as a subject that comes during covid-19 we kind of said that of a cell by talking to each other words a completely relate this almost rivalry but it also prepares you for word writeit's you so much everyone prove me wrongpositive thinking of how this could be relevant to other people that it cannot win an opening of yourself and living in an aquarium on most most vulnerable side is this it's exactly what you say never articulated it like that but aquarium feeling I was just talking about it to my mum to my friends that you take pieces of your own self your emotions your mind and just placed on the wonderful cutting of chance of your flash and throwing out on the internet so it doesunderbelly all the time this is one thing that border the things that I saw in the in the lockdown period that was a senior what is well with my soul these guys doing no cooking at home and very very good I am I am also earned income so that is just felt like wow this is so hard to do with this window and now and now more than ever really realise that that this is a future night that thedecentralization of media in the democratic nation of media and and you know the settlers in the power and the media is just Boys Town to you as well as a personal connection and a friend of mine Zakir Khan is a top comic in the country today I was having this conversation with him and he told me howset this decade as the age of leaders which is that personal brands individuals who lead media houses even say your normal FMCG brand toothpaste of hair oil will be led by this one do like this one marketing genius and often it will be someone is capable of some form of creation together that writing video creation whatever but this is gonna be the age of leaders will be very kind of individual stick which I think is exactly what youunknowingly done over the last 20 years because when your name as riyaaz amlani is brand is associated with the restaurant people have certain Expectations of that place so I will I thought of that though I know your kind of Loki Gayo introverted but I'm sure you have a moment in your life when you realise it is happening in your life ok that will pressure but are you dealt with it so as a person again how do you go from feeling too much pressure to OK you know whathandle this schizophrenia I thinkTamil to read this constant like duality which again is good typing is it that in every restaurant open very very nervous I can I can really add No wasn't actually walk in a it full I am I am I am so scared that this is the restaurant will be the restaurant will be men during this will be the rest of that is a Riaz of noun is lost the plotit is some degree of confidence and some degree of Paranoia self-doubt never leaves perfectionists I think it's the Curse Of Being a perfectionist where you always kind of have the literal sense of status not perfect enoughHenry Ford II are there like 325 entrepreneurs you can name the other entrepreneurs can pick up from in terms of lessons of all that you really kind of been inspired by you've learnt from my studying them so many is just too many is really hard to understand boy of any one particular order but there is a bit software on that there are worthy of admiration And The pioneering Spirit that they arebrought and HD so things in which which other people didn't see before and I think that we all are kind of Innocence is all about a relay race right you do always passing on the button to somebody has because and somebody as we do in the future will do something will be not something that you are built on that and I think that I think it was who said that we're standing on the shoulders of Giants I can see for the because I am standing on the shoulders of Giantssome tribute to people who come before I decided it is not about being completely original but to actually get through your present you take something a somebody else's built and then you can give your unique lens to it and then it in a summary Act 1 hour and then been something on with their types of errors are you know IP address of a different heaven restaurantheroes in restaurant in India Sanjay Singh chamber for me and able to inspire me to be something because they believe that in the show that works as possible to add to that I think the I think you have to hack your own heroes exactly what you mean you are that person for me and my engineering college when I thought I am going to become a restaurantwhy do you say that again because of this time in you doing something which is really relevant and really important then I am your cooling method and what do you what you think is the future of this industry to rise again I think that's a massive bounce back but your do you think the restaurant industry is changed forever is a Govt food delivery only that what can happen Fortunerthe reason why we have a cerebral cortex is because we are social animals in every state that is that the Genesis of Humanities is need to be social ready to cook take that out of people is this is to be going no it's not that he'll go away but things will definitely changed light already we are you find that millennials are you going to restaurants as painful you know there is energy isorder food at home they don't care about their part of the setting of the economy will prefer to have fewer people in their homes and outgoing so you never know where this is going Blender is hard to say but what event for me when I created more ka it was a coffee shop for the Janak services people were my I was born in 1974 right so up 286 I believe that the direction than theirthe social the coffee shop the millionaires and an already I feel that you know it could be outdated very soon as with any to create something for the jmg is an effect when one thing is to actually constantly be in touch with your audience and know what they want and give it to them in a way that they love it and my last question for you and this is because your kids kind of came into this phone call in the middle again you know that kind ofwhat's the entrepreneur from you as it leaves you being the family man like you can't show them the entrepreneurial side with you can't say about engines entirely with your kids so somewhere there your motivation somewhere there like you know the reason you hassle for growth in your own life and sure that the case the part of you and I'm sure that knowing you knowing the kind of business acumen you have you taken really good care of your own personal finances so oneelaborate on that whole equation about how your kids become your motivation and two can you give some personal finance advisor in terms of AP Industries really you don't take the hit know how do you protect yourself as a man as a how are you protect your family restaurant in I was didn't know anything about restaurant in because you didn't know that it will be done for you dinner set ideachalega ki nahi chalega as you as you grow an experience you you tend to take less receive always maintain that experience is a terrible substitute for use as I think and when you have family you do tend to be more responsible of course we take rest you tend to be Ted 2 error on the side of caution for everything and Universities have what is the familythey also kind of bring the ground you in many ways and they make you realise what is really really important and you have you realise that why families are so important why the responsibility of making sure this look is grow up to be good humans so that you know the kind of stuff you talking about earlier cyber bullying and saying bad things to people that doesn't happen and they cannot feel that they need to make the world a better place income from withinwhich children also it kind of makes you want to be here you know said that example and be a better person yourself that because they are and forgiving in their criticism and what should I doyoung living business advice I am I am a more discovers Businessman now because I have a family but I think it adds some layout you probably it it does it does at some places to eat on a little bit and what aboutthe personal finance side of things like on a personal level how you like protected yourself over the years like in the mid 2009 things are popping for you what you do with your money you have you know when it comes to money it was always all in that it was worth the money we got like that song from day one it was we always put it back into the business and we improve the business having said that in inside was that I mean we were able to build a reallybusiness because we were all in within our plan B failure was not an option for success was the only way to have to like sink or swim and that was it so that one school of thought there be another school of thought Delta you should diversify and you know the covid-19 that we built for the last 20 years this is the way is history all risk of getting this mental in a matter of months soto diversify and you should spend your money but I think you know financial a good player financial planning has never been my strength is not something my wife and I should a fantastic financial planner but I think that you're not just to have a diverse set of asset classes as as you have some money so a Lil bit in real estate a Lil bit in stocks will be Din little Fallsyou know I think you have to remember to enjoy your life so so so so very important thing that I am seeing about the new generation is you know how they not collecting things about collecting experiences and that a so you know how amazing because it was all about your status symbols and now it's more about where you been in what should an outcome news December square is not about the Gucci andanimo Hindi about going to you know unheard of places in doing crazy Adventures so changing you enjoy your life but for all the say you know you in your first three to five yearssuffering right now people were gonna start restaurants and was happening right now if you had to give them one piece of advice about the future of this industry what would it be and say that don't get into the restaurant business because it is glamorous don't like get into the restaurant business because the you can remove me dal very well be prepared that it is it is not a side business is going to take everysounds of a few every inch of you every ounce of you is gold demand is racism is a business where you do it it is a passion

how particular person is in anything that they do because a lot of people think that you know the footwear really doesn't matter as long as you have a good demeanor and good clothes on conserve it in the food was really qualifies as the most admired is a lot a lot and I am footwear free by the sale of used the dream would be for me to open an Indian Steve Madden at some pointso ok my next question do you know you worked in Laga startup environment Yuva Din like this organ and big organisation and C and you will fashion designers work so how much does style matter in professional environments that you will put it really nicely in the book link that he wrote that it is within the first five second the meeting someone that you already judge the person you're just a personby the way the dress because you already before even he was Shadow word you already define the person by how the person looks and people go and I know there are careers that need certain kind of clothing and how do you dress for each of them is really important because perception plays a big role in larger in a lot of people's Minds about how the dayperson talking to you like the speed of the door behind me like the 5 best recipes in India in India lots of the new guys I love I love how Ranveer Singh please with colour fun and sensibility all of that I like I like how safe is always smart in well turned outclothing you know the new jungle people more conversant with fashion you see them really smartly dress but a lot of them need and get help from the stylus when it comes to their own fashion statement 0 more so than focusing on the years but very few really understand there have their own sense of Style you know Priyankainstance has around grid grid cell admin look at the picture also of course she knows what she wants being a model before and coming into this issue has understand I also love Kangana style font style that during the have a sense of individuality and know what they want to wear in spite of the fact that they have stylish to help them they know what they want and also for me these are the 45 people who really but women like some if you look atman I think in contemporary people you know you look at saved but finding it difficult actually I like that I likewhat is not ok is very very very much I think it's also his style is smart in fun and casual leave a lot of jeans and the cancer youthful is what I would say is how youproject in the I really actually enjoyed Ranbir Kapoor sense of Style as well that's another sorry I don't want my Mini Bollywood films all the leaves are really popping up at me Ranbir also used for young sporty at least they're well it was rich boys and lost I lost weight loss of life velvet is elegant in that sportswear space for and Vicky KaushalI don't know how much of it is a stylist Vicky Kaushal also ya he was a lot of close all I think it was wearing a lot of people where do I see I see a lot with style also coming up again new age at leisure youthful a nice affair so what are the three Indian guysStreet shoes white socks with everything I have only meant to play tennis and sports Michael Jackson to is a sloppy fit in oversized clothes bag bag not tailored understanding the kinds of the younger generation I would say is not doing that as muchwhat else dozer probably too since then we were also the colours this the country of colour so you know people waiting for the occasion more appropriate would be nice but you know who am I to save data in night time we have a bright colours at night or think there is some stuff like that is like you know is it is wearing winter wedding is Indoor or outdoor rows in rin themselves but if I were to look at stuff I would I would wear on the side of being more elegant monochromatic play with watercolors and things to talk about suit celebrate to you tell me if you see a guy wearing a smart navy blue suit do you think to yourself this is so can my son so done I think you know that is smart because navy blue suit I would say blazer is probably the most versatile pieceoff clothing for men who have got beyond a certain point what do you mean your first job getting beyond the first moving up in life in is versatile because it travels well it matches mixes with everything really well and when you wear blue blazer is important that you have a good fit God because it's such a versatile piece we can do a lot for you and can do a lot for you with one item of clothingyou can receive your pic and rested on you can do that you can play around with that in so many ways like no other blazer and no other kalakand to know the colour definitely not the colour not even back then that you are not been trying God same I completely agree with that you're not trying other than blue what are the colours you like to come to mens jackets and blazersperson I would do pay colours I would do piece out to bheja wood wood wood I am wrong person I know you areand you thought colour Mysore colour for for men would be obviously grey grey dark grey light green main I apply for steel grey like he works better it has some lightness it has some coloured and put you in this black mole is not as corporate it is not is it can be fun disturb lightly it can be serious rest of the time it works well I'm in the other colour with after blue would benight dress what's your take on leg men's perfumes I think special in India body care is really grooming is really really an important aspect of your life and you don't want to walk into a room talking to someone you know who is completely out of shape and it is especially in India because of the humidity because of the heat is metal or a growing is something that peopledon't pay attention to I think that really is an important very important aspect of one's personality you know as much is very good outfit you need to be well groomed list out like your top three favourite fragrances that you would recommend the everyday Gai everyday I don't know how that worksacross the board is something like Davidoff Cool Water cool water works well nice fragrance good I use different stuff I use something I use is something called short note something booking called call lagerfeld for men like if I prefer muski Boudi Romance will dependyah Masti Gudi I don't know how that signal how that what that cannot Masti Woody is what I like your school also be told I think that I really really like which is really shop in city is called Anokhi number 1 Kasamsmall yellow bottle again and again every day is it is finishedSamsung world that I have for myself a perfume is also like that if it doesn't speak beyond me it needs to be me is only for people were found it and I'll be coming back to my favorites like this thing called you what are no no no are there was a nice one called no ok if you're not tried it that's very nice as I know it's a black bottlesorry I don't think that is broken over ok ok I used to be the that used to be the perfume on it I got it is otherwise called your soul as soon as a time and this one called Brit Rhythm by Burberry red incredible what is the what is it that you like a thick thick yeah very kind of you know it is masculine butter chocolate boy ok so its like men and addressextremely loud so that's where I always thought that was limited to the Arab World Trade I guess in India also the perfumes that is not like the Creed perfume strong perfume that last a lifetime you have you put your bed in advance and you don't have to put anything elsefrom the standard to strong want my perfumeeveryday perfume is a single Davidoff champion yeah it's if they like citrusy to the two versions of the black version the lite version that something else I like it was also in this Body Shop products that are used to mean something is also citrus in is collagen and services which is really really nice that's often do you other than perfumes which is livenewspaper yourself guys are there you have it you can do it look more classy of be more classy most important number one get a sense of humour that is classy and that's what people like number to read for intelligent and number 3 more to do with the body is your posture is really important you know when you stand in it to stand and I would say stand like a manthat's not relevant any more in this world today but stand like you command to find straight like you command that how you command respect by standing for most people standing release lost in your lethargic kind of thing for cell phones of them the people yes that is because your cloud and you will not know most people would end up with this Spondylitis of the neck is your completely bent over most of the timeone should take time to exercise but coming coming down the group inside again like the items are part of men's grooming and what else you notice that encapsulate the growing process the things I didn't think that young people don't take care of the years I have a name for it and they used to be a minister in the olden days calledJivan Ram movies call kanon Bala means someone who has their own years and I think that men really don't take into consideration that this imagine to me I am talking to someone is little hair popping out the knows if you know I don't know what I'm saying I don't even see the person in front of it all the time how do people have hair like that you know how do people not feed in the mirror everyday I just walk around likeit is important and here really it's now it just take care important to be animal in your behaviour but you don't have to look look you don't have to be smart in the best dress clothes and your personality is what will speakhow are you carry yourself is what is speak I want to carry yourself through both how you look Hai you sink and who you are and the things you say exactly who you are you say that comes from like I said reading being aware intelligible and definitely having a sense of humour Nahin to talk to a lot of people write a doctor of women is well I do so what are some major red flags for women in terms of when do they give when when they cannot decidethis is not my cup of tea and organised and updating this is you cannot be many different people at all times you are you are in you know sometimes it sometimes it's miss any ok to be miss you know you know when someone is interested in talking to someone like that you first need to understand the other person gets their interest and build on that interest you want to engage with them you know you cannot becells have to listen and the most important thing is listening people don't listen I just ok you just talked with talk to yourself and then suddenly someone gets up and walks out here you don't take all the next listening is a part of understanding samajh buttons and is opening up samajh mine probing someone's mind and being able to Converse with them because I think that is what remains onewhen people are moving again when people go away not in life is generally leave you and go for the evening do the things that people carry in our grooming conversations that makes I think would really better for me is always been like that it for me my friends and most of wind rhino movie allintelligent people who do great things in life are even if they are housewives or otherwise the smart intelligent people and that makes for great conversation and give me like some Green flags and like some positive that will definitely flown on women and as well I think Again brings back confidence in your self confidencenot arrogance of love you mean love but with a sense of confidence in respect to make yourself small to make someone else will big but understanding the other person requires the same space that you want that is that is really important that you see that in your able to convey that theopen and lot but don't know how to convey this the people here it comes simple basic story is learning to listen I think you learn a lot from it and you are able to do a lot to grow as well through possible words that how you help wanted and understanding of the people is how is about communicating to get relief from that perspective is really important to the otherbecoming more attractive person gear is long term you launch your mistakes you learn to adding layers I think there is a period on life when you go through that and that is ok you outgrow that enough to say that you should be this perfect person for the day you were born is it possible people learn at different stages on different things and going through it is important facing acceptance or rejection is alsoin the way to Narendra Kumar thank you so much Mein thank you love you talking to beautiful

of the coronavirus nothing to do with the precaution is the symptoms the immunity factor of adjustment of the impact that it had on the financial world on the business world and specifically on you the future of your wealth the future of your money the future of your business and trust me the world hasn't seen a situation like this with me today I have a childhood friend of mine just leader your man so Yash has been used business guide to me especially early on sareelearnt a lot from him his family for someone who is kind of work in multiple Industries we go back a long way we want school together even the most knowledgeable people when it comes to economics and business generally all over the world but specifically India ka English conversation Bank dudh coronavirus I want offers highlight the fact that my industry has benefited a lot from it which is the content industry beauty plus at home wall in YouTube watching Netflixthings like that so we add content writers have been told to generate a lot of content but we can't because very soon public transportation in Mumbai is shut down but all the Other industries are taking Alex taking I know you just now was hired for this podcast and you got a call from Saman Idea office saying I got a message that leasing all government offices are going to be short and since my work in was living with some comment apartments near work is top so what can impactit had on the industries others in the content industry for reaching its like your reorganizing the conditions under which this market operate right now suddenly a whole lot more people are going to stay at home and you know the Dynamics of people change their lives at content if they are going to stay at home and be able to form content can be a big thing but stuff like Raval manufacturing reading a lot of nursing travel lines on specific in such a you did you tell me about the banks in USA oa the Federal Reservecontrast ratio usually what that means is bending card interest rates think it's a range of 0 to 0.2 V break that download so what it means when the cut interest rates it's the the cost of borrowing money is going down a lower interest rate it easier for you to pay me less interest so what the Federal Reserve in the US as long as they have reduced the interest so much they want to they won't be able to borrow your new business they want people to spend every corner 0 it's so it's usually the overnight rates of the fat gift to banks and itsmechanism but this is one of the biggest concern that they had in a long time and the US markets like it's the biggest cell of them has since 2008 Monday was the biggest cell of what do you mean by the seller because of people thinking that business is going to take such a great and things in especially certain parts of the world will come to a standstill people want to sell stocks of businesses which they think are going to take it because which is almost every business to be fair so finally Made in India so there is something for the circuit in financestock market if too many people start selling stocks on the price of dropping really fast they hall trading for a bit is called hitting a circuit the want everyone to come down and unit process and take it from there that happened it therefore these things to happen and Markets and also I have been told that this is also the right time to buy certain shares ya like again in the content industry I just had one of my mental factory talking about how you should only invitation OT platforms like Netflix like thishotstar going forward writers what would happen hours people staying at home They brought Discover a lot of stuff on network content was already does one get discovered now deaf people will continue watching it even after the situation like leaves that it is a change in social dynamics usually if I am as a consumer in the economy if I am spending on certain things aadami going on my friends and going to a bar or went to a restaurant it's my spending is not redirected maybe I can spend more baby I'll buy another subscription because a lot of things to donewly is the organisation which means that something will definitely benefit licensing streaming platforms would benefit people were talking about hygiene product people and manufactured all these things are needed now what are the product you think will benefit people documents show fewer talking about leg hand sanitizers that all the shortage of that all everywhere general sanitation products I feel given that one of the precautions to be taken is washing hands and maintaining good ideal The E-Commerce industry is gonna be a lot definitely a stopbijali buying a lot more productive and I didn't go to Physical retail sales purchase giving don't get infected and example of Uber ola we have like you know ride sharing platforms on lockdown on current in the can travel and so the people of the time is always a contract is the work with you and then they are going to have a tough time but I am with their livelihood especially and but government are helping out it's not that the market is being left to their own devices that have been eight packages for Airlines all over the world forhelping I think it is helping and suddenly it's not a normal circumstances it like usually now by heading into spring summer season the world vacations and travels but this time in Airlines and travel bags flight coming in from Europe and the US flight back from the US to operate things like that so there's going to be an impact hopefully you know things with smooth out and start going back to normal soon write specifically about The E-Commerce in theactually have one of our business mentor Mr Manish Chaudhari Kiran skin science it is one of the biggest FMCG brand in India coming brand he did well on Amazon is now likely be the better than the Grand Tour season but because Amazon itself has got a big boost people spending more time on the Internet to write his brother only bigde Soch taken off to another level is doing really well like to know that's that's the effect it had on his business coming back to the content side of things moreweekly gaming dude BSF training Tanmay posted on his Twitter he got something like half a million live USA like one time table 500k kids watching and play video game over so we both watch football right and football more sports if you are a fan of the NBA is the Premier League everything is stopped your being completely stocked players are screaming fortnite I think there's a message Ozil stream on fortnite a couple days ago so its people everyone is something to do with the time rightin the be contracted to face to face or have to give you have some kind of social distancing like things that lets you connect to someone from a distance that in a community form of 121 those things will definitely get a boost write any one else as content creators right now and more Viraj just call me last night ok my manager Hani told me that dude listen the content industries on a big boom you better be creating a lot more content second my team ine today I think there are three or four the only people in the Centre Building including all of us recording herebuilding offices and we can't come tomorrow is public transport is baby shall I cannot create content as much as I want to embed a story content on my phone or you do some Jugaad Alpha go back to basics YouTube live record my YouTube to refer to the I remember the green screen manalarm is but you are so I think we'll also going to be a need to balance everyone safety and schedule versus with actual productivity there are some Industries where I know for example of people working at lekin food delivery app business is going well they are working from home but there are only so many things you can do remotely so all these dynamics are going to change for someone was talking to me about how maybe this will be the reason that you know people start adapting a more work from over a remote working approach in India because it's forcing people toexperiment with this kind of working styles and just thinking out loud you but so again like we did this detail Hindi video on the coronavirus forrester research whole lot and my final like piece of research was supported by Joe Rogan date with record my close to my sword of water beautiful portrait Pakistan big fans of Joe Rogan and D spoke about how as long as your immunity assign your really Healthy lifestyle you pretty much safe from the effects of the virusyou might carry on you might pass it on so still not advisable to go out and risk infection but in saying that I feel like this also might be won the switches health switches for a lot of people you know people might stop start adopting Healthy lifestyle going for which means that the whole Wellness industry also might come after this is a big fundamental shift cause you to think about way you are EP today someone tells you that you know being not having great cardiovascular health or something for examthis is going to leave multiple you want to change that me and its is going to be shipped and it also it becomes the responsibility like we may not be as younger people you know the mortality rate for people obviously an expert on this from what I've read is quite a lot of people under 14 but then again there is a concept of herd immunity we are immune to certain thing because we all take precautions and it doesn't be make it not easy for you to transmit through coming which is what our responsibility would be here always lived like a grandparents are heading towards lift is early sixties so be the responsibility for us to make sure healthy environment and therefore all of them ok but coming back to the whole financial side of things what's the situation in the stock market should you be investing and at what happening this definitely a case to be made for saying that you know you investment market are down Warren Buffett has said that you know you buy low sell high is like the way to do things and they are definitely the stock marketalone but today judging from the way the world is still be acting and still coming to grips with things you can't say for sure that today like I I believe the Sensex made or recovery today for quite awhile then we don't know how Market open tomorrow there are so many factors at play this is not just you and I buying stocks in the market you know there are International investors buy in Indian market there are Mutual Funds buying for people so these big changes we don't know the way the market Gurgaon Bellampalli to stabilize which means to be a good time is itnow you buy a new weight now if someone is looking to invest it should be very long term that you do Sal 3 Sal social live in which industry again the things mentioned you want to buy which is the exchange traded fund OK what is that means that when you Sensex index of all the stocks in the in the BS it represents how the country is ok so what people can do it and it if you buy a softwaregroup of companies in nifty 50 is a group of different Companies listed on and you can buy one stock of sensex open stop what the difference is diversify like today I buy a stock of India by motor company ok and now mobility is going to reduce suppose that for some reason whatever people will usually less than the stock price agoda modified by a sensor PDF for example it's like I'm heading up diversifyingmiddle include a motor company as well as a gaming exactly gaming company might benefit is that exactly that like so the hazard matlab it it counteract what of certain single stop me so so you have to break it down to the river was again in the stock if you are obviously now is a volatile time in the stock market you sure predictable it's not that it will like right now the whole world is sitting and watching but generally speaking buy low sell high is a thing you should wait for that than market value is a great time to buy the Greatlong term you to hold talks only extensively in the streaming industry are doing really well or contact industry are doing really well so you have to diversify your portfolio gifting from different sectors you know that there's a balance that certain time does know something sector will be doing better or worse than the other is inevitable and also just one financial precaution should be taking during a pandemics outbreaklot of money in liquid form like in your bank account with you don't know what will have you don't know how long will open on white win 2-3 days a locked on right now and it still in progress write like for example we don't know whether the planned order getting more serious and Bombay to abhi just about government offices are also be just what about it were waiting on things official communication to which is what we should trust at a time like this is the worst thing that we could do but it always better to be prepared for the worse case scenario it is not have aliquid funds and also suggest something on human level even make great learnings of life in the last you but is that everyone receives money differently what 500 rupees Main To you mean a lot more to your Uber driver or to your Watchmen your something this is that moment in human history why you're kind of let go of selfishness as well and put money out there in Indian society if you feel someone is running short money Goafriends Goyal Saman release money if you're going on cab don't ask for that 10 marks change 20 rupees exactly let people like money spread out it's alive your documents with the right time for us at our responsibility to help the valuable lesson with I don't mean vulnerable just my health perspective I mean for the financial perspective also like you said that money means so much more the people of public transport and all is affected taxi drivers know it matters a lot more to them so in places where used as a business owner I have pending payments to makesmall window and I would pay them because you know who wants to keep anyone hanging at this time where you don't know when is next week is coming when he doesn't know where is next coming from just kind of want to your human side yes it is a time to make some fantastic financial decisions but at the same time please please please be the I know song inclusion would be the for brother in BHU will host its all about community there in the mouthhelp making sure that everyone gets through the insurer safe and sound and his life with little disruption to the life as they can we have to take precautions and be preemptive for that we should do and as I read on Instagram yesterday that the party that we throw after this whole situation is the greatest party of all time hopefully any last notes when assigning of from this podcast am just that it's a revolving situation and we should trust official information coming to ask everyone and we should look out for everyone not panic takes thingsWacom because things are changing for the government every second or government all over the world level II as they are for us so we causes be prepared but no b-1 safe and sound do it sensible so keep track of your money keep track of what happening in the financial markets are also very crucially I know I'm not supposed to talk about precautions when it comes to the virus focus on immunity focus on health lead a Healthy lifestyle right now OBC follow the precautions you guys know all the recordcaution when it comes to the virus focus on community focus on health lead a Healthy lifestyle right now OBC follow the precautions you guys know all the records in the measurement was telling you guys to follow it to the T and yeah just have a good one stay positive in the situation definitely

you why the image that Indians have worked with all that is extremely political extremely right wing vs left wing and other people stay away from it and I'm sure there's a section of Americans were you think the same whether or not It was to political samagra be on it but then this whole entrepreneurial side of it with everyone who is following the people and people like yourself following people like you know like and dislike thousands and thousands of self-help M and Mself accounts not do please does this gold on Twitter and a few people don't utilise it enough so why how how is Twitter and LinkedIn looked at in that worldand and you don't want and be kind of feel that we want to be very deliberate about using the people in the voicesunfortunately you can't you have taken if you're not using for securing terminal building site of human beings like Twitter and YouTube and if you're trying to push100% referencing social dilemma here right like the whole social dilemma conceptincludes information to be used to but you have to put in work if you read it and find people and their relationship to the right so much periods come from free from their breath of the wildI'd like to also mention that is probably a precursor to neuralink in many ways Twitter just your Twitter feed you can you can become the people that you follow and the thing is I really like that you highlighted the fact that you need to be a dynamic use of Return terms of unit actively follow unfollow people and shape of your own mind through the people they following and falling at stake a fantastic inside another place every single social media platformjust generally with social media in India from 2793 speak to people who born in 1997 on 99 and extremely different from what I was when I was that it I speak people born in 2003 and even more different an Indian in some bad ways but mostly good ways that they primarily Hue smaato like the way smarter way more aware of the worldprove that what that means is that content creators who don't reinvent and this weekend to create on Twitter it could be a youtuber Kudi Instagram forever rapidly fade away the game of content is very much like an athlete Kariyo why you know that this could be a shelf life and unless you add a three-point shot unless you learn how the river and unless you are developed like how I keep referencing LeBron James on this podcast Every Your he addsgame even in your 1718 learn something about what he can do to improve our content is very much the same and it's not everyone's cup of tea to keep reinventing often so the world content is pretty brutal but on the flip side effect heading into much smarter world and if you or someone you can keep up with the reinvention process you can become one of those

your pocket to 1999 the prospective 2019 the prospective associate this happened this is what our life is like now so I feel like in the human story especially as we're moving forward is this massive technological advancement through which the human experience suddenly becomes very different than it was even 5-10 years ago and this is probably that next jump where the cause of remote work becoming a possibility because of ourcan't say about code in content of the future as if you are capable of creating code of content you be alright financially going forward these are the new skills required of the world and possibly cryptocurrencies will be the form of payment will be the new gold in many ways to say that probably by 2040 will be living in a very different world where I don't look at you

India is given me to think of you know that Patriotism is a way for government to tell you for sure thing in this way the nature of bad Japanese person or a bad Ethiopia know your a bad Nigeriayour

effect in India celebrities in stand up comic he said that eventually the whole world is going to become days like everything is just one thing that we all just going to become one kind of rays which is by true thatwrongly belief and in many ways is not just a biologically all of a sudden have sex with each other It also exactly what we spoke about that you can work with anyone whether the sitting in Hawaii or PG or wherever they are on the world Russia you your kind of feel of 1S and also I mean I do have a spiritual aspect of my life and even the world of yoga the world of spirituality predicts that for the following two or three centuries that were probably gonna live in a much more unified world its peoplemushroom connected through globalisation Dekho a matter of perspective therefore become much more empathetic and therefore kind of look themselves as one and not Locanto your Pakistani and Indian I'm supposed hate you I hate you locate humans humans is anythingpeople

will be a very interesting and The White Zombie movies in Hindithis information will be here I am thinking this podcast why humanity is f***** going forward but it is my brother share of data with u i don't know whether its human culture on Indian culture but 5 years of contentvision has taught me that if you want to generate Clicks on a particular piece of content if you package it in a negative tone or if you your first bit of the content they most views end up leaving most haunted places in your face 10-20 seconds before stand 20 seconds a negative of extremely thought-provoking which often you know if you if you thought is negative it automatically become thought-provoking so if you have a negative kind ofon the book that people stick around for the entire book so that's just the Curse of content creation not just in India that rule all over the world works even more in India and all other media houses that we have this news channel India TV is equivalent of having Fox news for you guys you know where I usually like it that it's something like that and they primarily grown based on packagingeven neutral or positive content in a negative way so but I think this is more a human thing when Justin Indian think andchembra peak in signalI am playing in the alwaystalk to you but this concept of leverage as well not just the content of career but leverage is something you speak about a lot generally with your brand could you explain the word leverage to someone doesn't understand it lekin by simple words and could you kind of expand on what you've learnt about the concept of leverage over your own careerstaff definition is a force multiplier in the forces you to have your skills with the message of lovelesh cutting tools Viber capital and and product presentationin an attachment or something and you want to get much can you can find ways to every parent and you know if you have a thousand Dollars you are you might earn 10000 hours latest versionnumbers water are come from the exact same initial Darshan the same backwards from from label from your hand if you imagine that anything you doing in your life is done with the help of a nice leverage is your process of sharpening that night to do everything in your lifeMumbai 5 people and a giant machine if you give order trees in the Salman Khan is looking at how can you ms in US all the different types of leverageand now people in the future in a weather tomorrow in briefly any time you want you hear your packaging and using by Madonna on time right now in it is better to be monitored for Auditorium in that I am doing this new technologysmall businesses and services or so much more than any other businesses in the opportunity to be so I am again because someone who studies Nehwal because someone studies happiness and human existence what do you think works as leverage for yourhappiness for me it's my practice of meditation practice of learning through people like yourself my practice of going deeper into the world of spirituality spiritual learning that I should work on a personal level and while I understand the may not be one answer that fits everyone but what do you think is a General way to use leverage to enhance your unhappiness levelsyou can also keep reading also going like real ways you can also choose to work out their thing that you can get people to help me if it's things that you can safely know that you can do without in life is hard to give the habit of UPremembering those addresses in English you know give yourself a space and the appreciation of The Spirit Of enquiry is why you think that the more on happy you are with yourself in the coronavirus also given more productive you be given at the time it is thisneurone happiness and we cannot be happy doing what you're doing a little things that make you happy find ways to make progress and enjoy your time at the same time and take a while to get automation with youyou are enjoying this time into what should you have any other areas of the same time give much more than you were at your end of the war of the internship in college was this internship in young fantastic work culture and all that but I didn't know that office with the intention of leaving at that thing myself koshagar9 hours at least and other home and this is not the career I want for myself and moment I ever came in front of a camera for summary resolve this week naturally to me that you that mythroughout your life your changing as a person even when you are turning 29 even when you are turning 30 but you gotta keep your experimentation on because maybe x** old version of yourself will want different things from the 28 year old version of yourself you just as long as you keep your experimentation alive my hypothesis is that by the time you like 40 may be an engineer your energy slightly lower your heads not working as rapidly you all so much more sorted out from a carrier perspective when you have time for self actualizationhave your systems in place of the use of experimentation and understanding yourself so big at the core of who you areI want to change your 44you have just perfect for you know you want to you want to change so you know someone who has a stable career will learn a lot that I am pretty sure someone is also come most of the time on a very personal level I'd like to ask you do if you even have any void in your life like a very personal levelthe field that anything that incomplete for you after this much of learning in this much analysisdesign for Instagram for minutes and you come outcoronavirusif things in cells that was trying for now I think this is why is mercury is very hard to love yourself and change yourself at the same time you have to changejust waiting for you or enquiry war and that sometimes MBA 4th generation in programs offered to change will also be positive in every day until you see that change in you can have but you are you can love yourself you are am want to change the same time you have to use one Dollar to Poundmy wife and I are the same is that why you study in the world in detail so much to his outside looks like he is achieved that you know is happy with himself and at the same time is comfortably growingbright light he was happy with building is used in his wife and India is established in AP and has company in his investment portfolio is turning to the morning funny happiness is likeSeasons tracking family and anything else to study to become white in the rest of the French Revolution and the application was it was and I think if you look if you look at your whole life and hostingtime to reach beyond your that no one can I will go and see the whole host of my favourite is enjoying your gorgeous and I mean I gotta ask you about the career Side Of Loveas well because I also feel that you know the Curse Of Being an entrepreneur working in startup related environments is this problem we just spoke of the way always together and next step without being kind to us as if that Michael Jordan shit you know like to keep keep working at the core of the holding and all the steering and crying on to win the Championship but from a carrier perspective we learnt about leverage like a how can use leverage to and heryour carrier progresswhy is your time spent in a believing that the right it's exactly this and it's not just need recording content and learning through every podcast and you know people who don't know the Grand think that I'm just having a podcast but honestly these are my this is my higher degrees in higher educationDharam doing through people like yourself I take the information I sit with the death of the research I read that relate to my junior team I Business Development team and say that this is this information is what we can create with this information so please don't create sheet and they going created come back to me I will review it and I green light or red light area based on how good are bad it is a then my process has to be focused on being the face of things and learning at the same time for the sake of the teamreview is observed during which you have enough for your help you get into it but my you a substitute for 15 year formation in your taste in relation to you decide what is and what is or are you know your but the thing is that you can do you get people to help you with added a promotion to help you withbest diving and people and easting northing how much so that you can keep doing the same provider you I love you see in your account you have any assistance and have an outcome of doing that are you or your see the day spent the most time on Jobs thathow to hold our production systems in a Teacher's Day free spend money and resources for getting stay for guests in interpretation of seeing a lot of things around them to determine industrial so if youlike I mean I know it very difficult for you because someone who studies a bunch of subjects but if your highlight lessons about the world it could be leverage it to be the future of business could be the future of the world what would you like to share with all the listeners for the sake of the 2020story of reception of AVN Shikshak review and underestimate the foundation of everything that there is something that everybody needs and that's that the time was staying at least I thinktotal

YouTube what will be tackling all these topics to this podcast look forward to it go for it so I ask you mango from being an everyday average sports playing Bombay kid to bring their yes that studies in education was really not my photo I did I didn't do some great when it came to my University really did badly actually caused by copying and I have to say that right now but second I was quite lost for many years until I feelfound my calling when I was xxvi xxvii 2 from 21 to 20 my first job was selling photocopy Z10 5015 baisa from office to office in Nariman Point we live in the xerox exactly that then given to people and then it my parents are bad for me and they said I should get the get me a more respectable job kind of stuff and I got job ceiling glass bottles like milk Bottles And I did thatsix years and then I heard this school NIFT National Institute of Fashion Technology opening up and they look for 1 years they look for either first class in graduation or years experience in the industry I had neither and so I quit my job the day I got to know about it and love to control them is always like clothes you like fashion I did I I mean I did like fashion from the very beginning I remember the first timestandard also install to my clothes my own clothes for the seat and the shape are used to use my mother's hand sewing machine to play around with the shape then fits of clothing but then the notes Curie schools to for boys to learn fashion in only girls schools and was not considered for boys at that time how do you climb of the rank how do you become one of the world's 50 top fashion designers to myself that I think to putsimply is I tell myself I told myself and I finished fashion School that I should be the bad I just kept the Bareilly highest at Fatima Sabha should be the best in the world and nothing less but I also knew that it was it very difficult task for menswear designer for designer India to feature on to the top kind of stuff and what I did is put my head down and work at it every single day of my life every single day my career I looked at creating the best that I couldalways fascinated by something nice that I would do it would be something that would lift me to such great heights entry pass all my depression depression on my depression true that there's a lot of your depression is always been around here but isn't as a social media and the modern day is been highlighted a lot more by is highlighted more and is seen as a disease you know I don't know ifwhen I am not qualified to say it is a disease or not but I looked at both the high and low the depression for being that inspired me that drove me everyday was a teacher teacher actually half of the age of not that I think it's a lesson learnt in life very much early that my parents took me to the lectures by Krishnamurti J Krishnamurti and that's where I got aunderstanding that you know your really not much in control what is going to happen to your life the only thing you can do is leave it enough of corsican planet but your plans my not go the way you want to ensure it allowed me to deal with the highs and lows in the same manner and therefore both the high and low inspiring and I create a great shows ideas from being depressed and also from being like could you given examsomething you bought from J Krishnamurti that stayed with you I mean I think that that there is no greater 30 in life god and of spread it is about how you deal with everyday life when how you look at life everyday and how you deal with your next person the person you meet and really that is where apparently the godliness comes in is how you deal with the next person you beatthe people you see and that to me has really been a driving Idea through my career and through my life here also with successful people especially people like you who done different things and Windsor castle in different things and so you are like the score formula that you follow you know like ok work hard to keep learning about this industry absolute and maybe that X Factor The extract was just you know if I want to describe my life I mean that I X Factor would be no reviewI always wanted to expand on every aspect of what I do and when I did fashion I also taught in fashion school I was also a fashion journalist I've done photography I told myself that I should be trained in every aspect of that function or that create a most people just become designers and this remainder 9 hours of 30 40 years in the life I could do that I wanted to know every aspect of design from styling ideawe style India's most seminal filmon fashion cooperation with Priyanka and Kangana and Mukta and people and I had this need to know every aspect of the work that I was doing so in never what it did was to get an independent at least stop you may be I didn't do everything at the same time but at least I knew what I wantedthat's what really help me bring the singer and I use all friend and everything and I tell myself that everything that I have learnt through my life has always been helpful because somewhere on the other it has come it has been of help with that is my personal life or how I see it or how execute my ideas that this knowledge is never wasted it is absolutely agree and all knowledge is great knowledge you also read the LordI do I know you as a person you can read again and add layers to the mind absolutely had been I think there are reading is a way of understanding how other people think any not to grow yourself you relate to other people and therefore without understanding them it becomes difficult to relate to people on this your life you know with my generation a lot of people don't read what are hungry for knowledge to think like this podcast of Detroit Avethe books Rai so adding the difference between books and power glasses that books you go and you scan the subconscious mind in the conscious mind of the writer the author right but with podcast for getting a larger quantity of information that sparrow did not win as deep learning a lot so I read multiple books at the same time I read 56 different books on different subjects and I recently saw in apparently documentary film onyou expand your brain how your neurones fire when you doing multiple things as a person doing the single thing has happened all along and this was a confirmation but it's not like I would read a book from page 12 page to the last page admin I go back to books in different stages and the most important thing is picking out the essence of the book because you know the author has spent a lot of time qualifying that thought there is a Singhif you think its a book into five lines where is really the essence of the book and to be always more important than what someone has done in their lives like it is for instance it is always important to me to understand how the grower what their influences were and how did they think because for me it gives me a way to adapt that thought process into my own world instead of just repeating what they have donephysically and converted into my world so it gives me a deeper method of thing and I was always interested by the measure of the thought rather than one file itself wow beautiful so straight off the top of your hand and three books a life-changing few different books bilkul SBI in different in different I think number one was Krishnamurti is book The awakening of Intelligence jacketFacebook Apne king of Intelligence and the other book was the eighties guide to Reality living life without illusions by Alex Rosenberg which is absolutely fantastic fantastic view of why we're here as human beings on this earth and what is the purpose that we day and it says there is no real purpose to our lives but since we are here we should make the most of it and I think the third one is called thedude by Oliver burkeman and that talks about for those for people in the balances for people who hate Positive Thinking Positive Thinking was created in the six in the fifties and sixties in America for people to get over the wall in depression and live in the future in Escape what they were living rain today if you look at the millennials ineverybody wants in the moment this positive thinking of likho I want to leave I am going to live 20 years from now live and believe that I am going to work towards that I don't know how relevant it is today in today's world is coming back at making a comeback show that you know contrary I feel that in a positive thinking is in today's world people want to live today more than today new look at that the reason why15 different things they do don't lost in a job for six months or eight months or so people are finding searching for what makes them happy and sometimes more things don't make them happy and positive thinking is just live like your happy today and you might not be there but this liveaboard think about it today you living in the future and you really do want to do that and foremost young people I know they want to do things now because Is Lost bookI did not get married Jewellers marriage is a paper is never a important issue for me it was commitment and commitment is what is really important commitment to work commitment to your partner commitment all that do the important things in a and a in a paper does not qualify that I have been through a lot in my lifeI've been through I have been with partners naturally long I have a partner for many years now all of the self and business partner partner all of that kind of thing that it is commitment that is really the most important thing you know you could find that paper not be committed to so I never looked at it as an important aspect like a but did you see marriages fail around your like you friendbut I would still not use that the qualification as to why I never got married provide effective an observer why I think the pressure is a lot of Expectations a lot that you are so many influences that was never there before that you won't let you want to dofind people with both the same level of Expectations and somebody who probably encourage you in your own journey and a lot of people look within themselves rather than look to others to help others and put people out and I think that the pressure is lot more than a lot more things to do lot more things to achieve and unless you have this commitment of taking Each Other along or multiple people along finedifficult to get through a long relationship and have you seen any successful long relationship my parents had for the longest time to write that they committed and respected Each Other they knew that each one qualified their life they were friends first before they got bad more than anything else I mean is not to say that you have not to be friends do you can be strangers you can get together you can explore and youfind out each other in the journey as you get long and that itself is a great feeling to there are lots of successful people but you also hear a lot of things that go right when it comes to relationships and marriages and I am not judge for this what advice do you have a people in the twenties both in terms of relay in Japan book I think that relationships can nurture you a lot and cando you know so you need to be able to be needed to be mindful of what relationships are and how it is nurturing you I mean nurturing cannot be selfish cannot be just about you is also depends on how you know the other person because that is what is the nourishing relationship where you can nurture each other in the way that you want to do at forest areas of concern you know today has never been a time like thislast 200 years of our Industrial Revolution enough we learnt today appearance learn today from generation to generation the degree of their parents taught them their father taught them to the values and spoke about career as to their children under 150 years ago is Saman schedule beta Tum Dr Ban jao because that is great for you in life you did it because that was the choice to de I thinkimportant thing is how health is improved over life people told you generation is about people told you that you have to do and build your career from the age of se 2122 to 60 and then you are retired and then you have to save for the next part of your life with age in the future is not going to be limited to 60 people are already living the late is another 20 years available 200 and you probably have to work on 280will be in good health in good condition of because all of that is improving Health Care is improving life is improving standards are improving for everybody in the people will live longer and in that situation how do you measure your life do you want to become a CEO by in 15 years of your within 15 years of your career do you want to be an entrepreneur what you want to be because I would you do after that another and not millions and millions of years there are onlyLimited amount of jobs that go with that you know how do you maintain or sustain your interest in one thing for the next 40 50 60 years is it difficult for people that were people need to think I would say that it is a steady climb instead of a vertical client comes to curious I think that as you build your career you got to know today every aspect of your careeryou know I mean you cannot be just a master of one you need to be a master one which is the basis of your career but you need to be a jack of all other stuff because today is the age of the entrepreneur and to be known to be no you need to know something about everything here you are you work out a lot of young people in your Amazon team right I am going to hiring process to hiring people with that little can mentality of you lookthings right but you look for that hot prospect that you know looking for people in is you're looking at a place where you think about the new work culture you think about millennials and how they work how you're going to Foster how you go to help them are you go to nurture them into their careers and kind of background they come with in a are you a free think they are you independent do you follow processes how do you structurewhat process and how widely used think that is the most important thing in the questions are asked people at interviews is what's the top of their playlist music please currently you know and what are the three top books for reading currently can disappear when not related anything to do with the actual job the director of the mine mine mine out to me that isthe essence of the person because I know if you have your favourite music who's your favourite musician or maybe a band Pearl Jam and what is important is what you know about them how do you follow what you love and to me that gives me a perspective how the person thinks about what the two because if you are really care about what you love you know it could be anything to be music it to be wind it would be equallywilling to because it to be single kind how to get into it allows me to give a personal allows me the perspective the person as being someone who is in what they love and so definitely distributor in water to and relativelike you got really fast in your career you can we are ahead of a lot of people read I am sure you seen people who don't capitalise on their moment read what are those people done wrong you are not reach weather was supposed to be I think that that's a lesson in life that I have learnt you know I used to also be like this person racing I doing the next thing and the next thing and the next I couldn't stop myself and then I realise that I was creating these ideas of the next thing where everybody else is benefiting from itfitting from the idea and I also to myself I need to do the next thing but I need to be able to make the most of the things that I am talking about develop it further develop a deeper and share it with the new things and that is really important in a simple example would be I do shows and my shows I would have likedideas in one show I realise that other people and building for themselves and I decided there that's when I realised I needed to slow down I needed to be able to put this out in a way that was digestible and I could take ownership of it it is being slightly ungrounded in terms of a bond with a lot of CreativeI also born with a slide lack of stability right I think stability is good because it keeps that each of learning it allows you to bill if you don't have to go the top and I don't believe in this fantasy idea of you know you need to take drugs to be creative and now you don't have to be wallowing in drugs all the time to be create this kind of a person I never felt the need for that my life everescape the hammer on am enough for me is what are the new ideas that are fire in my brain what is the news is the Hunger to learn that really keep firing and and I think that's what are about lemon for creative people also you can be a straight jacket jacket possibly can be terribly terribly creative in what is it and you know lot of research shows that you need to build credit to the life I wouldfeel song in essay you need to be incredibly creative the craziness comes not from your demeanor or your personality the craziness comes reasons comes from your hunger to learn more and sometimes people don't see that what you are someone who's worked in multiple Industries ride what I think relationships and how you deal with no I'm not percent are not familyinterpersonal relationship this really important how you deal with the other person and I think that you know feeling is not a bad thing in life you know as long as you learn from it and not only hear about the success story we don't hear about failure but you know big people have also failed in line me now Steve Jobs was thrown out of the job that completely created it came back to be successful and there are many storiesrich people work done great stuff and looking down on Failure is the is probably not the writing that we're alone now that is not the right thing it is something that is a part of the journey because you don't know the downsides of everything you learn a lot from it so it's important not to to learn from your failing and grew from it also someone who is spoken by Jeff bezos like right at that kind of a leadership position at Amazonwhat I like having him what made him the world's richest person and what is mentality that struggled on all the layers of the Amazon organisation I think I will qualified by a story on my interview interview with many people and Amazon including the global expansion head in people in the US and teams across the US and Europe and finally I was just so you know your famousare you designs Amitabh Bachchan Bollywood Shahrukh everyone you done this fashion film why do you want why would you want to work with timezone I think my answer then really was qualified what you're saying is what that organisation believes in world as a created at the I told him how many people get a chance to change the way up billion people live in is a perspective of your jobthe vision that you have for the role that you are playing in that company always have a large vision vision beyond most people cannot comprehend and that's what really is Amazon Amazon is this single persons vision along working of course along with the whole team of people over many years were having a vision that was 20 years long but working at it everyday withcesses Structure Analysis everything in place in Amazon is a great saying it's always day one every day's day 1 and we still lived a one everyday young and and I think that that is the greatness of the organisation that this is meant I had a vision which started from a book to INR to such a large place today in the world for what what was not because it is selling books basicAmazon big and other books book tried so that and you can see that creativity you can see that energy among the team members everyone in the team is as energize 20 think and talk about stuff like this but on a human level what was in Jeff bezos that took and that was the same thing with the vision of course and the fact that you know there is value for people whosharing and understanding value and building good structure where a sense of value was appreciated by everybody and and the way factory everybody had voice and it would be hard enough of the lowest in the team to the highest in the team this is something in a great word Amazon is Samiti even its lowest level ask your question you are obliged to answer and answer with respect you canJis Se shoe this and this got you need to qualify everything you answer I've learnt a lot I have learnt a lot being their understanding the thought process and the openness then the organisation is different so that was Trickle down from him from whatever you told me about my feeling is that can a guy who takes opinion rupay card be used when is describing the world's richest personwhat's the great attribute to have a person what they like being the same room as I'm Alaikum everything is black and an order like you and me talking understanding probing and getting a better understanding of the places I mean that would make any other person even richer like is that it should I think you should do more admin Richa is what is money at some point you know address after a certain pointI come back to the fact it is hungry to do more which is amazing that crazy girl like you have no competition and you have only your own glass ceiling the break right so how do you keep a motivated at the level to do stuff without any reference for absolutely thank you love youI want to know what I mean like talking to you sometimes gets a little heavy in a very positive way so I always take I would say that come with age and beautiful things and thisbeen there done that and is doing a cylinder is continuously growing even the best aspects of growing up I learn everyday so for me this is learning also any linking nice handles round off to make you check out in

Kuntal is that is the first vegan who scaled Mount Everest twice what just wants crazy and your someone who really promotes the concept of vegetarianism the concept of veganism in this country in fact man afternoon vegetarian after conversation that I had with you have not immediately after you what are the factors are many but talking to you about how much time is affected your body your staminawe got me thinking that may be considering my non-vegetarian habits will get that later but I want to get to the engineering wife first right you are an Engineer just like I am I am an engineer and frankly speaking engineering is what changed my life and it put me that it would be a lot of discipline and river in my life but also I had a lot of fun during those four years of Banking the college and coming always in the black list and not showing up for the practical than always beingexclude for the why was great the four years of life that I had and it's it's also that made me the person who I am today really you know amazing for yours nice Shubhra basically you did you engineering you went to Ms you worked you realise that may be your life can bring you back to India you came back here and when was Mountaineering a part of your plans yaar main ek baat bataunga pahle to ke yucaipa Gujarati I am Kachicommunity se belong karta hun aur total 18000 Bhanushali pure world mein Aaj Tak Ek floor bhi line nahin kiya engineer and software company Mountaineering to Kisi bhi plans mein by chance and this was a trip that my wife and I took to Shimla and allwhat to do when the trip was ke Hamen snow Dekha Tha apni Puri life mein touch nahin kiya tha aur main 20 Sal hua tha usko touch kiya tha nothing and all aroundTumhara taxi driver dekhni hai Suna a driver said let's go to this week call hatu peak we can drive to the top and you see some snow that we drive and water kilometre into the drive there is about one and half feet of Snow World cup ke ghar Jaate Hain Humse Abhi to snow enjoy your time and then I don't know what happens but I tell them that you are enjoying so much I don't go look for otherwe go hiking and about four hours later you are standing on top of hatu peak and if you ask me one incident that changed my entire life change the direction of my life it has to be when I reached the top you know Kabhi Kabhi Aisa Hota Hai Ki life mein Samode jata hai and for me it was like the state of mind I was not existing in the future I was not living in the mistakes of past that present moment came into extreme focuslive it was so happy I felt truly alive and use din main apne aap ko yah bola mountains I just said that I wanted to achieve that state of mind over and over and over again feeling meditative state of the meditative state of mind to Main Ghar Jaunga next din Jab Bhi Main coding karne Jaunga job per mere ko Aisa Hi feel hone wala hai net din jakar main Mera code likha feeling Aaye Nahin Kabhi Bhivoice is happening so months later I signed up for a weekend hai to Himalayas again took a flight to Dehradun a shared kar to the base village and I hiked the moment I reach the top of the Mountain exactly the same State of Mine and I was able to achieve it twice at bus ab yah calling Hamara Jindagi Ka and I have to figure out km calling ko kaise perfume karne walon and that's how the journey started how does someone begin the journey and Mountaineering and what is the26 December ko Shiv take Engineering And Engineering sabse best kya chij karte reverse engineering kar Kuchh Bhi project reverse engineer karne baith Jaenge reverse engineering ke average ko kaise reverse engineer karna hai to build skill and skill build karne ke liye Mujhe course karna padega Jaise engineer banaa Tumne engineering Kiyawhen to Chilli which has the third largest ice cap in the world and that is where I actually did my Mountaineering course and from there on I sort of started getting into two most important things and expedition leader of mine told me Kuntal to climb to the top of the world you need the top of the world mind and top of the world body Tamizha lag gaya tha kya top of the world mind or body donon banana body to ban Jaega To physical fitness ka blueprint haiKahin Kidhar YouTube per padh liya Kisi Se Sikh liya as long as you do physical fitness regimens with discipline and consistency over a period of yours you will achieve it but mind was a completely different ballgame there was frankly speaking no blueprint at all to journey bura laga mine but the whole idea was to build the skill to have the trading to do the hard work to build the experience to build that mindset and finally going my wayso lot of people actually take a Mountaineering which used to do Everest very early on in the Mountaineering journey that I had not very familiar that supposed to be a big mistake because you are supposed to climb a lot of other mountain before you start climbing Mount Everest to to me it's like they are Usain Bolt suddenly pahle din uttejak 800 car race 2 jitni building Hussain Bolt it took 20 yours to build Usain Bolt and so many many small milestones in betweenwaking up from account one day and saying Yahan majak average dene wala hun to yaar Kuchh Mere To Baat pahle Nahin padati Hai to me it was very clear that this was at least three to five your project once I built a solid physical fitness and then the idea was to gain so much experience and experience matlab ekadam varied experience aap Andheri Mein climb kar rahe ho imagine karo kya aap ka ek Hath Tut Jaaye aur ek pair Toot Gaya Hai Ab aap kaise climb Karoge matlab Ek Hath se aapko not Pani Aane chahie Ek Ham se aapko Sab Kuchhgana chahie pura Agar freezing environment kab Kaise kam Karoge multiple kinds of experience mujhe mere body your mind donon per chahie the and once I got that level of experience or thought I had I would be ready to climb Everest it is not just you wake up one day and se chalo beverage Chale Jaate it's a journey aur usmein aap ko Kafi sari chij karni ho gaya also a lot of people die while climbing Mount Everest in this difficult mountains like so what happened how do people actually died after don't ask you308 people have died climbing Everest in the last 75 years but more than that thousands of people have got an injured were they have lost their fingers are there are laws that tours and so many things happen because of what are the Mount Everest 29000 feet per Agar Main aapko abhi Lekar Mount Everest topic Diya you will die within 5 minutes simply there is not enough air pressure consumers will not enough oxygen which means your organs will start shutting down you have a massive Heart Attack you landupdihMount Everest has to be climbed in a very gradual fashion but that said Ek I will tell you one example 2014 may I climb the mountain call manaslu and Roses German mountaineer Jo niche Aate Waqt he got into some trouble the trouble was that he fell into hypothermia and hypoxia which is hypothermia is method Itni body Mein Thandi lag Jaati Hai Kya per ko temperature suddenly dropna shuru ho jata hai and hypoxia is my brain ko oxygen able to up temperature hai40 degree yah Banda bada wala jacket pant ke baitha hai apne kapde Nikal Ke Sab kapde fake Rahe as ABCD wala bich per Uske share Pani usko bola Aisa Mat Kar Tu Mar Jayega meri bhi jindagi khatm ho jayegi Tere Jaise hi Rakhi punching share is completely lasted and the next step of this is death luckily we were able to send an SOS find finally get a share party in place who went and rescued this guy got helicopter at almost 7000 metres Pokemonhe was gone to Kathmandu bus kya 100% marne wala Banda to people simply don't realise ke kya kya hota hai 28000 feet per aapka dimag kaam hi nahin kar rahe will be so that you will not be able to think through straight line is drunkit's not like drink it just that baby drink is wrong with you on a joint or something I don't know what else to describe its like just wearing your boots can become like a half an hour thing over how to see level 15 to 30 seconds Denge 20 25 minute lag rahe hain 20,000 feet per pahnane ke liye brain struggling your body struggling everything every single Kuchh Bhi kar rahe hodiode and tired but you suppose you are talking about what's going on in your head like you're putting on your boots are matlab ab Kaisa hota hai ki Agar Samjho mein ek sentence bol raha hun aur sentence a Tak bhul gayasentence that won't happen if you are on remembering that you are over your shoes you like kya kar raha hun main it that bad and in that state of mind is supposed to climb up will you are suppose to climb up hill n you are supposed to climb over some seriously treacherous train from very very tricky Terrain like what do you mean like for example Jaise Tibet side mein ek area tha Jisko bolata second step 3 floor building Hai per Sara Rock haiaur 90 degree ka Rocker aapke Samne Khada Hai and this comes a 20708 now how are you you look at the rock and you like mein kya kar raha hun Udhar Mein Pagal Ho Gaya the first thing that comes to your mind and then it's like no man this is the biggest dream of my life I've worked so hard for it lets keep going that put one step in front of another will make it to the top so Dhire Dhire Dhire you just of Jagah long you mentally just again and you make it to the topdo you know when I go for this outdoor events 81 for like a group Hai corian track near Bombay also a lot of people who join on the track are nature lovers and nature lovers have like this little different thing about them more relaxed people the Kama Swami sure you know the people climb the mountain with you you are saying something different in their personality something very common in all these crazy people for lack of a better what is that common thing Yaar I think Ipossible as you rightly pointed out that they are all crazy crazy know the better Everest climb karne mein tokri ke hundred percent Hona bahut jaruri hai strong just determined by just want to get to the top and sometimes it can be good because then you know it shows that training and well prepared there but sometimes it can be bad because their 28500 feet that dying but they stillthe chalet Nahin I want to kill it and then it would be like for example Mere Sath Rafiq Rafiq is a policeman from Maharashtra had already attempt at mining Everest twice and field attending my mintwise 83 bar Aaya Tha Ab Ande ka pair Mein already frostbite Aana shuru ho gaya net super cold and lack of oxygen your extremities of body don't receive that oxygen because your brain is very smart it knows Agar extremities Chali Gai To Hamen koi problem Nahin honethe fingertips and would be fine stop the oxygen to the extremities Bande ke oxygen Aana Band Ho Gaya Hai frostbite setting is truly because of the cold I am assuming you already know that this is happening but the goal is so over powering the Summit is so overpowering that he makes a call that 1 movie Chala Gaya nata koi problem Nahin Hai Mera Saman ho jaega Jo log Mere per Tu to kar rahe itna time se jo log Mujhe bol rahe hain kya he is not ableI'm he cannot climb it is impossible for him to climb racing ipcai you know silence those people he makes it to the top but unfortunately loses for fingers so it's tricky you know either it's a thin line between insanity obsession and then also your life on the line to how do you deal with that is super important bro so this whole training thing for climbing Everest and all physical and mental could you take us through the training a dream I was supposed to do in terms of the physical fitnesssing for me it was divided into two portions Mehndi one was building superior cardiovascular endurance and second was building enough strength in my body to complement the cardiovascular endurance was building and cardiovascular endurance is anything and activity like running order to be slightly to be stair climbing it could be hiking whatever you decide to be available karna stamina build endurance build muscle should be able to last long termChhota Bheem Anand show and tell people that in do something that is sustainable for you were a long period of time to work on a weekday and one Hai Kaun weekend the weekday Heights are done at a very high heart rate the weekend hikes are done which are longer but at a very low heart rateis just to work different things and get different level of endurance so I can you change the exercise plan to change your heart rate and then sustain that God and FIR strength training for regular I just do bodyweight strength training which is very simple exercises like push or pull ups planks lunch is very fundamental exercises and very simple exercises and then variations in them that what gives me my strength and then as I was reverse-engineering Everest I saw a patternamong the most successful climb on Everest and that patina most is that every good solid climber had a resting heart rate of less than 40 ok Nau I looked at my resting heart rate in 2012 it was about 6828 beats niche jana hai and its use among the stars that quickly realised that if I do hit training which is high intensity interval training then I will be able to lower my resting heart rate over a period of 2 years I did alot of hate472 Everest in 2014 for my first attempt at my resting heart rate of about 44 so that was again very disciplined and very consistent training for a period of yours suddenly Ek Din Subah Utha Mein resting heart rate kam ho gayabeef it is always great in the mountains but even when I am at home being fit the great thing is that you don't feel lethargic during the day you always high energy and you are able to deal with stress better whenever you work out dopamine get generated and that helps you deal with stress a lot better thing is duper duper man I don't know what it is which were in that either Oxytocin serotonin dopaminebeing like walking out and staying healthy is super important to the iska aur ek Cheez Hai like I want to really need a good healthy life into my old age also had Mein Mere family main dekhta hun Mere community main dekhta hun Gujarati is main dekhta hun diabetes hypertension people dying of heart attacks at 30 people dying of heart attack set 42 yaar I don't want to fall into that I want to lead a good healthy life and enjoy my life so gaya want of water dietMan fly how are you backing up are you backing UP Police physical training so I am vegan as you mentioned the beginning and have been a Vegan for last 17 years and for the first initial 7-8 years of my life was a very junk food vegan Pizza Mil Gaya burger Mil Gaya Jo Mila pani puri Sab Bhelpuri charts are beginning to get the end of the day we are just making sure that the right ingredients are there and then I started training for Everest and the first thing I realised is that I was not Rekhaat all for my training kabhi kabhi Ek difficult workout ki aur agale char din tak I am just thought I'd have a problem in my form so quickly changed my form and made the form correct and I saw that it same thing is happening I change my hydration strategy at change my sleep I manage my stress levels of poochh liya recovery abhi bhi nahin ho raha hai to then I reached out to this nutrition is friend in the US and said you know can you help me out with diet she looked at my diet and she's at my God I no wonder you are not recoveringusne mujhe bola switch to a cleaner healthier diet so focus on eating more vegetables focus on eating more fruit more legumes matlab Dal aur yah sab khana shuru karo fruit khana Shuru kar do din bhar Mein vegetable khana less oil less sugar vs white sugar to be clear to your audience to start eating healthy diet and possible and make sure that you are hitting your protein goals for the day protein to get in the idea was that as an endurance athlete you at least need one gram offor your body weight my body weight at that time was approximately after working out for 34 years about 85 or something I thought I'd have to atleast hit 75 grams of protein a day what ever had the such a good amount of protein man for any human smartly Aaunga to use use per use din tak main pahunch Jaunga to then I started following the diet and in about three or four weeks I started realising that now I am recovering better that I was able to recover faster I was able to go the next day workout harder and the recoveryimproved as a time went by better energy levels better energy levels and I like so ke Utha Do Aisa ne ek yaar Mar Gaya Hun Yaar Wapas so jao Aisa Nahin ho raha tha nutrition piece help I'm pretty sure changing the form the stress level the hydration everything was altogether surprising good solid nutrition is very very important very thoughtful smart nutrition is very important so you also consume any luck plant based Protein Shakes or anything like that not likeconsumer typical protein shake but there is a company that makes new checks if the Bangalore based company and show me check eyesight like a complete meal should have a nice carbs fats and proteins and it has like 25 grams of protein in a shake nice to sometimes I will have that sometimes I'm guessing it's like derived from brown rice and peas protein protein the derived from wheat millets and oats and their seeds inside them very very wide profile of proteinit is most similar to like a profile of egg or even meet come back to Mountaineering bro spoke about the physical aspect of it vegetarianism show your veganism actually helps you when you are climbing Bakrid stamina levels and all that but let's talk about having more general the mental aspect of this whole game like you said that you the Mentally train yourself in order to climb walls are about right so as a set that one aspect is to building a top of the world mind as wellwhen I started out in the journey one of the first big hurdle I had was when I was in 8th standard I was at this kids Camp Rock climbing and I had a major fall in that climbing and I almost nearly died in that climbing accident so where was this this wasn't Panvel and there was this thing called biscuits camp in your young and people used to go to the scams and like one of the instructors like just save me is that before I was hitting the ground you know Bollywood movieheroine ke bacha leta hai to vaise hi matlab se mujhe bacha liya and thankfully I only got hurt on my back and nothing really more happened but those really it stayed in my subconscious that near death experience and as soon as I decided that I wanted to climb Everest and I signed up for this Mountaineering course I am like shut how to do this now have this fear of heights I have to see of hanging on a wall have fear of seeing down have all these years have a good time this mountain so that was like the phoneHotel the first mental hotel I had to sort of overcome and I remember I was climbing this wall servant of find it was a 200 feet Rock wall and then as soon as I have to go down I saw decided panicking because of those of visions coming back to me I ask my Inspector can I go down some other way he's like not a chance you have to go down here and you have to go down with technique to then I start going down and I just was making mistake after mistake and that guysfrom the top of your not going to focus your f****** die and distorted and effects of it hit me that one moment I just come down and things is between crystal clear in that moment and then I was able to hear him he said just put the Fort 90 degrees on the wall and walk as if you would walk normally and I did that and I decided the 200 feet wall and I was down and that's the first time I realisedam I going to overcome my fear of heights of overcoming fear of going down or up is that I know that many situations will happen I have to let it pass I have to focus I have a calm mind and then just follow the technique and that do this over and over and over again so many times that is someone wake me up from the sleep I should still be able to do that without now it should become second nature to me is what I'm trying to say and that's what I did for the neckuse this is of course one second was I quickly realised that pushing myself physically was giving me a mental age test for example let's say typical workout for me some time should be that out 2 full hundred rupees and these hundred rupees had to be done live within 13 or 14 minutes so I would do the hundred rupees and you must have done burpees humic acid on these things after doing hundred burpees it just felt as if I was no pass out and in that state out sit down and10 more let push and then you do that and more and show us your body does not have mental you are able to push through and through this I was able to build short of a mental age I would do this in every workout agar mein 300 floors up and down time kar raha hun to 300 close up and down time karne ke bad Lunga bhi 50 floor plan karna Kuchh Bhi Ho Jaaye kahan se bhi nikaalo energy doing this concentration of game Your mental age and third in the last thing was a realquickly while on the mountain expedition is that I quickly got home sick and very attached to my family especially my father mother and even my wife to Kabhi vahan Gaya 2 October 2013 ki baten expedition Megha first mountain Summit Ho Gaya and I was like in super shape I was a little is running to the top coming back down and then home homesickness truck me I went to the expedition leader and said you the other mountain you are trying the snow slope looks awayand it looks very unsafe Diwali is coming I want to go home abandon the expedition this appeal $7,000 abandon the expedition went home the team submitted the mountain next day very safely the snow Avalanche this of course I was making of an excuse when I came home I realised agar aisa hi attitude Raha Tumhen Baras Nahin karne walon so then this sometime in 2013 and decided to click on purpose detach myself from my family from myzandra my extended network as well to make same Ghar Mein rahata Tha Bade practically had no relationship with anyone in my home in my wife and my parents understood because they realised it was the biggest dream of my life climbing Everest and my friends I guess I understood the always miss me the I never showed up anywhere I didn't go to any function that didn't go anywhere but from 2013 till 2016 until I made it to the top my life was Everest Everest andbest and focusing to such a level that I could go back go to the top and back down without a scratch on a Sunburn to that's the sort of three aspects that I didn't my mental training is no blueprint everyone will have their own personal Journeys to achieving mental fitness this was my journey someone else may have a completely different journey have you seen people getting affected badly because of a lack of mental fitness while the climbing with time mein kya hota hai big time like ChaloKi Baat Karte 2016 Mein 10 Dentist from UK who makes it to Everest base camp its third attempt at climbing Everest 2010 12 course content cancel Ho Gaya not

kar lena to ghar jakar you not believe on May 15 for the Summit puch he went like thousand feet inside eyes for this is the first hurdle like not even 5% of the climb volume in 2013 as the first step to climbing Mount Everest is going from base camp to camp 1 and it goes through a section called Khumbu icefall which is one of the most readsections 50% of all deaths have happened There She Goes about thousand feet into that section and then just sits at some places and his shops like crazy little share paake Mujhe helicopter idhar Kaise Re chahiye mujhe abhi ke abhi ghar Jane he literally got a helicopter inside the ice fall he abandoned Islam went to Kathmandu directly and he just couldn't line his leg lost my wallet to tisri but it's you have to be mentally superfit likelike superman

time where you almost had taken as a near death experience but I am Everest base camp does a beautiful accident and your 2very crazy so we can just tell us the story of this was in April 2015 and I was on my second attempt to climb Mount Everest and Everest base camp pahunch gaye the 25th April we were all sitting in the dining tent early in the morning and all gathered in the tent and our seats started shaking ab main California Aao To Mujhko Pata Hai Chhota earthquake bhi Kaisa hota hai telling everyone ka is Vipinmind and that are actually two sometimes because you might think that something is happening its actually not happening but then of course the entire 10 started shaking the table started shaking Hume Pata the earthquake so we all run out and you standing on the Glacier imagine you are standing on a gigantic to kilometre long Glacier without 1,200 people on it and that Glacier swaying from one end to another as your standing on a Jhula a 7.9 magnitude earthquake at hit NepalRajesh to hit a century on waghade this earthquake also caused a gigantic Avalanche to happen at the base camp in 75 years snow Avalanche has even come close to the base camp that's how safe the base camp has been a video of this on YouTube right there is a video of this on YouTube but when I was faced by the left of the skies right of the sky the entire sky is filled with this Avalanchethat moment of you lost me kya chal raha hai dimag Mein I tell everyone that I didn't think that I was going to die I was actually 100% certain that I was going to die so and narrowly escaped death that day but jabhi ambulance Mein hit Kiya Uske bad suddenly the entire atmosphere was filled with this Avalanche first I thought your ke Abhi To Ham ambulance in the Doob Ke Mar Jaenge 3 feat snow body ke upar Mar Jaenge uske andar 10 second ke bad Dekhawho is Mohini 2 3 inch body ke upar but then I am trying to breathe like thisTumhen Uske jakar mein ghus Gaya To Kuchh poochh Nahin Aata dimag chal Nahin raha tha when started reading and of course I was able to breathe his jacket had those ambient pockets of air inside themselves able to breathe in those and pockets and for the next two and half minutes as the avalanche past was Mein usmein breeder karada constantly what did the allergy due to the higher or that the base camp Avalanche pass ho raha tha to it's almost as if hum jo Deodorant spray karne KaiseTu Sara error shuru ho gaya tha ab main aapke naak par Dal Diya Tu will you be trying hard and then ise particles are going in your long so you like more panicking because of that luckily for that guys Presence of Mind practicing Jab Bhi Main Pila Bradley Aana is almost felt like a new baby taking his first breath to meet was my rivers thatmoon inside that guys jacket and I'll always be thankful and grateful to him for rest of my life for saving my life to ki Aise circumstances mail admission Khud Ki Jaan bachane wala dekhne wala Ke Mere Baju wale Kabhi Jaan Bachao and had the presence of mind to tell me ke Boss Mere jacket na ke sath slow so crazy it was a script that that day and main bolunga Na Hamare se 50 feet DurMohan Tha Jiske agale side Pak team tha usmein 5 log Mar Gaye Vikas 21 people died at the base camp hundred Japanese couple this message lady ka half to face missing the skin and bones Itni Buri buri Tarah Se Lokmanya injury and Hamen scratch bhigna simply 50 feet ka difference are so just grateful and lucky that I am alive and sure to share my story bro what have you learnt about death through all this like thismotor Concept of death and meri family Ne Itna Sona death ke bare mein on Everest that they simply did not want me to go to climb Everest and so it took a lot of effort to convince them that let me go climb the mountain at the same time now that have seen that up close so many times experiencing myself seeing thepass by seeing other climbers live dead body suicide me one thing I know is that death is a reality and as a reality on the mountain and that I have accepted that fact and Mein Jo Bhi 2014 Mein Nikla Na Ghar Se To Main Meri Man Meri by Deepti ko bola look there is a small chance that I am not come home doesn't mean I have a death wish I am a very strong and a very good climber and a very risk-averse climber but there could be situations on the Mountain that may not be under my controlwhen I met die and I am not afraid of that fact that became effective but only for in the situation where I am that are not under my control doesn't mean ke mein jaake selfie ki song Kahin Bhi Khada like you know I do crazy things have become regulation no that's not who I am so in that sense I have accepted that that that that is a reality and that maybe Mujhe mountain they are Shakti Hai and I always tell my family that please meri body ko Wapas Le can I get Rai Mat Karna becauseI doing what I loved what I am passionate about and Anya no no no dramatic answers just the fact that I've accepted that that its reality of life and your happen when you are walking on the road your in Mumbai it should not sure of that should not stop you from following your dreams are following our passions how we were crazy those passenger trains are we will lead a very privileged life and if you areliving it to the fullest mere hisab se Ham live concert kar rahe To Agar hamare pass opportunity hai to please usko use karo karo log Bina khae Piye Bina Chhath ke Rahte and we should not be creating about legal problems of life is how my thinking life is at the top of Mount Everest what's the top of the Mount Everest first time top 5 aana I have to tell you about 20 minutes that I spent on the topthe best 20 minutes of my entire life Agar Koi Mujhe bole na Ke Mujhe Wapas 8 sal ki javani Lekar Wapas vahan jana padega to mujhe 20 minut Milenge main ready hun karne ke liye isliye main dusri bar Gaya unfortunately dusri bar Mujhe vah experience nahin mila Jo Mujhe Pahli bar mila tha birthday view is brutally unparalleled matlab tum top se Puri Duniya dekh sakte ho aisa feeling Hai video more than that imagine achieving the biggest dream of your life somethingeveryone said was

and my mobile business in China and the power of export and I learnt that if you create value and it is interesting value you don't have to only restrict your country at that is what I apply to games to win and to be honest area did not happen it India never have but the business God born and brought up in India and its flourished Internationalmiss advocate Alok Kejriwal from socks the software this isn't even the standard entrepreneurship based conversations is going to a lot of places including spiritual places thank you for being on the Runway show so I really appreciate itso let's get down and dirty how did the story begins because you are one of the most respected I can also you know I am not an option when you but I feel like you're on the Oz is in the startup space in India only only all guys still stuck around and you are an investor now you are active in the spacerespectable degree technical master of nothing I think to every thing is a very important ever since I was growing up I like times I like I like the elect the science of life child and been born and brought up in a Marwari family business the whole idea was yaar dhandha karothe rich people but nevertheless so I want in my business but having said that something incredible happened to me in my life in 1999 was the internet internet came to India and I just laugh at you found it coconut water incredible story in my first book wear in one of the biggest most expensive machines I have got personally on my guarantee thatmy father broke down and it could start and when I happy looked on the Internet and I found the answer it was a 5 rupee washer that I need to change in the machine and it started out so that the journey became like nothing but a magical right right so investors business International and daily which became the candle centerpiece of voiceReliance in my profession so that I will be why did you delve into the world of giving away know someone who utilizes the power of waves soap uses of the internet coming and you created something that you saw the mobile wave coming into created something that but why specifically gaming and this is like decided way back away before pubg or in a fortnight or anything like thathonest it the one single emotion that I so whenever I saw people playing games and also the Olympics and it was a very funny affinity for me why are so many millions of people watching people running of people complete in without them even then how do we know what is very engaging is a very strong engagement around to baby for the river and the water And the participantwhich people then everything because the whole business is about it but did you learn coding yourself like no usually what happens if people stop themselves from attempting businesses out of the thing ok but I am not be able to do it quite likely because I'm not a computer programI don't a lot and economics 1st year economics 11 there is a very simple principle does a capitalist is one who gets capital people machine and land together and make things happen so I just like what mark Cuban did with his life like he was Nakoda himself but his roommate is a code analysis of business opportunity that soSteve Jobs as an artist at heart and is built for the greatest so yeah I think that's the message se niche put out the for Indian Kids trying to enter the world of entrepreneurship definitely coding is an important modern day skill but it's not the be-all end-all of your life like if you just have a hunch if you want to take a live somewhere it is possible it is possible to get why you wish but I Want You Back To Lifepost college is it true that you had a role to play in creating the whole Indian Idol SMS situation like like the whole Indian Idol voting situation and I kind of know what happened I got the answer from a fellow startup guy but I didn't actually like to hear from you are beautiful after that I was a starcontest was invested by star so then we went to star in top-to-bottom treatment they were already to successful with KBC and there was no scope so when you can't call a people and expect them to wait and wait and never get through it let's do something which is so easy and SMS at that time was the tour was the power that is a currency let's empower our selves SMS and represented his idea that not only will it become more in kgbut I will be money because if people send SMS urine also visit my people in our Sony Star sorry endemol fremantle they will really genuinely interested in the power of the platform and we created at platform with any mobile phone kaun India goodwood for a Sony Indian Idol what is the magic in the end of a at the end of it it became such a money making machine that it was really if the platformbut ok can I take you back to the right after college please like what what was your thinking back when because I mean a lot to try getting into the start of space you probably look at a carrier like yours and se ok that's something like what I want to do so for that 22 year old 23 year old is currently scared of the world could you give some perspective that you hadedited to shocked so the first thing I did it got married and nicethe whole everyone becomes agreement process time I was the doing exactly like a state or family business of transportation and and knitting socks but I did have one inside that I would love to share and hope people listen all along the way from the time you begin to the time you die opportunities give Cup tikki presenting themselves at on your Doli actually really your doorbell and they sayopportunity have this opportunity in nobody gonna do with me if you training yourself to look at these opportunities and many of them will be missed by you but once you get trained to say something changing the year something is going to happen can I be a part of that and that is what I treat myself to do it small Chunnu Munnu businesses while I was doing my socks business and that make me a lot that when you Dikshit happen maybe in a mera number bhi aaega andso that big shift for you was the internet wave of the mobile wave that would you capitalise on exactly but how old how do you know first big business story began that what is really start working for the first business that requiredI was the first guy who got the chance to export socks from India and they never been done before and that became a bit of business that my father in 5 years so I started this contest to win business of mind when I was 26 27 28 was when I launched it arrived by first working hours 29 min and then everything became necessary so that is interesting that process of raising money like for your business when you are coming from bootstrap background where you've doneNational business model and your feedback and the business and personal use and hold up maybe I'll take someone else's money give them some equity lot with free to go down that path against animal Indian mentality and brought up being told plate safe so I am sure you have to do some real rewiring for yourself at that pointthat time is right 98990 was the culture of BC and religion exit anything people were setting the rules for ourselves and simple and easy money is was small and hearing like half a million billion 131 billion dollars that people yesterday I don't think there's so much of a registered but having said that culture shock was no other peoplecomputer office which is the downside trodden and tell you about these Big Five ideas that you never heard of before starting management was a bigger shop there anything else other than money like what's the advantage of having investorsinvestor come and see me and my performancescared to start your height people for us and introduces two everybody in the ecosystem and that is the power of investor you lived in China for a bit you worked in China for but you know add at Amin this might sound a little nice but I feel like what China wasn't sure 2001-2002 India could possibly be that right now you see any parallel life completely in the same the same kind ofhave has and have nots in the difference between the supervision and not so well in all of the rich and also Technology writer was a mobile phone now in India which was the fact even 50 years ago so whats it like working in China because I honestly big with the whole current political scenario Indian Indians generally have a very very nice version of China and the headsI think the biggest Roza I learnt was efficiency people did what it whatever told another the Indian culture Ki Maina Socha ab mujhe laga those words only existrealise what a beautiful Nasheed we have and with all the negative still I will example it so when you want to get Pandya class the government will you want to sell your company of 2 hours ago when you want to assemble is 25 people to for office Party have to ask about Indiabut you know what you said that you know you always turn back to India you think our country is our country what does India have the China doesn't a phenomenal talent of people were very diverse at their skills which is in offers not so you need to India to be really honest and democracy 300 people you can get these then you can fight for right you can I want this was watching over you this nauvin telling you what to doI can't login to Google and check what I want to these are very big Janam show that that level of control and was it called patrolling limits your thought process if you've grown up in a place like that so that I had a lot of my friends say about China in general and yes is an advanced country yesterday opportunity guess this positivity hard work but they all are taught to think in tubes and I know it sounds politically incorrect I'm not saying that a negative way I'm just saying that culturelistening to very come to it in a very comfortable deciding which is great that's what makes our country so great so why did you come back trade upII III IV on the better you still in my hand to mis call karun kya I can't do everything business platform was taking a long time to rectify and as luck in charge would have it in the grace of God and Guru what is the time what we are done so the teams are the operation and they said we need this for ourselves we don't need it for any one else was an offer that was too hard to refuse and otherright arm but I mean in in China did you did you get any entrepreneurial learning that you brought back or was there in a while you are running this business way you think this is working in China maybe I can come into it in India that was born and bred in China we learn the power of mobile engagement in China we built our SMS platform in China and then I came back towhat we bought from China to India 2005 S so I mean and how does it feel being a young entrepreneur in the mid 2012 why you so live and business what you are thought process thennumber that will come in a bank account and that happens the boss you see what happens I like to change blah blah blah that give the day came the bank that amount in the bank the company got sold Walt Disney became the acquired the thing changed my life I realise that sometimes you know some of these goals are very artificial and Shallow but the entrepreneurial heart right doing things in achieving things really keep the foregoing and is greatanother so much what you doing what I started that that that the real journey began but what goals did you then bring to India like what did you turn into your goalsand Jerry which is very My Heart and Soul was still not understood so I can go inside had was people in India were not by count rows and rows in a very expensive machines to play h******* kids to eat that was a great opportunity that was India's internet will come allies we will start giving and I started my games to in business with the internet and the browser as the starting pointbut like I mean did you have any hope that it will grow in India that we want as a building that was kind of a fluke it was a fluteif you create value and it is interesting live you will have to only be restricted to your country at that is what I apply to games to win and to be honest area did not happen but the business god bod and What happens in India and it flourished international one of the learning that had as well talking to people like yourself that I feel IndianI need and young go on just need to look at the world as the market and not just India as well as interior India that is a lot more opportunity there is there was also a lot of opportunities outside soap on the ability of the band to play board games do it that's my thinking I also have to ask you about a lot of personal questions which will get to later in that personal I mean person ever be ourselves as YouTube I need to get my coaching session from AK butyour something even thinking of you can capitalise on the computer waive the internet via the mobile wave why did you capitalise on the social media wave like what did you what did you see the socially aware that stop you from your creating divided you want to start an Indian Facebookfriends and other sites we had a very large side that came out of the US which is the music site and they didn't seem too kind of create the energy that we see today also remember that in our connection and connectivity was very sparse so people want that connected and I was restless I am not been asked to create value by just took many horses in the stable right you catch one is it on and then you start labour pain you right into the sunrisesunset it that but I was able Hunter is currently on hands of you getting into the social media game and you also see potential for growth that even todayPintu social gaming and even before even these guys on Facebook and you know I want to read this thing when the whole pubg Ban was happening that I hope that your kids to play pubg is replaced by old to build the next pubg and I meanI feel that gaming as a business Boyzone alot your creativity and at least of these old interview resulting from 56 years back it was done at the art of living Foundation by you describe how you would create a game about Parking Car Parking Frenzy and that reason number 1 on the Apple stores but that basically that Idea boil down to your creativity it boils down to you think OK Google life problem is relatable it can easily become a game if you had a mathematicalcreating a good game calculate you only expand on but you could actually talked Parking Frenzywell you say wow I did something to it so what about if I did you like a series of parking challenges in a in wireless internet setting in your car in dying because someone is thinking they're sitting in an armchair your playing with this beautiful Steering Wheel and car and it was a great idea what I did not know which can actually fuel the game was the fact that game VK male became a learning tool for a lot of young tween and teen girlsthe US to learn how to park and drive and he said that you know we have always been 30 and tormented by our family and friends about how badly Park per Jo comes a gift that teaches us how to park with Now since you had success as a giving entrepreneur my Outlook on that kind of business is that once you figure out the basic formula of ok this gives our work is a kind of team you need the idea of you should have then things I can I want the easyplease you have some kind of set pattern to walk down on sophos a teenager who is listening to this conversation who wants to get into game design or even the Builder zone gaming company for small and light it is possible but second I'd like to ask you so like what what is the actual process like from the point of you ideating I'm thinking of the first idea to actually seeing it in someone's phone what's the whole process due to higher volume to keep in mind while designing Canadanormal creative person who doesn't know coding and that person design games all of the above and there is a very simple easy and hundred percent sure shot methodology to starting and owning your game company the beginning and the beginning of that is to work in a drink andcity in established Gaming companies learn everything about games the people the graph the technology is better quality got Paye to do it but there is a growing and then branched out into the room stuff so no longer do you need to sit in a cave and Just Wonder That was how will I started giving companies will very happily Ambrish with open arms and inverter for Ro Ke Arju R R management objective and key results that we just Deone of a kind that I am here because I want to start a gaming company and can you help me and I absolutely so that you can listen people have so give something but is there like you think like the next Big Ubisoft of the next day and you think that possibility of it coming out of India during the show that will come to IndiaGlobal Republic of foot fortnite is rare also why bother with what is game can become what you can become from India in writing even if you entertain 1 million people to started an end-to-end 10 is a very large achievement at if I draw the allergies can I become the largest YouTube channel is a country right on the worldthat you love him that you feel like you want to play all your life and play them along with Swami guessing you enter the Giving business because of that we all love for gaming and then you suddenly they had to sell it to Disney with an offer you can refuse 2 feeling and emptiness after you sold it because I cannot ignore keeps acting like an athlete so want to carry on overdue that athleticismdepression like a feeling of depression or depression the good news is that I am this is the most strange story that was shared with you I was handique inhouse handcuffed because they like a locking I signed a non-compete clause to not do Mobile gaming for three years then the Mobile gaming of that era was Nokia phonewhat I do in my life so I sign that in 2004 5 and the day and here we got over your later the iPhone was launched so actually that non-compete Aviary resurrection to start my business all over again on the form factor that rule the world so I think that any on skill will keep servicing over and over again in your upkeep reading value for himself or herself all through his lifetime could you name some like famous mainstream entrepreneurs and their associated skills just to give the audience of respect the most to make my point that always refer to technology look at the tata tata formula is from Sirhind to Steel to TCS toto anything that you care about your insurance hospitals why do they succeed when others don't because they were blueprint they have a formula that it works it a family is like them or businesses like you can Amazon flex lead to the biggest disguised as a bookseller boss and how is powering up the whole world wide web Amazon Web Services in the country so how does itwhat does I think is a very clear format and Pata That Give understood and invite can easily give you success and repeated success success covers of an entire generation and speak your mind and possibly even people younger than myself is that we end up a lot of pressure on ourselves about early success of our success just because of the nature of social media the nature of that social media that was given to us in a hands-on 11old so that is a very different outlook on success I think compared to when you were 26 27 what advice do you have their and also did use of a similar issue like did you feel that your time is running out at 27 28 quite the contrary write as they attend the agent I became successful people is to say I just started working or just started doing something I didn't know if this agent time it will not become a millionairethis is wrong with this conversation reframe this conversation is better offences by so some of the greatest entrepreneurs in the world and it was measured as a great article on that especially in Tekken this is a shock you have come after the age of 50 the lots and lots of Wall Street bankers of flourished after the age of 55 60 George soros looking itWarren Buffett meat is biggest well after he was 17 years old when is we always look at these young.com internet dies in developing the old people which is wrong also I think you burn out very quickly so I feel that getting success at a little later it is a much better lasting out then burning out in never have anything to do in a life of them which is terrible what happens when you getlater it was getting it in your mid twenties and something happened and that is what keeps you going to reach like a much larger outcomesmall thing that excites you can never catch repeated so for you what are your goals now like what is keeping you taking what's the motivation that the greatest report card for an entrepreneur is a public listed company if I can list by company and and face the the in the slaps of the public market every day and it Shine or inorganic Surfers take my complete public which is games2winI want to prove that you know I can gonna like of a part of an unlisted company was just a fun day company and that was keeping me going and there isn't any gaming companies that listed in India yet so I want to be among the first what happens to your life as a businessman 10 listed on the stock market is your your vision or your thinking become water onIndia and very very rarely decade of decay you can't indicate the reality is that you become very acutely aware of the real reason that a business exist which is profitability and return of returns to shareholders in the internet space because a lot of people don't care about and that's fine but I do I see that it'sreally great reminder of what really matters but 8:30 the most important thing I want to prove that in a gaming as a profession a lot of my employees or employees who came in early to find that parents and their Gardens beside what nonsense of future trading company kya kar raha hai Infosys Baja kar aukat rejoined Infosys proof to them that your children can be more successful and more will the joiningcomplete and joints of 15 year olds of a company to the influences of today is gaming not software as a service at home and like if I to ask you three massive Mistakes Of Your Business Kariyo like I'm not talking bout with due regard them or not but just three decisions that won't correct in retrospect what you want to highlight for young businessmanfrom General Electric and I said no to eat in the peak of the.com boom because of something really stupid call valuation never bothered about valuation get the money in build business eventually you it all worked out there is one thing I wanted to be a I want to play a global a business that it I didn't set up a global office to early so you raise a point about aloeverawhy did you get it is social game I didn't get into social KV because it in the effort I should move myself from India to San Francisco that there and done whatever I had to do which I did and the I think the third thing to be really honest is I've been a liberal conservative in my growth style I value profit over growth and value of P and l over balance sheet I don't keep on just taking money just because it's available and I sometimeideology one has to expand your mind and adding the new wealth creation tool is changing habits to locate ola or Uber that changed the way you travel if you get the food delivery at the change the way you eat food I think I ignored that I should have said can I change the way people play game was building a profitable gaming companywow change habits that the big business opportunity you guys who I was listening to this you but you can you can you expect from this is also while it coming from your centre experience you've also learnt this from sampann ok study you seen in Flipkartadditional you not this system is doing the changing the way you shop4shop again the same way and hours ago that was so that it would changing have it be it is very hard to change your habits imagine if you can change the habit of a country in value in well so you've also had like quite a long hours an investor like you in a sentencelove yourself how did that I did it start because you just had the money to spend I can you want to figure out your own pleasure new thought ok this is another adventure all was there some kind of long-term thinking behind why you like in let's let's play this game is one of the numbers just like uscrore Gai I am not 5 Browser 10 crores district in our tone down the investment even more and come back to the album back to work out to people why my respected aur whom I want to support write it was never but if I give 28 that eventually none of my investment really paid out or they haven't faded yetand what I've learnt is that I'm not cut out to be an investor I am proud to be an entrepreneur and cut out to be a mentor to be reversed if a very different enough to the harsh Eppadi cruelly after the demanding that you have the courage to tell people to chat shop and go home and I don't have that heart actually had a very poor but are all investors across the world like thatall truth is that would giving that the course kill some of the most of them to their why why they become investors because they take in one Rupee of $1 in this promise to give their investors $10 to do that yes you will have to be a very world famous BC use Mantra it is to say in about three or four years check out the founder and get a little get a professional so thathan han to get money from the you already know that you take that money so you know playing on found as against each other in a time to put so much pressure on growth and phosphorus is never end if a dirty give all the love so much so muchis not a tall is just that is the quality of money that comes with the different set of demand that everybody so if your mum and are my mum Lisbon is to each other they come with a set of demand and what is the demand love I just want to give you ready for you to take money from investors roam around in circlesventure capital sorry angel investor and you can't group them but we just room if you talk to a room full of people like to invest in startups what are the conversations like and water what is the overall human why blackIndia buys grocery so that the largest and you will not you may or may not have the largest fish in the second outcomes at the whole idea is venture capital exist because it gives traditional investors a big click on the month if I have a very conservative investor how was what is and putting money and one or two percent I want to give 10% to wish you could probably give me another one percent of my money which is 10% try to be the multiexit is a very important factor and that happens when the the conversation the room is if I give you 10 million bucks can you return 110 minibus how will you build your business how long will you flourish so exits are as important in the conversation as entries which is very interesting part of the conversation in organisation report building a business in every way to sell the businessthis conversation happens in parallel to win a starting of this beautiful and for the 2020 is in 2013 what are you like to tell young Indian entrepreneurs what is the keep in mind what industry should the target I think our ability to quote our ability to speak the English language and the ability to address you know I think globalas you know I just need to look at problems that they face try to solve them in a simple way and is defined as a global opportunity just do it Global resources like all target the world as a marketnow you started the brilliant in style and as a problem that exist worldwide these UP exportable Solutions at private 700000 what about interior India like is there a market there for certain kinds of products should young entrepreneurs be targeting the interiors of a country is that foreign country getting richer and therefore your more more juicy for business professionals officiallarge discrepancy of difference between the GDP of a country is layered and energy goma rural and smaller towns affordability begins to diminish very very rapidly there is going to be used demand in these markets forever because everything is gonna be consuming content or good business which services that that wallet power and makes to successful in widejust do it is because demand and not being wife so I will if you if you understand this area 90% of India uses a stature as a shampoo shampoo bottle with used as much as they tell us that there is a positive kind of inclination to use shampoo with a coronavirus Rashi it's all about the business that you want to run in my opinion veryfrugal customers become very hard to service over long periods of time because your cost of creating a business keeps on growing but that share to your revenue keeps remaining flat or maybe we'll be growing and is always a big challenge but I know there are certain businesses which can just fly because the consumption that is so large as giving is one of them so that's that I actually thoughtwhy you say ok market to the rest of the world as well as in the problem is your market there5 crazy and you know if if you had to do it again and if you were born in the year 1995 what would you thought process be right now as a 25 year old what would you be thinking about business and I know that you probably work with a lot of 25 year old at 1500 office today when you look at them and you put yourself in their shoes and ask if I know I probably would be thinking this wayanything like that I think that if I was 25a 25b spoilt for choice in water what to do at probably have three jobs in my pocket anyway so I don't have to worry about sustaining myself for sustaining a Lifestyle it's good question because the world is also gone very far aheadsome of the pillars of an Internet driven industry have gone to Deep in the ground to create yourself I think there are certain opportunities are getting created by the for service providers at that have around you from the 1900 to 1995 there is always an opportunity to do business process it is never about an hour time is always about the entrepreneurial what he or she sees211 always be entrepreneurs no matter what which nearly one piece of advisory gotten a lot of older accomplished on the process that should definitely focus on one single think now I'd like to give you my own case which is that content company is flourishing is doing well that's not sustainable in the long term as a carrier for myself like definitely use and fame you'll get power use will make money off a brand Associationlong time he has to be a product based game so I am forced to play more than one game was no way I can use the power of focus here and when a step into that world of products I am Amin after scanning with 1020 opportunities of boiled myself download to opportunities which will speak about offline like you know there are these two opportunities and then this is the third company that were constantly growing creating more YouTube channels every year and all that and you still agriwellthat advice of a power focus works you ok you tackle That Power focus problem by hiring extremely well and just being the face of things but but give the solution to our focus iskind of in western people write like as I know its products and then completely obsessed by and doing whatever you need to do to make it in your view the best product or service offering in the world and then everything else will come around people money opportunity but I think to begin with you can't write two horses together one with one leg on one another another use for lover in breakableand on what the most common mistake you see like people my age may cause if this is this exactly know it's not that different people give up they want I think the power of the law of the look of instant gratification has become so deeply manifested in the young person's mind sure start a dozen to vala na vala you give up your relationship doesn't do well in two years give up sobusiness mistake 10-20 years to flush and Asia lot of very promising young people just abandon something for something else as a which let you know that a game that like that so sad because they never give justice to that first Idea the first I know your you got a spiritual side as well and spirituality is one of the gifts that it gives us the ability to scan peopleauto better understanding of yourself you become a calmer person you a better understanding of the human mind set in general so when you someone like you who has business experience our spiritual experience calls another human being promising what is that blueprint of the word promising that personI think just working principle that keep on standing out in all the people that I've seen and stand in my life what is at most sincerity in what you do it that really takes out the difference from the milk and the water wins is there are people this remains in see and do I think values and ethics are been the biggest and the best of falling in failing in our country and other countries because I'm always get what all of a suddenI don't know what pressure this ugly face when they already attained too much why do they slip and fall I don't know but I think is no morals and ethics and your compass is in the right direction a lot of pain that sorted out that the people that begin to just shine at you and the third is this what I call relentless kind of energy to incrementally improve can I call it or i rReliance list incremental improvement it's taken from a Japanese Temple Kaizen but you can have expanded more you just have to be obsessed by improving every single minute but even even when you are 45 years old like what you improve in the futurewhen is perfect and it will keep on getting better and better at your craft and life is a dual kind of game that didn't do you feel like when you're young as an entrepreneur Arab Lil bit more brutal to yourself then when you get older and you've achieved some level of success it sounds like an obvious question but I don't know if it's the answers that of this and what not to punish yourself forIndia has the Inside lyrics please do you punish yourself like could you give an example of punishing yourself or something which doesn't really require punishment in people right now when your young and you have people in your business who don't work with you or don't do your work and angry with them and they leave you you feel very bad about our should have been kinda I should have been morethese words what happens if someone leaves me now and older you find out that that's the cycle of the world in a people will come and people will go and if you are good at your business to keep learning for ever feel bad about that if I do definitely want to pick your brains on the whole spiritual side of things but I feel like that for another episodes in this episode is the one simple question what is theof spirituality / God / faith in an entrepreneur Gionee because I know that you are someone I feel like you exude a lot of peace and I know that from your meditation practice the practices of spirituality but just as an entrepreneur what does it give youchangemaker deep insight and inside cannot just come from looking at the world around it comes to intuition from creativity from a power of innovation that you didn't know exist and how you can leave his things with a new school or college attending a Teacher's you this it is the power of silence which gives you this energy and silence comes from being meditatorand observed in the book behind you the cave is probably the signing of note for this episode we should people go by that book is a book of story is not anything else but a bunch of studies that have a very interesting scientific and a model and the learning energy and teaches you that how can it is called an internet entrepreneur spiritual story so basically it's not about someBabar Azam ka rashtra mins talking SanskritI am looking forward to in the sequel episode with record immediately after this with the audience is might have to wait for a couple of days I promise the audience that was going to be even deeper than this one for now thank you look so cement alot thank you for allowing me to pick your brainsthis one for now thank you Alok sir mental lot thank you for allowing me to pick your brains

talk about Steve Jobs in a Steve Jobs autobiography of a yogi in India that became his book giveaway gift giving Away on his funeral the what is the guy was fading Apple company we know today why is it coming to India and Golden Ashram in Nainital and even telling you work together after 16 years I was to be reason so the reason is that in extreme Cityquestions of entrepreneurship startup business building your mind is completely surprised if it is destroyed you don't have any kind of semblance of your dear let se empty think it is always clouded by decision and when you get time to meditate and you are able to de cloud your mind and defogger while the original thoughts that you are supposed to have come through such a simple thingwelcome to a sequel episode with Mr 8k Alok Kejriwal so so this one will be about your life outside of selling start of the talking about spirituality here at the end it the last episode of the very interestnegate I asked you what does spirituality give a businessman that other businesses other Businessman cannot have a new sad inside so I think that's a great place to begin this conversation how did you firstly get into this school of thought and ok there is a parallel journey there is a spiritual journey was not just all about businesswho surround themselves with these interesting people you know they are the spiritual people would keep coming to our house Rahul young boy and out keep making them not really liking them as part of the book initial for the book how I get tested these in a men and women in Robes and different colour costumes but every time I met them these people I would get something that I didn't have myself would have they would be able to say things that I didn't know they would have a magnetismI did not find in my company of friends and family as much as I did tested them I said what is this power that these people have and without Travel On The Spiritual Europe a dream is a bi Narayan and I would feel uplift so it was a pure experiential curiosity that said if people of places can make me feel different and I want to know more about themyah are you use a very interesting word their clients and actually love to hear you expand on that Concept for the listeners interview there are so many people make in my early part of my journey who would because of the De meditations because of the deep Sadhna because of their ability to hear probably just read people I get you said something very very niceyou can either not treat people the more people you meet the more you can understand and I would just get these kind of questions are they would ask me about you know ok how is your company doing enough I will this guide with ajmeru Sare so you know how is the success of ongoing and no clue how he knew what if so what made him understand I was in the socks business now I don't know what happened to youI figured it out but I think that over a period of time I realise that apart from the guys were trying to pull a fast one on me a lot of wise people had this deep into active sense of understanding how life on force and therefore that questions were predicated on baking me question that understand what they were saying vs Big surprised to discover the side of a very early age I wouldprobably I had to I had a very deep spiritual experience I am asking why was so it's a South American ritual where it's like a spiritual ritual where they have a Brew image to consume it and that's like there was no Pandit who put you through the whole ceremony that had randomly like happened me I was on vacation somewhere and it was give me that shifted to a lot of things for me in my head the guy who made me experience that you also inme to meditation at 22 meditation kind of met me at a very interesting point because I was just starting out YouTube and I didn't know what I was doing and I think I got I got divinely lead on To Let The Right path to even today alarm a key decisions come out of light deep meditation or a lot ofso like you know at when you ask you started out all these businesses you sold businesses to Disney your investing in business is your so deeply involved in the world of startups and business where do you find that time to get into spirituality one how do you exercise that muscle 2 and 3 again like the two worlds clash because people often have this Outlook and spirituality that ok means no material benefits but then business meansopposite the last question of the last point for Sakshi Symphony it's not even a clash is a beautiful Symphony of two worlds and from the method as I write in my book that I am spiritualist and capitalist and a very happy one at that time has come to be in a corporate board room as I am in a Himalayan states that the gana expression that either so I am not alone in a great lives of entrepreneurs gold white LS talk about Steve JobsSteve Jobs autobiography of a yogi in India that became his book he gave the way it is unique gift giving Away on his funeral now what is the guy who is feeding Apple company we know today why did coming to India and going to Ashram in Nainital 11 telling you can work together after so many years I was to be reason to the reason is that in extreme situations of entrepreneurship start a businessmind is completely frazzled right is destroyed you don't have any kind of semblance of your legs a n t think it is always clouded by decision and when you get time to meditate and you are able to de cloud your mind and Default divine the original thoughts that you are supposed to have come through such a simple thing it's like a where would you rather bestreet food of traffic and cars would appear that the wind blowing in the trees provide your it and that too many cars on the street that one is the time course is very simple was something we sleep after 6 hours a day so there is a 3 hour 16 17 hours left with no one can work for 17 hours a day boss and meditation and any mindfulness doesn't take over a couple of hours at the max soI mean it's finally be adding the US when water minister and social media than we ever spend on merit its ok its couple was at the most but when did you start military know your deeply involved with the art of living Foundation at the owner of entering Gurudev as well on the same shows and you every time I have a spiritual guest on the show overseasgive me some advice they need exactly at that point in my life for yours always some shift again it not for the general public to understand a lot of these will the moment will hear this sentence is stalking and all that but understand 12 On The Spiritual journey I want to ask you how did you get into the art of living like in the first placeterribly wrong situation out of control in 2000 by first business was good to go bust and is extremely stressed and I had no way to get rid of that stress other than just suffering tried so friend of mine told me that I don't know what I can do for you provided you do this art of living cost because at least it can help you create the stress is not that time pass ego that is my wide will be taken away from this from of not being able to control thingsthe Kriya Island breeding I learn meditation and everything changed for me now I call it not a coincidence but you can call it a coincidence my business not just survive which is going to shut down in 40 50 days but right now I am still Siri interview in a 22 years later talk about the same innoventures I started so did this meditation certainly give me pools of money that came I by no releasing the giver clients or customers it is notwhat you did give me was a deep insight on how I should we look at my mistress explained in one line I was chasing we cease to be a little amount of money to survive and after that it is meditation course and I came back to my office mai ko partner set Alok forget all the ledges go to our customers and get them both of them a television I work for you for the next five years please advance me some money so that itbusiness I did that our customers a was saying I'll you why did you ask before boss what do you want so we survived because of customer love and that inside came because I never thought of it before and how old were you when this happens when you were introduced 27 28 so at 27 28 at least mind I generation is fighting all devices could be alcohol could beit could be accessed meet it could be excesses of junk food and I know you are an art of living teachers well I am pretty sure your Living like a very very clean lifestyle is free of these devices could you highlight the aspect of voices in a spiritual journey and spiritual progress is an interesting story in the book but I'll talk about it so you are right I had the fortune of good fortune of growing up in an IC good Fortuner in a vegetarian family said enough to be atI was drinking once in a while and I was also smoking once in awhile and is a sorry in this book about you know a incident that happened to me in a monastery in Ladakh where I went with the Desire of getting rid of alcohol because it was in gelling well with my lifestyle in meditation and the day I came back to Bombay something happen and the memory of alcohol FB I did not remember that I stoodis incredible now the point you asked is hearing voices are important in our lives because then we know we learn what dependency is if you don't have a while then how do you learn what dependencies are right Life is Beautiful dependency take away you understand the power of willpower you understand the power of how you feel when you don't enjoy the advice or indulge in the voicemeditation and mindfulness are just Tools and techniques that give you a alternative or an alternative despite that doesn't make you create that I want controlled by saying something quite strange so in other two ways for a relationship to break selecting a boy and girl that the boy is the girl the girls relationship is over all the girl is the boyrelationship of white and us we have relationship advice we will never leave the wise because it's very hard but what happens if the white sleeveless relationship is broken so that is what happens when you put a mind to it in your very K10 you pray for miracles and something that this happened to all of us have you experienced miracles in your life many many many many we are all part of thethat they will effect is a very carefully so that look like pure Americans but yeah definitely something that happened at Pondicherry for me I was becoming very I don't drink and I just told my wife and someone else at meeting that for example of such a pakka vegetarian I don't know the taste of prawn use the word prawn and my wife are species is Alok why are you say Grandsomething odd example you know I am proud because it so it so far away from people by their nature can buy charge but it brought right that's how far away and Lo and behold is 40 minutes of that last arrogant statement of wine or sitting in a hotel and I ordered a beautiful tomato Rasam it came with prawns and eat itfrom and give you what you need at that face of your life and your journeyspiritual practices at 34 situations like this site or the other outcome of spiritual practice in general is what you highlighted on the episode clairvoyance could you explain siddhis like to the listener like what are say these I am in your own way and if you had any experience is any stories of people with this if you come across any appsuper powers not Supernatural powers super powers that you get because your mind is a focus your mind is Lease a targeted at a certain kind of a space of a point in your life in my case I have began to notice even today that in a lot of wishes come truemake a wish I'll go to sleep but I feel that by making a vision by committing my heart to eat something happens that leads me to probably enjoying the success of that give that there is a story in this book about how can you know Babaji Babaji is a central part of this book I just your your gnagnon to have is Darshan in an airplane and appetizers and I have any of these are the mind is I wantBabaji and designers timing from Bombay to Delhi and back now is ridiculous but all the industry is called the incident in the plane you will read that baba ji Aisi give me that dress with that person give me Saman Mohit Sharma routing the autobiography of a yogi and actually tried to show it to be without knowing that the gentleman by the way is the managing director of ATKT in India which is a very large a well-known Consulting firms is not some guy thatrandali recorded call featured in the book and he keeps telling me that I have no clue why pickup the book on my iPad and take showing you that picture which you are very very Rose we are in I don't know why did that so that's a miracle that I wish for something in it came through so this thing happened happened so lekin control by saying these things happen to you and to me but we don't pay attention all calledcoincidences I was thinking about the subsidy this happened they are the consequences for sure but how can you make it is repeat themselves by practicing what made them happen in the first place do you think the the process of sacrificing vices both external and internal actually increases incidents like this and increases the amount of spiritual experiences you having no I don't think so I don't thinksuddenly become your crazy and start shedding all these habits I think what these habits do unfortunately is it distract us if you drink alcohol in a different kind of space you can't be mindful you can't be attentive you can't be alert you can't get it right so eventually that simply say if you are if you drink too much any exercise when it's time to exercise hookahnot thinking you're probably land exercising a little bit more which will make you feel it better way to say I don't drink even even even more so if a very Virtuous cycle of experiencing the benefit of something by not doing something else was a saying that staffing is bad nothing is bad and since u been meditating for a while what does meditation feel like in your 40s like what is the piano and give you now in my 20s it makes about comedefinitely guides me the mornings that I have some massive issues of maths of commitment and know how the days go then give me the first message in my head is this is what can happendefinitely not because your mind is less agitated is less photo so that's a great practical example of what can I do by meditation techniques by my like morning all the time so that the that is at your answer meditation at 20 30 40 16-18 it will always be the same it just makes you feel super light and super sex saying that youryou feel like your in a very wakeful sleep so you feel like a relaxed nothing is bothering you your Re conscious of value A but you enjoy that was your friends who don't meditate like how do you see the difference in your mind that versus that are not am not dialogue donon anyone who is 10enthusiasm their ability to do things spontaneously is probably better but eventually right there is always this clock back right you always the body and the mine always then feel tired and I think that is not any one person anyone in the world was not tied on a daily basis because you get fed up what you do so the real difference between the Mediterranean the non meditator is how the tiredness manifest and how are youbeautiful song and if someone has to explore spirituality more what books of podcast Dew Point them towards lc3 chilipi vs facial shopper do not worry about a book examine and at another drink the Wells in the water of many valence so I would say sample the eight or ten publicly known Institutemeditation one or two will resonate with you Deepa try them out a little bit more and then stick to the person or that in an Institution and wide with you and that's the way to find a spiritual path physician or choose something that someone is truly read that I am very books on meditation and mindfulness read a few pick up some if you don't like it just dropped into something else and if you had to end this episode 1 big spiritual learninglife what would it be that big spiritual learning is that there is a sense of happiness and a sense of lets a good feeling or a warm feeling in every situation so in anything you may be going through and the worst of situations are the bad of situations that is a positive to it and nature puts us throughcycles like it puts itself through cycle ride as a sem summer and winter autumn and spring it puts us to the cycles make to make us appreciate the fullness of life should don't feel down or don't feel to up either when things are going bad liya things going up because it's about the state of understanding what going on to you what happened you versus trying to experience it and feeling badKejriwal for two amazing workers had a lot of value out there I am going to link your hand is down below I hope that the listeners go for it is the cave that says new book containing all these will spiritual stories and that's all lessons I really appreciate it will probably have you on the Hindi podcast at some point whenever you are up for it and will continue this Vibe thank you so much so kind of you good luckand we continue this Vibe thank you so much so kind of you good luck

the use of naturally found substances and the benefits for the human mind and body we do not recommend drugs to anyone that is not our intention with creating this particular podcast with just and discuss scientific facts and the time to put knowledge about on the internet so I hope you inextremely intelligent conversation on the rubbish weed I was ka LSD shrooms some of the topic the critical in today's episode but from a very biological perspective because we got one of the world's premier health experts is someone who studied alternative medicine is growing like the scientific aspect on the so-called psychedelicQuadra creational substances looked in your thank you once again and then we should rather than it is good to be back an interesting conversation I want to just begin by telling you how I came across the substances in my life again or not I'm not experimented with them I have experimented with marijuana but I read this book called the teachings of Don 1 by Carlos castaneda Vahi talks about the red Indian culture the Indian culture from AmericaVaidik kind of really value this 9 secret plants which are basically psychedelic plants which also give you are extremely spiritual experiences which kind of change the mental makeup in your head is awesome this transfer paper tape iowaska another one was Datura I don't remember it and that is what we really fascinated I have had an experience with Oscar but we'll get to that later I want a photos get your introduction on this subjecthow did you come across your information about the substances what kind of value can add to an everyday person's life what should people know about what people not know about it right sofas we have to always respect the law and level on every country is different in Assam psychedelics on in a class a psychedelic drugs and B respectively of the mind wrist was basically I was intrigued when I got to know that pharmaceutical companies study dam in research labs the cross Mexico LED starting LSD testingpure resting bringing down brahmins into research labs to find out why did you iowaska ritual what is the chairman of the like you could say the native priest ok is a priest they basically they use the forces of nature to understand religion and he will diseases and all of these things I think everyone has to have an open mind about is now closed mind will be very judgemental right from the start psychedelic drugs drugs mean evidence of that and thenKitna open heart and mind point fingers always remember you know asking for your hands clean it's as simple as that you know so what happens if people turn a drug is a drug Bade ok taking diabetic medications taken a laundry list of medication which are chemical which have side effects and all that stuff Soham I think we'd definitely not your promotion tell people that get in the psychedelic wear your understand so when I got to know the people looking at research on schizophrenia dementia and Alzheimerpsychedelic Sabhi ability to open blocked Sinha mind you are so for example if you go back to the movie Forrest gump and desert 1 scene where does sugar cube of LSD exercise expand your Horizons expand your Horizons so psychedelics are believed to enable someone truly expand their perception towards life they all are perception towards everything is controlled by what we have learnt the company that we do what the media's feeling as and all of thatmedia makes us believe that religion is bad luck I think the best example is religion that religion is not the problem is the people who have a problem not religion religion religion is not know about compassion and forgiveness been good kind of the types of the problem is with the people in the section again so when people do psychedelic set expand their Horizons is not looking at life very very differently because they're wrong with a Kaisi everything is intention some people get into it like the tool is used by Indian priest ordinationNorth India because it's believed to put them into a transmitter tiptrans and in that Marathi Trance they are able to actually meditate and come up with you know whatever it is that they are looking for in a complete set of Trans even back and Israel in Bethlehem in and around religion being a Catholic and stuff like that there was more ok they would ever given as gifts to priests and everything else what is it is basically a plan to gain a psychedelic thing but it is not allowed to carry in theok because it has psychoactive substances that this always existed the people of abuse that people take it and use it is regulation of our patients all over the world cancer patients in countries where does now decriminalize all legalized from my cancer patients taking medical marijuana and all that stuff when you look at the behaviour of the patient is taking and all of a sudden the family search using it for decoration to that way you know all the confusion start coming in recreational drug what is the Restoration of right nowdefinition of conversation for example given directory Asia drug to change that why does using the term recreational makes people believe that if I have this drug I have a great time too many people don't do decoration drugs and a better time than some of those on drugs here we see with playing around with everything around perception was coming on the psychedelics because of its ability to basic we change our mind when I see it in some instances of perception that I grew up in Goa I witnessed a lot of theculture and stuff like that if you ask me today is a use comparison between the people who drink and the people who do drugs and also other of them are good bad and you should do it with really not saying that the people who experiment with LSD and the psychedelic some stuff you know when you talk to them that different people they take life easy they don't take stress you know they go back to their work countries and they worked a comeback enjoy themselves they look after their families and children to think about dimension which is very differentdrinking alcohol they lose their jobs they get in the fight against violence against the wall of these things and stuff like that because a different psychologists psychedelics options working for you and your alcohol which is something totally different substances that that that made legal I think it doesn't make people feel cycle are you makes people more stupidwhy were you do that women will not be able to Think Straight to you be able to take advantage of them ok and its likewise the guys guys a lot of guys is beautiful Harvard study of why clubs and ok ok because number 1 a man can go and have a conversation over the confidence levels are low you are alcohol in your hand and immediately your confidence levels go up ok because of the darkness and because of that glass of alcohol and what is psychedelicsRewari Cena people are free people are open people don't rape and other people don't go and touch and feel of women and men and everyone's own dimension don't mind that this is my observation is my observation is a pleasure to see people behave when you come to work love scene and it's like taken it chaotic and people of fuel on alcohol and behaving in a way that they not observe in security also includes of insecurity alone when you look at itpsychedelics in order to the right time in the sunset level 9 the pit nature and David of full moon day blinded by the notion of the back in all that stuff so you know the research coming out there is so many things even the snake by poison people believe there's a spiritual impact on land like some people can take this the position of the snake and not die because the belief is that the snake poison will not kill them that snakes in snake poison will kill the person who has doubt the same thing with frog the frog and the Amazonpoison which is considered as a psychedelic what is a good things to talk about and I think as the world's 10 research in more and more into this the biggest problem is how can you control it because it can become regulation let you can be misused can be you know used to do bad things and stuff like that so the way I perceive their whole game is a field is three kinds of people the first are the one who was very kind of consumed by society by the media at the sea adventure hearing this conversation the early life and thatreality but I do believe that just open up your mind to what the world is moving towards that will be the second kind of person which is the process curious I would kind of food UN Academy about I want to know more about this is what the world is moving towards ok find this might have Dark Side but it definitely has a lot of bright side as well and it can benefit a lot of mines and the third category is summer is very fascinated by psychedelics and then you might overdo it who might get consumerwas probably do drugs that animals get into black was kind of exactly how you want so I personally really urge everyone listening to this two place themselves just for this conversation in the second category of openness knowledge learning this absorb the whole conversation and write in tension I think the third category we must talk about that because you see I mean of seen people doing psychedelics and alcohol the same time the scientific we don't go together you can be drinkingyou can't gana psychedelic at the same time and you serious people get violent a get a flip out and all that stuff like this if you doing something to it arrived a few and spiritual part 2 the right way to make it into a fat and everyone standing you start something like this year on spiritual path most people find the spiritual parts of the party live and on the past but they find embraced something like se giving back or helping of 90s and early work on that they are far more spiritual than people in churches Templeit is like that to be purchasing this thing about this believe they always say that the plant will find you the most books and it was like this and thatstructure of brain it real lines on neural part of the membrane and our also read that when you do I Oscar you go through a negative phase as well as a part of your trip and also there is not a creation all you need to do when you are at a crossroads in your life if you want answers was assassinated about the substance and bigger and bigger biceps at 2.45 videos did well but still no matter what I do you like it is no YouTube culture back in the country than half of it was a my dad one is it comes to in his 1 lesson theis going to Seychelles for this medical conference but you can just take long Kum vacation and just take a break from your YouTube game School went to Seychelles with no intention and the resort that we were in happened have this one really interesting guy who's talking about economics and sport and you know it all is Deep topics and he casually mentioned the idea of summons read that hold on Shamil are the priests who conduct I was ka ceremony for people like thisSrinivas Kannada Shiva episode find a very intense Experience so he said something about 6 months and I stopped him right now live aid you mean like the iOS and Android WebView for that would then I told him my perception of I was aware you know you have a negative review of a bit scary experience and then it becomes positive don't believe everything you read on the internet is not that and what if I tell you that I was cured my room will you come and do it so first I couldn't believe whatand then I give it some thought and also know that I don't do this because I don't want to get into drugs that was my thinking that it will be broken down from he told me how is like a $50,000 practice in the Amazon has been doing for that long and people do when they are at Crossroads in life by meditated over that begin Meditation by then and my meditation is cleared out my head I was like wait I'm at a crossroads and read this quote about how the plant find you don't find the plant so I was a gift come liveinto my life in this way it might mean something I am young I need answers let me take a plan and I got up in the morning with the intention of doing at playa OK Google what's the worst that can happen inaugural die and he also had mentioned me that I was call never put you through an experience that you can't handle them so that night I didn't I was session at a ceremony with him in his hotel room one of the most life changing experience of my life because I am I came out a different personinto the ceremony asking 1 question which was what was a weapon that I needed for my life in order to just make my career very solid and like in order to take my career for the everything in my life as a career that point so we took the drinks like this very bitter Brew that you require drank it waited for like sev 20 minutes or so and then everything around we started getting like Olivia bleach side getting a bit like Jelly and that realises kicking and I told him that his eyes were closed eyes now close myand if I actually begin to elaborate on my whole I was ka Joni that another conversation but what they basically felt is you know where I am talking to you and your talking me right now I can feel another human your another brother if you with the woman you can feel ok there's a girl you so in a basket this is that you feel or feminine presence and I did feel that I felt like what they call mother I was they who guided me through the trip and it was it was definitely - psychedelic but I feel like she guided me through aentire experience and at the same time I have like a version of God in my head I perceive them as the old man who would it be it does my childhood perception of it and I felt that presents as well and I felt like both the mother and the Father Like guided me through the trip a lot of things I swear I felt like I went back to I could go back to individual memories of my life and by the time I system Evil kids and we will be watching TV and access the files we had agreed with your child grievancesvery very very tired I went back to this list is the head of my parents you know I realise why does being stupid stupid teenager and you come back so it put you through these experiences you go through like this visuals you also able to see yourself you are able to see your mind much more clearly it's like you can you going to trip in your going to a car ride in your own mind and then finally the final kind of most important c***** of the trip for me was that itimagine that the I was kattukoni in between the side of a highway one on one end I could hear something coming from the Horizon so I couldn't see what I could do something very big coming from the Horizon and before I knew it to break Fireball just like to do pass main went to the other Horizon with this use noise of the really taken aback by it so I open my eyes I told my Saman this is a great hold on go back and your troops I close my eyes again and ask me I was can I askthat what what does this mean it said that this can be your career if you learn self belief you like you have no self belief right now life so even if it means faking it xxl belief that but really believe that the party or taking is the correct path which is exactly the question I had in my head at that point which is that am I doing correcting by creating engineering become becoming a physical fitness trainer and doing the YouTube things and now we are one of a 40 peoplethat come out of that one day when I came out the different persons this year that I was ka changes you for life I don't think I'll end up doing it again and I'll tell you why because I feel like the signed by was that it is dmt that the actress of two diameters atom and sodium diesel is and I also believe that DMD can be released through intense meditations and right now The Spiritual time diploma meditation and I feel like I can get my passport every night live through my to a long meditation every right that the very fact is anything that makes you highAnita the preceptor yeah ok so when you smoke marijuana you smoke at what is make you have a close and open receptor never did you can get high salary salaries of making the Hype sector if we have 2 receptor that means we have the ability to create the same chemicals in our mind and deep meditation produces the bliss molecule exact underwear you have to do psychedelics after a while you have to do it some people find it in life are some people use a cyclesetting soon and your other category of people who abuse it just be cool so what would you like have you had and I was done I was wave I think I was young Navy in my 20 setting and I did it again with the right intention I want to understand what's what's guddipa in my life that point the phone I had no idea what I was going to do life is good and had no problems no Nagari none of that stuff I just did it was powerful Amazon adventure kind of thing even when I finished my tripDashama sat with me and you just said you know you're not lived in of life to be like you said the cross at the cross road near life is it is great go ahead you know what a party on fall apart but right intention I learn writing tension from the Chairman and everything we do is with the right intentions no matter what we will make mistakes everyone out you will make mistakes ok be my Grave mistake sometimes what was your intention when your intention is the manipulate Evil cheat allsometimes we make a mistake that may result in like we had some arbitration or whatever but as long as the intention was clean and write it is not effective in the intention is wrong and after I learn from them intention is everything is my intention to eat an animal is example and set ok we have done this spiritual beings we should not give them our intention is very food is it goes back to the areas where there were no groceries and whole foods and now it's up to the right intentiondoing everything with the wrong intention and that is why were you on a psychedelic or not and stuff like that you know people API to judge people who are on psychedelic I will see this whole you know community in Goa judging the hippies 70 crime from the 20 000 child abuse from heppi is all the child abuse came from people who are educated who are you know have a lot of money all of the inner wall of the bad stuff happens when I was like who are you don't judge anyone some of the people who are mostritual and pray everyday and doing Pooja Jain in churches and staff are the various tasks you can't judge anyone all comes down to in tension tension tension invention a psychedelic works with the right intention is like that I have loads of friends left back in Goa today out completely did it with the wrong intention I have loads of people who have become business tycoon the billionaires Dev experimented with psychedelic Samiti jobs writes about in his own book for creativity he will come down to Indiayou go to Rishikesh you would use LSD and your go backwards begin Silicon Valley today people microdosing 1st ok my kudos means you take such a live youtech small microdox you can go to work but you can create you can talk you can be anything you are not like completely like in on a psychedelic trip is called microdosing It's become a new trend in Silicon Valley am I saying it's the right thing I think second value more of a fan with everything that comes and goes then what to write in tension people create music out of the cyclewhat happens in LSD Turban acid to so what I heard from most people have experience with 16 The Spiritual and the person I didn't open my mind I saw life differently to be completely differently when you do these things and was not like you can I get on a girl and pick up a girl and don't want to in fact you won't be away from people don't be any event space and stuff like that you feel like connecting with yourself and your my childhood memories come back to remember with conversations at a very young age nowKashmiri call I would not be able to do that but I speak lot of people I have some top Jewellers who before they create the design is a necessity of people in the music industry people who create animated cartoons to create films documentaries on everyone everyone finds a different source of inspiration and future channel it the right way it is only can result in something great it and let the wrong with good destroy your life and the people around you but Black Waterbiological level with the fires of urine II electric circuit effect of an

CBD oil serial half of them don't even understand how is working in the system by doing it because everyone doing so what is what is like the medical field perception of psychedelicsnothing like what happening there I was always going to be controlled at all it can be controlled right reasons for getting the biggest thing is a good gets out of control and if it gets out of control you can have people who are on psychedelic drugs and all that stuff driving doing different things so it comes under controlled substance and causes a lot of political controversy about white and governments are legalizing and why summer not the local time in Amsterdam in software is legal or Mein you know your rape happening nowyou know you are of that kind of Hero crime that happens in a place where is control the controversial subject and I'm sure there's a lot more people have before it goes on the state was kind of legalization alarm in the statistics show that triangle does fallen right to the bottom right there was no longer control in people misusing it is where is certainly something which is League you know if you if you like people human being wanna break rules are stronger rule the monument was the breaker something which is completely and now is out in the openpeople of tulunadu behaviour down so I've seen the destroyer people's lives and I've seen it like elevate people aware

that I need my peace it turn to alcohol that on the drugs to be all play user role in creating the right environment for the Utah teenagers and all that stuff like I said in colleges in staff is the cool factor throw your cool joint that the wrong intention to do it was so wrong intention to destroy the cooler you want to get means according to more effectivewhat does marijuana do for you will be mine most cases Rashi slows down to commit a change of behaviour completely was closed on yourself in the long term and long term its Roza yourself some people it may be greater than an ambitious about the Crusader happy just doing what I do like a simple job if people want to be created when you move on it slows you down like I said it's different people need to create music movies all that stuff they use it we all know that they open about a usersimple person movie interactive areas and staff can destroy you because it on a path which is Defined by a drug or taking not by what you really want to cause a confused a list of your mind so you want to do you really care about us a like I said it should come naturally you should not be pulled into it because you have to do it will be cool in everything comes to you and you are meant to do it you will do it no matter what will come tomorrow plant will find you actually my final segment in this podcast is shrooms mushrooms forabout people taking a look on Valley someone what happens in that trip is a very similar to I was is it something like that is completely different against Hamein psilocybin is basically is basically the psychedelic mushrooms that you know main kyu hai to see colours and Bubbles in all that everyone sees it differently some people decided to music and laughed in IT company your name is different for everyone involved are bred from different case studies of people you go out the seven hill stations in India over it growsKisi the cows eat in acting crazy and stuff like that in the ground is a reason it's not gonna kill you at the same time it can move your path to relieve the pressure going to a bad face in your life and sir new take something that make you feel so great the issue is if you use that will get you through life is addiction is addiction essay sample is that you know there is a lot of research on size even out and extractssoybean and use it in certain medical therapies again across the world is when you go back decades in decades this is what people use this is what people use you now and they figured out there so much more intuition that has moon tuition in more ways than we are more knowledge we are more opinion we are more so-called research and advanced server everyone hides behind Research and you find the most of the people who discovered the psychedelic are scientists in the process of their daily work realise theDiscover LIC website user on himself and you realise what it could do and I also realise how to describe people is always a balance in everything you do somewhat like the final advise you have Forever Young person watching this is very fascinated by this would just like your final advice I think you know I am I am want to give advice because people are they explore whether they want to or not whatever you can explore in life it doesn't have to be psychedelic everyone will want to expose something it sometimes you doing it do itattention on the right path within the framework of your law and everything else that's the way you know you do it because I think we have to respect the part that people may want to take like I'll tell you do most of the parent to safeguard the kids from drugs to order life they like keep a check on everything in the most drugs it's sad but it's the truth sometimes you gotta love freedom in the child is born to cord is cut your child has his own life you are you are therewap to know Charan give them security but you can't control daydreams you can't control how they gonna go they will go the way that the path is defined to be parents are open to dadisa the kids who are more honest to their parents day share it do parents are involved in all of these things to see in Goa liked it the parents are doing some fun funta kids don't grow up seeing it as something it is taboo in India anything which is tab you want to do it more do you want to do it more you want to do all that stuff settingrelax with that like I said as long as within the framework of the law when are harming us as we not having other people and you were not doing anything which is basically a legal his readers with these kind of of the centre or topics were called this be open to open the learning about it and use it safely at don't get obsessed by the world that like anal and head of it and you are just keep listening to the Ranveer show for interesting conversations like thatdon't get obsessed by the world that like anal and out of it and I just keep listening to the Ranveer show for interesting

government that they were a few industries in Navi Mumbai for not following pollution norms in the water of their turn Turquoise blue so that something closer to home so so over across the entire world across all different countries legislations there is a mark this respect for water or water the life it holds and the help that wateranother special episode of the Ranveer show we got nearly from Abhi and new fame talking about Secrets of the ocean friends who is possibly even the people I know he is the fuel behind Abhiyan newyeah I should speak I am the person who does all the reading and get a be involved in in all the different topics ke behaviour so I have to talk about the topic that fascinated me a lot of you just in terms of you realise a small you are those that like thisproblem one fourth of one fifth of the volume of that while and when you see the front view as a human me you really understand how small you are you looked down to see the colours of a stock Coral so address change your perspective that why I initially got that interested in the ocean and also coronavirus affected which was that only 5% of the world's oceans are discovered and 90% 95% are not so one of the main reasons foris and you know quite a lot of it if you watch this episode called high Seas on our planet where they were the Arctic sea ice on Netflix with David Attenborough talks a lot about the high Seas to the high Seas are those vast expanses of species which are not under any country's economic control so if you look between Asia and both the America's have vast area of the Pacific which is uninhabited which is hope in the snow country that isfishing trawlers out there anything that that's the open ocean so any have a brief space of the Atlantic also those two oceans very have a lot of space and have the Indian Ocean beyond Africa forth the high Seas open oceans where animals roam free and David Attenborough calls it the wild and lawless nature where no country is lost inside of riches of crazy so a lotyuddh the sea floor is a lot deeper than what we sing it is and sunlight only only reaches of the first I think about thousand 1 kilometre so beyond that sunlight doesn't Trickle because the water is a barrier to it and it doesn't reach to the absolute bottom so as you keep going further and further below its pitch darkness you have a Twilight zone and its pitch darkness and that is the part that we have not been able to explore as muchit is kind of crazy if only 5% of the world ocean the discover that need only 5% of the total species also possibly are discovered it is so many species of animals leopards cover for all you know the IBC Monsters at the bottom of the ocean the increasingof the mountains the air becomes a squares and it becomes very difficult to breathe similarly as we go deeper and deeper into the ocean atmospheric pressure becomes so high that Crush you closer to the earth is it is also because that you need specific vehicles at ghante ki donon Kaun deep dive that much that you did that much you'll probably be Crushto finding the right vehicle sining funding for those is quite difficult one of the Expectations that had gone out there actually taken samples of a few of crustaceans pron like creatures and take them back to decide them and to analyse them and in one of the strong like returns headphone plastic also then it is like we not only have plastic problem on land we have it at the deepest depths of our seasonal so plastic has gone where no man hasin terms of these critters at the bottom are they have you read about those creatures that the dangers are there but if it's a different world out there because you don't have any light coming so the Dynamics a completely different because you have sunlight everything is in abundance if you go to forest the life is very abundant over that she will have some light still have a lot of plants and as a result you have plant eaters and then to counter the plant eaters you'll have the coronavirussecond hand tyre ecosystem but down there is completely different different light each creature has adapted to it to have something called bioluminescence If you saw the Firefly kind of finding Nemo finding to the depths and the point where the story is stalking and they had this angler fish that it has a light on its headyou have creatures like that are down there which depend on self generated light to catch Prey you also have corals down as it is a completely different one interesting thing I'd read about so this is this creature called the sperm whale which is one of the biggest lizard killer whales are cause a dangerous much sperm is a problem second in that category and if you study any sperm whalebody have this Battle Scars on them they have liked thoughts and like to say that just like in the skin elements card and disease that sperm whales battle with giant squids so the square roots that we eat like it like that we looked at a special there are those small square is called giant within an even larger with it having been supported by humans in the recent past at all the Colossal squid and it wasSonu ke deep sea creatures a spare like they're supposed to be a shoes Colossal squid I don't remember the ships and all that sailed around a lot of us had reported seeing Colossal squid then some people reported seeing Colossal squid and sperm whale battles which is the crazy is hard because I mean I don't think people understand how large waves are actuallyunderground underwater Battle of a flight have you heard of this whole thing about how even Bombay Swadeshi like her Mumbai is built on reclaimed land and how we use two wheeler Cayman Islands and the weather as well as the energy when you go to new places on energy of the place was very similar to Goa and it had a lot of marine life in factJuhu Beach to publicize what is 175 year old uncle who had grown up in the same house which was on Juhu Beach to hear it seems to be changed over time difference between then and now and he said that it the water was so clear that you could enter job it go ways the inaccuracy fashion do things like stingrays would come upvery close to human beings you could even like dolphins on the beach and all that which again started happening after the lockdown started with dolphins came came New Bombay but it just makes you think that shit like human beings and really messed up messed up of three different components of how we measure of the system so one component is the sort of stuff we put into our waters like in Bombay they don't have a sweetso that a group called marine life of Mumbai lakes you on walks around the Mumbai shows to try and Discover my life that is there on those rocks just as you enter the sea creatures that is native to Mumbai Airport still being discovered an absolutely wonderful and if you guys are going on a walk with the sky is butnow you just wait for the locked and get done so there as well those guys tell me that there are so many different creatures on Mumbai is sea shore the coastline and stuff like that and and at one of those works one of the volunteers told me that of the course to wally I guess around five or ten kilometres deep into the Arabian Sea that the pipe with all orders which comes and just MTS weather and apparently this is like one blackspot in the see you know that is how can mauke the whole thing is it is everything that goes from our household from maybe industries of what I was so all of it is go straight into the water so whatever pollutants we put into the water that kind of disrupts the entire cycle because that's one thing water body is naturally have a capability of killing themselves and repairing themselvesso even if you have a lot of up to an acceptable level of pollutants or bacteria or something like that the water can cleans itself if you have more fresh whatever comes in the water can clean itself but beyond the point if you keep polluting it the rivers a river or any water bodies ability to regenerate stocks that what happened to the Yamuna today has so much ofpollutants raw sewage and stuff that goes into it that the river doesn't have any ability to regenerate itself or to be capable of supporting any life with just water but is not water with life and I feel like that's what we have ended up doing in this past century or so you have not been very mindful of the fact that you know there is an entire ecosystem That depends on water so that has happened so that is in terms of whatever discharge andsecond thing where Oceans and any water body has suffered his fishing if you look at it you have regular small-scale individual-level fishing which if you go to our costume Humko is and staff will take their boats and go on the official will come on the other hand in developed countries you also have commercial fishing see you have 20 big dollars I will go out with nets that is just catch all the fish in the sea and their refrigerated can attendit so a lot of damage to the ecosystems in emotions is done by The Scholars by commercial fishing who will fish indiscriminately Lake the entire logic of nature is that if you take something that you leave something back so that you let it region rate with commercial fishing the same principles haven't been followed as a result so many species of fish have been in overfishedpopulations in the sea are not able to read and read the message as fast as a fishing these problems facing and that is why 75 year old uncle said he pahle Kaisa tha pahle Juhu Beach was really clean and now it's not it's not because we're throwing over a group in it and whatever life is there were not respectthink about the actual life in the ocean if you actually have read about the kind of readers out there which are discovered by men that the court as for example it's still always like free wali Chhatri the fascinated me since my childhood because of river in reading about it these creatures are so intelligent that other populations of them all over the world and each of these populations or se and Indian ocean or ka in his behaviour will be very different from an organism Mania Sweden andbecause they will develop their own cultural heritage with the Atlee pass on to the children they are the technique of hunting with the activities that it for example near I think the South Pole the altars De De in primary eat the seals and to kill the skills they have a particular technique where they will isolate a seal on a batch of Ice and then and two or three orders will attack it in a group and bullet to kill a turn on the hunting techniques are passed on to the kidsflight orders training the kids in the doing things and it's crazy to think of that kind of Intelligence in Europe a wild animal and also how this year that ok dolphins are actually even smarter than dogs the same intelligent Rusi dogs Dolphin the even more head and in fact humpback whales each each group of Hamburg will have their own particular songhumpback whale swimming se and they meet another they actually observe this is a group of whales am sorry I don't know the English word for what is called a group of Hamburg Wales Swayam towards Australia and animate another group of Ham backwards and the first group and of course because they singing all the time there is no calling out all the time the make a lot of clicks and a lot of different sounds by humpback whale sound is actually by beautiful soSahi long beautiful so then they met the second group of that they interacted with them and then they decided Achcha I like the second group song much more than mine adopted the second group song also they have cultural exchanges also where you know this is my song but I like your song so then think I will use your song only it so wonderful that this sort of sharing going on between them and dynamic ways but you know you think of somelike Turtles very live for like 150 years and 200 years I have read that about saltwater crocodiles also from not mistaken at the saltwater crocodiles live for really long life hundred 120 is normal or not with salt water or some other kind of species but there is this really cool story at 10 in the Joe Rogan experience I read somewhere that basically there was a group of Japanese soldiers somewhere in Vietnam and they were getting ready to ambushsend me so to Ambush hiding inside the lake and before they could actually I am bored the enemy the crocodiles inside the legs are attacking all the Japanese soldiers were killed login Ta battalion and the scariest thing is that the same problem as it probably killed the soldiers in World War II was still alive today because because slidable along like this from the 1800South mein receive your lack of knowledge and a lack of respect for Ocean life amongst people that arise from throughout our respect for people you see people animals you see you automatically respect dogs because you are exposed to dogs a domesticated animal you are exposed to kittens and an inner wish you have videos of someone beating them more here202 Singh effective on a personal level and you can see it was similarly for any other domesticated animal of farm animals you can see their plight in front of you we can't see the plight of fish who are being overfished you know your Sharks that are being killed which are you know absolutely critical to maintain the balance of an ecosystem included within people are not noticing that the entire ecosystem is collapse people can't hear coral reefs manclose commercial fishing nets were dragged across the corals and Coral server 40000-50000 you will probably never grow back 40000-50000 your am sorry I gotta keep bringing it back to the Monsters only because they are the deep sea once rates than the ones you can't see you then the people or the ages can see them could reach them but now we can now I can with whatever means of transport the we havebishops and commercial knowledge on the thickness of changing International conscience I don't see a changing like what would use to happen was initially a Wales a blue whales were among the few ways they were being hunted to extinction at one point of time I think the three Lakh Wales and they were dangerously close to extinction and they were hunted internationally because the usedsome part of the whale in perfumes customer ko something some part of a bag contains some just because something which is used in in perfumes and stuff like that it's a lot of different then it happened was that they started to actually show footage of this happeningdidi short footage of people killing us where more than blood spewing across the ocean and then other lifting goes wale Sun and seeing the there just lying there and that's a spark the conscience of a lot of people and they said to have to stop killing the ways and as an international agreement ok we will stop hunting wheels and as a result of the add-in 20-30 years where population study to see an increase because you had an international agreementso unless you are an international agreement on something like fishing or on the side of a discharge you doing in the water it it is it good to change and a fair bit of his responsibility is with corporate with with companies that Dum power of toxic Chemicals on a large scale the responsibility is also known as fast fashion fashion brands of that so use contributed to a water pollution inif you actually Google photos of it if you check out Google assistant is this one area in China that makes washed jeans the genes that they have to give the adverse effects of that they have to put it through to three different chemical processes if you see the water outside that then its blue blue but is not natural dark jeans wala blue similarly you have an area again in Chinawhich they manufacture hats for Christmas Santa Claus wala area outside that is it feels like does it ever of blood so that's that have a days and I'll give you an example not so far away from home then they were there was one case of I think an NGO covid-19 Shakti had taken it up with the government that they were a fewindustries in Navi Mumbai 11 not following pollution norms in the water of their turn Turquoise blue so that something closer to home so so over the entire world across all different countries legislation is this respect for water for water the life it holds and the help that waterHappy ki lockdown ki recipe pollution kam ho raha hai but now everything is started unlocking so you see that whatever battles are going back unfortunately that we live on excessive consumption and your GDP of manufacturing which means that you actually have to manufacture more products you have to create more productcreate more products we also have significant amount of waste and those in need not every polluter will actually end up paying the price it will be people who end up paying the price for about people will end up paying the price of you read about this Mexican fisherman who had washed ashore we write the story The Crazy story he was accused of a friend they both kind of got swept away like in a stormThe Mexican village but it's worth two in the Pacific Ocean and I think about hundred days after being swept away something that friend went insane because of just being outlined on Lost in the ocean and according contact anyone and this guy apparently he was out there for more than two years in the audience was having a surviving on rainwater and your surviving on the eating raw fission and finally landed up near some very remote Pacific Island so that they start the podcast you mentioned thathigh Seas he got slapped window part of the high Seas where almost no trawler has ever been no big ship has ever been washed out to like probably the most isolated part of the other in the sea is near the poles so that crazy thought and when that's when you realise the power of the ocean what it can isolated from bhajan going to be part of this planet was not a single you will be before your husbandI mean the thing is we tend to focus on on on on the world in terms of another countries are the places that you can see we often ignore that the earth is called the blue planet is called the blue planet for a reason because most of its area is covered by some form of water body on the other hand you read anything about things like the Megalodon Megalodonancient version of the Shark our adda tell you that in the deep sea is there is a species called camera which is 82 metre long Shark which is the answer of our modern life if you think so that thing about the thing that we ignore when it comes to our Ocean is that the ocean is the reason that we were unable to survive as we areespecially given climate change and stuff like that we think what the oceans even doing for all of these years is whenever we produce a lot of carbon dioxide and sheet the carbon carbon dioxide reproducible absorb a lot of heat and what the ocean seven doing is 7:00 absorbing the heat for us so raven reducing the impact of whatever has been happening for so long and now they've reached the critical point they can't absorb heat for a very long time we can absorb as much heat is a used tosecondly that has a big implications because of that means there is more heat in the atmosphere which is coronavirus heat of the earth faster and then cause more problems with the whole Domino that people tend to forget is because oceans cover majority of our planet you have these tiny oceanik plants that are called phytoplankton you and I can't see them than that have the whole Marine ecosystem star still have these tinyphytoplankton that is then feed small fish fish and then the smaller fish eaten by the efficient because that's how the whole chain goes on these phytoplankton actually recycle all the nutrients from the fishery and e waste the fish believe all the main features of mammals is well as all of the ways to be recycled by the phytoplanktons will absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and produce oxygen is well do we actually overlordoxygen in the atmosphere to these creatures to every time we use any product or will leave anything some anything that goes into our sink or drain sliders chemical native to be mindful that it might hurt the very people were creating a oxygen in the first place that one of the main reasons why whenever I talk I tell people try to go chemical free in terms of you know your soaps and shampoos for you know anythe product you may use on your face not only for your own benefits because you don't know what Chemicals are putting your body but for the Chemicals that you unwanted liya putting out in the world into the oceans in our water bodies that I want to do this kind of people up to the world of oceans final question on the episode is what do you think the next 10 years who had was discovered about the oceans will be discovered New parts ofwill we discover a new species what do you think I would I think the next 10 years we will Discover how you not to sound tomorrow scored in the next 10 years will probably discard this cover how badly we are impacted the oceans and possibly if International consensus happens we will starting steps regulated we will start figuring out model wearemissions can be treated by discharges can be treated effluent can be treated and as as consumers as individual households we figure out a model where we can use natural products that don't harm this week we discovered a lot of a species a lot of species in the deep season left we discovered that the problem is for those Expectations is also quite costly unless you are funding for them to go deep seas and then explore the screenmaybe discovering more critters Mera Bipasha what do you think about that I think is out there possibly a lot of smaller creatures that we have no idea about possibly the giant creature creature was actually that is one fish for fish which is like a really thin over which has a gives that have slightly machine on them so that looks like a se light Ja Rahe that fishes live10 metres long wow the Avenue you find more creatures like that in deep space am sure only if there is more funding to us that but I feel more funding should go towards making sure that our oceans can read and write them and a lot of this will happen if we make a international laws for commercial fishing and then you have different communitiesin islands or in coastal areas that take care of the oceans so a lot of times what happens is we expect lawmakers and loss to take care of areas but if you task communities or people to take care of the results are better so you need to have no fish loans to have particular time so there you don't fish need to basically have some sort of an international consensus on this more talk on itEmo talk on it because in the oceans are critical to our survival in the oceans create are clouds the oceans manager temperatures and ocean sustain us so the more we started talk about it in public domain the battles can be awesome thank you on the topicfrom Abhiyan you will come back with another powerful power back topic

so what my weight lossAtul Khatri and Jose covaco to your very different than the stand up comedy space or gently people I meet on a day to day basis very very different energy so you feel that about yourself do you feel like something stand out from the crowd in terms of Stand up comedy acting yes I amI have the energy I mean as a person I am free hai per energy and like a gun at home my daughter sabji papa school Don cold this is always been there somewhere inside a still from younger brother 52 years old so that thing comes from there and in fact and support the comedian's why is called interact with also like you know of stage and the green room and all you know I am from the guy who is it don't feel I'm old enough to live with itI think I have the same thing to say about you like when someone ask me about this particular episode all the things I wish to ask my parents but I probably can't like it I can talk to you about anything but let's begin with your Oz story what exactly what are you doing before stand up because there is confusion about the some people say you are so I am busy your own businesses so whats the truth soIT company in Bombay K Tech computers is still there it was being my brother and some other people and the directors who is the CEO of the company so I got of Engineering way back later it is then I worked out side and then I came into this company and I was running the sales and service path to sell computer networks servers in a Cisco network Sinha and I wish to maintain networks andinfrastructure of high clients like 200 computers for entertainment in the service and the networks across India a good nice team as I did that for close to 25 years and that was what I was doing prior to me getting into comedy or trying to sort of the age of 44 I decided to get into it and not Hotel want to leave it started as a liquid has a bucket list started as a wife called midlife crisisgirls Panda enjoying it so much that after four years after starting it I could that and got full time to stand up comedy to your story again but you mentioned this word in midlife crisis is something I didn't leave me alone because your send me your job is to observe people when you observe in your friends what is this midlife crisis made up of what happens and what is it could you explain the abcs of our generationsoon after college the pressure to get into work business and things like that so I think when you are when is a better life is no 40 is Ne 40 is a typical in at Summit life you live up to 70 80 so what is the midpoint satisfaction that the mid comes from and that's when you start realising the hey you spend 20-25 years doing you know just running around trying to set up in your work your childrenfamily and that's all it took a head there was no no no no It's Now or Never underestimate was that so somewhere at the age of 43 44 started feeling the heat this is more to life than just this you I can't be doing this for the next twenty thirty years is running around in trying to please my employer is my the government the tax is my my my clients into some where it has to be some something for your own personal also has to be there has to be one differentwhich is a personal growth is no I mean you can't at the age of 6571 a retired and that we should really bother me when I think of a know that is really bother me that at the age of 35 I am in a retired and maybe not can't do anything more I will say oh my god addition it right this if you don't cry then you have to be blamed for trial you don't succeed and it's ok so it was actually that and to be honest with my wife really Agni on she said head why didn't you I canIT job your great burn out because it is actually 24/7 365 dni maintaining these are my Kasim Indian people very high and Critical service failed the call at 3 a.m. in the morning hey my server is down somewhere in this range for some resources to set it out and then you have to do it and so it was

to achieve their employees salaries to a paid and running a business in India waiting anywhere else small-medium sized business is extremely challenging in terms of the buck stops here so unless your can you know other people's money that if you think but so you are so I think that's what and Ek Bar Mein Wi-Fi said now I have to try something new soactually it was started it was a plan decision let me try something else other than just doing my work day in and day out so I started to this writing midlife crisis really hate u there was a time when children are growing up and you know it is possible to come up so it's trying to U no problem satisfy sum of a need somewhere that now let's look in forward and say that how can you do something for yourself what were you at 27 weeksyou at this age where you Janu decided to take this call what was the difference in your mind set at 27 ettinger was more focused towards my work it was full work how to increase your business sales how to keep your clients happy how to we must manage things around starting those at that time the goals of very different know the age of 44 when I started doing comedy it was a very different state of mind reset ok this is going on you done it well andthe time I left my work we were highly profitable it was all that was a dying business in order to get ordering I was you doing well I'm Sandeep Businessman we make money with out of out of a loss because I was shut 44 it was the same feeling I am still doing well but there is some relations are not coming that I am getting old now you know and now you have to have been a great start coming in your eyesight goes to be at 40 in your reading glasses come on you know thatsome changes happening with either Now or Never what about all those stand up comic you met when you begin what is the difference in mind that there because I just feel age as a lot of layers to your head and Sanam comics is the nature of business and economics study constantly adding layers your head so you feel like the youngest an account of very different from you are the very different from even today in different 23 24 is very youngyou know you build on stage is writing is impeccable everything is perfect but there is the business side toward there is the UNO Samay I mean I am and I am spoken of chemical share in the head also and special today mean of kids age how old are you sorry 27 age of affairs should have to get married to find some we get married have children that the children are going to school arrange and any furtherbig bird in order of kids am getting around in married at first and they feel that its responsibilities agriadda Dispersion of world now which is getting so polarized which is becoming very negative and becoming so in a difficult that IT field but so coming back to your questions and I made this comedians of is a young they were carefree in a free-spirited as they would call it the sum of the ages tomorrowthis is writing for them just sitting at home hold a long and incoming the night to comedy that was the thing for me it was like us to work in the morning from 8326 30 and 18 at workplace carry my jeans t-shirt change into my office toilet at 637 not changed into this shirt type jacket get these cool clothes in go to some possum club to perform Hero Jo Kaisa every night I feel like in ASM Clark Kent to the toilet Chennai to Superman is going out to save the worlddifferent but generally and learnt a lot from this paper we know it's not that I mean I give credit to every young person has taught me so much you know I summerfield it's a new lease of life for me I did something for 25 years of a good chunk of my life time may be one third of my life time I didn't is it in your running a different Orbit you have your you have your ecosystem of your clients suppliers you that others know you you jump out of that planetcannot do different parrot exam fresh when are you are having had young comedians writing a creative job in a going to comedy clubs performing across the world with different issues very different ecosystem altogether privilege that I got a chance reason the lifetime to pursue two different extremely Pola a different not polarizing very different environments but what do you see that starkly different aboutthis generation that people might what do you think is great and what do you all think is Dil Mein stuff I think what is amazing great you do you know this you can I don't think too much love for the future I don't know I will it would be very interesting but I think it's a it's a It's a rising is a very the Uber model that I need not buy a car have a nobody not buy house I can rent it out a need not you know you have 10000 in accounts let's go for a trip to Lonavala for the weekend I am until Tuesdaywill earn more money so far as more of Savings and always protecting the features that for you know my parents taught me like it's always about saving planning your future Singh that you are those which funds and all what if one day you nothing happens to have something to it was a good in a way so that the other thing which I would like to tell people is to please Hero like isolecithal comedians that what happens in a comedy you know an open my car comes it was very well for 303open mic and forth before the 4th of May make it quits his job as a job in this is my passion this is my calling and then 56 open mic doesn't well certainly doesn't get the followers and then you know finally you need money to pay your bills to you survive an is your reach father will find you for the rest of your life you you you require all this to to sustain so I always say it may be very calculateapproach and that I get a lot of time to mittens young Communism what should I do and I do not know the parents of spoken to make up my son is saying that I want to leave my study job which gives him a good 40 50000 rupees and I discussed the comedian I like I've had this discussion is a reason why do you want to leave your job you know it's something I was doesn't allow me to do it as it wait wait for six months to see where your pros and cons for like assistant 6 7 8 10 awning enough money from your from this Passion of your switchthen you and your confident you are doing well and you really want to this get into this for lifetime then Jump then take this decision because a comedy even though it may seem very easy it may seem very fine and it seems very spotting is a lot of hard work which goes into writing jokes in a special today's time when you have WhatsApp joke setting you cannot 200 jokes for every minute is hitting on your phone and social media and memes in some new things and Somi such creativeare coming now you have to rise above that was a newborn stage when people come to pay your money that is a oh my God it's worth paying him jokes only internet pack of either that should not be that was generally have seen as in the media Industry that especially the acting World adventure YouTube work it was a stand up comedy or is it a bit of a rat race like at least people I know its not but people perceive it like that like I know all three are individualyoutubers are enjoying their work and design drawing winforms sainikon is minimal Living out their dreams by performing on stage but somewhere a lot of people has it become the rat race and if you like the joy of the whole ecosystem kind of drained away because of that sort there is a rat race if you know if your YouTube YouTube YouTube per your rat race to the how many subscribers and adding month on month that is one know because there is matrix system givenbuy platform for me follows you have how many views did you get how many comments should you get me like Caesar way this like you got so those are you know created by the platform created by society so that way only you know you are sort of your judging yourself but I genuinely believe that if you are if you like I am telling honesty I am not negative but I don't read any comments at all because it can throw you off your the reason as you these questions are only see you and routeris probably the two guys are met not in the second space general in the whole social media space you guys don't look at a very Joyce about the alarm at me because we all had that contrast before maybe maybe because you know I'll be honest it you earlier to sell computer where we were making like maybe that I am and I'm not joking you can make a thousand rupees on selling a computer is given example you make at the margin you make a thousand thousand years on selling a computerit may take you one week in terms of the transaction your client calls you give my court he comes back he completes the composite 1 and 6 other vendors in your fighting on the phone was this reason we should give it to me then you deliver the computer you install it keep am happy for your thousand rupees is what you make saigon for those you know so for me this is very very good and so we're so privileged that person stand up comedy where it's a new art10 years old that all comedians in a long way to go I think we're just the tip of the Iceberg and I do 78% of India is laudable seen what we are that don't doesn't know that we exist and that today when we would go to a comedy show even in Bombay and we ask you how many of you watching Comedy Show for the first time we were surprised 50% of the people in life of which they watched on YouTube on Netflix Quora what life 50% 6a room put the hands when did you last purchase livecomedy tell me before the lockdown interview this is how you doing what I believe is that all these three art forms with the struggles that acting for example been there for decades yours hundreds of yours so that those are different challenges for example acting you compare the acting is stand up comedyI have gone for auditions for movies for ads and it is brutal the casting I will call you want a severe looking at exactly for a person like you salt by no salt pepper hair so looking so you looking doctor looking and please come Surfers audition ahead you think that maybe two guys were there you go there is no ordinary 200 guys also looking also looking all the paper will fit and all actors have an actorand that's the kind of completion you have so even in youtubers I think other the annular your YouTube pay you the video which you make with your heart with the soul you know you know you had fun on it you know you know your original you not copied everybody is idea it has to do well in comedy we know they think all the fourth wall Soni when you're on the stage is a wall and the right one on the right and left the wall behind the audience is a fourth wallmost intelligent what they can see whether you are lying or not like as long as your true to your are formed in a you go Papon stage address it and the audience can see that you are not like that it is a very pure artform stand up comedy you cannot lie you cannot fit on stage and the audience respect that nothing just to suffer some of your question I think is just whatever you do a possible thanks to YouTube and Sony platform that no entry level barriers and acting there are some where you may have to know Karan Joharstudy struggled a lot but if your original your funny potato video rod reel the Sonipat from w 30 second year of 15 second insta story you have a Innova 451 minute I ji TV Ji video so so many platforms are well whatever your art form is there do it and if your funny you will you not do well you know like for example Yashraj mukhate nobody knew him for 6 months ago 8 months ago today is not like millions of followersmusicians around the around India want to collaborate with him nothing if a guy from Aurangabad important you have to be true it off and keep on keep on doing it keep on doing it keep on doing it till you had gold because your 40 + under you seem Birbal stories played out in front of you you are so what are you doing negative patterns are you so early on in your life in other people may be your who went down wrong baths of faded away write a better word forinducible Srinagar flight was happening with like the young people you meet in the media space ok just not comparing comedians anything you have to recognise the Trends allow people initially shunned social media what is Instagram what is better what is Facebook can I am I want to protect my personal life at which is fire free fire fire and fair enough for you if you want to do that will listen you have to sell tickets that's sure to come because kids nowadays stop reading newspaper your watchingwhere do you go to buy tickets on social media for not yourself on social media 2000 followers on Instagram and then you complain that my tickets are not selling of these figures only those two thousand people are watching out of that also highly 50 this order with 10 people buy a ticket with two other word of mouth tickets in Celsius or alive artist performer you have to good or bad it yourself social media you have to come out it's it's you are you know it's a struggle everyto come up with content and some people to such a great job of it like I get amazing she like Dolly Singh Kusha Kapila projector in every Dev churning out something that they were plan in mind is not that the wake up and they also get exhausted but this is a proper plan to it and and that's why they are as popular as they are they got Bollywood rolls movies coming their way and think leather Netflix coming there was it is hard work which finally page and enjoying that they don'tI'm sure some of the bad days of the day was kicking themselves up and say hi let me put this up because my friends are waiting for me to do something is very important soap I see only people who have not would not stay relevant to the time you know what it is like when for example on Instagram can go to the real I could forget it yet but I attended that Instagram seminar with explain to us what really I put out some real and I am enjoying it I'm enjoying the format you know is like Europe area inSunil Gavaskar 200 runs get tired and going to the pavilion and not feel because he's tired but today you have to feel of your to bol also plus your to bat also with the format change from fayde change into T20 you can't you have an all rounder that's what I've I believe in saying that you have to recognise what are the platform coming in acknowledge them don't show them away see what are the trains coming in as much as possible what were your limitations and your strengthsand let us know if you want to be out especially in a in our business where you have to be continuously out there in terms of this also one of the things which are seen people following is because sometimes a over expose themselves like in a line what happens is that this actually I give credit where is the US who I am matter matter about some few years back and he explained to me saying that listen don'ts when people come to watch after comedy show this should be a base price that at this price is what I want to Seattleyou know you can't be one day performing 15 ticket exiting of Re show some where is it showing 800 rupees ticket summarise the audience will get confused to what is worth you know if you go from where is the show the front to take its always minimum 15 under 2 2000 rupees in the cheapest season 50 rupees so that the work he is attached to his ticket price at work Savere 2802 shows and is crowd will dissipate and they will not stop this the sum of the things to see many comedians do that in a with theirconfusing signals and then they complain no 20 buying my tickets on my my my my market value is not increasing obviously because you yourself have created in sublime I should also make it a point when any organise a come to me and said that they had to leave the show I discuss what might even though his wake me up front for the entire show I need not be bothered with what he is charging his patrons I ask him what is the front row ticket price please keep it at this why don't even though your making money from the sponsor but don't under tell me or nottell me a broad Sindhi business layer and combined it with egolessness and I feel that usually when people a what

collective they do this we should do that is it playpresent don't unnecessary complete theorem yourself like I Shahrukh Khan one said you know I only completed myself I don't computer anybody has said that is all that is being equal to about it but that generally it is as an actor you try to raise the bar and every acting you do as a comedian we try to write OK 6s back this was my writing style have a broad something have learnt have a change myself have a learnt something more and my next writing Shubhamget over yourself feel very happy about it and I think I have a look at my writing 7 years back 8 years back and now it is definitely changed it has become better I become a learner I am reading a lot I am observing a lot more I am I know what is right what is not right it is back you know a lot of us in school with two column based on a Kaliya Emo to know you realise that it's not rightMoto all my friends because in this in this to call me but which of these will realise of prospects will call you double battery in Bombay if you know there is a typical if your party or baba your Mac or market nowadays the noise and become what you cannot all this thing you know more as a if you have not been in this comedy life has to be still think about somewhere be that guy you knowwho is not soul I would say educated enough so you can mention one of the to it that my co-founder Road Viraj he basically mentioned that these so there is vo containers over hope I get of India every second even say like you know what I like about the smallest things andthe whole point of them being over work is about the meaning accepting they wanna say that ok I am Rider accept what it called variety in gender am radio access variety in brief summary to accept variety and people but if you go in the ideologies even a little bit they will Pounds at you that that thattime during the luxuries parental angst the coming out is really they may be what is also happen due to realise a social media really polarizers you social dilemma that they are trained to polarizer and it is I can you can see it in the last four days absent leave I saw this one youtuber Gaurav come to India and when I was going to Varanasi for trips are searching for good food in worldthe land of this one food blogger some goraj to three of them to come to India I forget the name right now and last 3 days when open Facebook religious popping me those videos of food bloggers you know what food to eat where what do you know what to do what to do in India Pakistan last four days adjustment resume is the best food in Pakistan Lahore I will never go there may be on Iran or in Malaysia in some awesome Hindu in China which is the best chicken to eat their social history as a today livewhat do that I will go in WhatsApp also is exactly what happen when you are so work automatically all social media just you know starts showing you the super work Idea you or I will tell you people who to follow the superb works guys and it was it automatically take you there if you watch social dilma what we spoke about that thing on Netflix when he said the and you must follow some other people who are against the opposing of your views that you get to balance account which is so importantso I can do a political my political ideology is that unless you can do something about it don't have extremely strong opinions on and I think most of your most people were extremely strong political opinions my not talking BP audio is different but in the twenties it's like the lesson the ambition the more extreme the political opinion so either very hard core I take a hard-core lapping and use it for not doing much for the life I will it if you won't have a really strongRTO office solutions also work towards something but that's just my opinion and follow the social principle of following all the extreme left extreme ride more political people and I genuinely feel that the healthy practice but it's not something that is going to happen in our time I think I see how the extreme left of Sunday only following all the same the extreme right but anyway have youwho directed The Hangovermy teenage and my childhood weather was a lot of Ben stiller movies 2020 in comedies that uses that just doesn't happen any more so someone asked what will be the same question is why don't you directly from the world of comedy movies need you I am not going to recommend this is not the age of comedy comedy died like Wrong Turn your back on social media came up because he's like if you even Go and watch The Hangover item that is AC and The Hangover Alan the slider Chandigarh he takes a baby's hand and moviebabies getting off if you do that now you're probably find people get offended by hundred percent is there are jokes on mexicans and then movie and everything India is a country that is often shows America America it is often overlooked the small Todd Phillips said that is not the age of comedy movies and give you the other flip side so that is like 34 gents of youtubers in India pdfwould be myself Nikhil protector Bhuvan Ashish 3rd gen would be like a slayy point and all the people you seem right now that you know the gaming devices and their inventors of origin is extremely Dank thank you most like very often sleeping with 10 years of you know their Daba Ke Rakho doll the offensive jokes come out in one offensive volcano in the health is that my hope but what do you think of this like what do you see habol Androidthe comedy on the nature of comedy is evolved over time and user comedy is a reflection of the society v11 so do you what do you think that is volcano Dank Meme page on Instagram have a hurry dark I think in terms of your comedy as such that some people enjoy like this on and off the record on the record I am ok with it but I love da Comedy like I amjokes make it my daughters and my wife Restaurant New York and crying and my mum and dad you like it burnt alive if you say with you can't even think about how you thinkis that the angst of not being able to show 10 we should have like it but it is one of the few moments before the section got this to be held on the ground and also has to be these different groups they have a meeting at this bara bara Kaman have attended a meeting the formand I support the I am not any of these data support the moment the reasons why are some friends over from the lgbtq community and ice to go there for the meetings and is to be so much fun and it would but was like this happened to 13 of to 4:30 visit in the outcome was them and things like that in a cell that we should have one of these dark Comedy Nights with to just SMS is in an office at ke has a dark comedy night happening come here and this error is coming and in opening up and removing thethe angst and people have to take jokes literally don't take them so seriously I don't get offended live today I'm telling you know the kind of as a comedian as a as a as a Twitter as a person is very active on Twitter you know it I can I am that change as seen that change where are you write the most positive thing you know instilled l bi vi gas will get offended and flipped around it's aI got off and it is also said that guys have a sense of humour college don't get any and I think he was referring to his own works because he said that in college life and all in your college life don't take so much so so so seriously just have a sense of humour injoy like it like that it wasn't just give a children's sense of humour that said that they will survive for the rest of their life with their sense of humour most important to get you through the darkest of timesIndia typing test happening every outfit that it's happening every when it's over exposure to its today you have actually a tool today you can send it to Narendra Modi and it Meri He Meri day tour to Amitabh Bacchan my time 15 years back you to know the address it lives it noto write a letter in or take a paper write a letter post it good the post office Kota stamportal noise like is there just throw stones at him directly that that's actually that's why people are getting more affected during that Dank volcano in India at least it may takes it is still be very underground moment you know everything because even though we have a very rich culture of comedy as as a nation know that this is a10 years old but doesn't comedy from many other than may be created an event in Marathi theatre Akola Deshpande in Sony guys in Punjab and in down south has always been you know Akbar Birbal what is that that is all about University and jokes and things like that enough you always had a court Jester comedy has always been a part that is now that you know building no offence to it and as inviting Ricky Gervais said you can say anytimejoke you can joke what anything you want you know if you really if you take it in the literal sense but what happens in India as a comedian also you know we are we are performing in different different like last year were performed in Agra Udaipur Udaipur with the first time in history of Udaipur it across that stand up comedy what happens first time ever the show was happening first ever hadyou know mimicry Raju Srivastav knowledge in but this isn't the first time ever enough people turned off the show know what happens is that most of them are watching stand up comedy for the first time I would 90% of some of them would have travelled abroad and what should become the responsibility of the comedian also to see that you Don't scare them away from the best dark jokes this is that good for this is not comedyin certain Modi ko insulted Rahul Gandhi U no no no no this is not is not good but becomes unresponsive the comedian to go and see that the accepted the room read the room and start with simple Sindhi jokes Marwadi jokes Punjabi jobs in over the better part of every standards act like you're going on stage and actually sense the energy and alter your jokes always always it and you have to let something that happens is that that you know youthe host will tell you are the event organiser he know say what you want is all adult crowd say what you want you know and you and see what it is most obedient visitors Chowk to see whether they really are they prepared to do that or no and within like first performance we come to know whether its audience is very conservative a very open to take whatever kind of jobs and you stole it take them to donate them so hard in history that they were my god forget it is not fall within stand up comedy such an art form that the audience decides to like you thelove you then you can take the for 2 hours or so but if you do say something wrong on stage the first three months and they are all in a gang up against you then you centre for 4 days also they will still not like you so that's what comedy as it becomes in response to the commitment to see that you Don't scare away the audience is it would have gone and I know that have a cut dog jokes sorry no 2 mini sex jokes in that Udaipur and outcome would have the Jokereven sell tickets with no we don't want to stand up Comedy Kapil Sharma the world but I want to say that you know a lot of young kids we don't like Kapil Sharma and all that but generally speaking you know the time of comedy he does on on on agc on on TV in his amazing great job because I was married jobs observation jobs for it does but you have to see his hands are tied on TV on radio on FM you can't say for example you can't sendModi always column honorable Prime Minister you can't say Muslim you to save member of the minority community together word you cannot say you cannot ship to always call refer to the regional political party the under those circumstances you can't do politics you can do sex you cannot do we come to the very very privileged we can go on stage and say what the hell we want you know but their hands and in spite of all that you know he's been holding the audiences for 5 yearsgreat job in an amazing job how does your English stand up comedy Aravind stand up comedy look at people like Sunil Pal Raju Srivastav Navin Prabhakar all those big I grow up I my India my inspirations at that time there was no you know he's not that the time we have no access to what George carlin for you know for the old comedians worked with some tips and all is to come but if the first ever watched wasn't at all inthis was Eddie Murphy the delete that came on some VHS you know where after my god is abusing so much on stage and that is just the fact that We're Young growing up summarises the effort and time do you need to get excited to see how is saying all these things is talking about sex Ichapur making love on stage and this my god this is that for Sakshi stand up video ever watched but I'm coming at your question Johny liver Raju Srivastav Sunil Pal the Indian Laughter Challengegrow up 2010 be there are some of the times have gone because they should do typically rely on mimicry and at that time I am just to let you know I have made this you I was performed in Gujarat with this I forget a generous but he was is a very popular comedian in Gujarat with mimicry and you are having lunch and he acknowledging Siya from rr from memory is going to die as a way to say that increases during our timeaap the actress has a strong personalities and voices you know right Dilip Kumar had a style Rajkumar is coming to Jaani and you know somebody else to do something else are you know Ashok Kumar hairstyle every actor had his own style in a single today all these young crop Ranbir Ranbir you know his other than today's problem Saif Ali Khan is still has something to himself in the rest of the new crop they themselves are changing character every movie they don't have avoice you know maybe fuel and Nawazuddin Siddiqui you know or affan Khan later Funk and had a in a personal very difficult style writing so difficult to mimic that that that in diet for Jaundice slowly slowly dying Dil very popular in rural India and all that but you like mike I told my kids to another Universe fun show huge fan of I am in when I am I had the option to meet him once or twice and they couldn't get the references whose RajkumarDilip Kumar you know these things have changed to know and changing so I was born in 93 and in 2010 was about like 17 18 years old and your fresh and college in your looking for sheet to do other than just getting into alcohol for the first time in your life and nothing elsefirst people who end up going for comedy club shows at Canvas laugh Factory at first I think attended one of the way back but what was the thought of Monkey all when you look like when this was happening to what was the overall why when the Sands of community like what was the point of doing thatturn the passage of the collective the collective because it was rising sandoval rising by itself also but you know that time you felt you require some kind of a Leke collaboration in terms of Doing more work you know like Skechers like I remember when I was invited by Sourav 1 to 2 years his brief on the heavy weapon 2 more shows doing format shows doing shows the required for people looking at like-minded writers who write in the sameanything that I am be found you very funny we found you in the same zone as are so can you join a General like some coffee Shoppe mutton in Palladium is another way to measure is it bad to image heroine of this is why I will be doing some coffee shop somewhere that will be let's work together they do not plan was not thought honestly Kya Huaa but Idea was to like what is happening is that brands were coming to a separate a sketch for us that if it's either your Skechers dripreport like valentJay how is it celebrated and then Vishva big sketch of 8 minutes 10 minutes away every also several so what do you do which take the your and CO2 which events Holi happens in March let's have a sketch on Holi start start writing about it in Jain it should it in fact and but first week of March desperate out like a Holi Holi is celebrated in India in sketch about that and ok knowledge for Diwali sketch let's play store Christmas Catholic do a business catalyst to a gift of Rose Day and this catches so thatidea idea was to more writers on the board so more in a different input a creative Input and like for example I am in a given year is admitted and it's also say that if you have a many more women writers that time you know maybe are we would have gone and other directions also it was no waiting somebody had having once complete tour was at that time I think 3-4 years back was a zombie pubgall your Skechers a very in a misogynist a cover female centric and Tanmay try to be able to do the four guys Ashish me Rohan and letting you guys we don't think from maybe we need to get more female writers dishes which were not there at that time you're not getting into comedy space and show that that perspective also comes out you know we hired to female writers and towards the end when I left and your Skechers came out on Women's Day and getting thatis a very clearly hey guys you write the sketches we're just a little bit inputs that because he wanted to your voice to come out but what happened why did all of the required that culture stop that I think what happened is that term baby at that time it was the need of the Hour that you have collected is right you know but after some time but having a thing each of us individually started getting a lot of brand work and things I am a lot of coronavirusMI living as he was very personal because I came from 25 years of Corporate life you know I did this to follow my passion in a like I want to wake up at 10:30 11 on Monday morning you know go to organise coffee is it and write that there is a left all at it for an effort and 60s 70s started growing very fast and you doing very well so now we are seven of us we need a proper office we had no physician how many writers acid ok right place at the right as a Kanhaaccountant we need an Admin Gai we need a watchman outset you know Kaun Hai Kaun ja raha hai ok no you had six writers know we need to come on time and if we don't come on time they were not coming that they had to a target for Ram hey guys today we have to come out 6 means OK live today is March Holi is coming you me at six ideas on Holi each of you right and what less than what we were comedians we were traveling which also means that if your calling a writer saleyou have reached by 11 In all honesty in India anywhere in the world for kid India nobody work still everybody is there so which means when we started making rules that ok everybody each of us also has to come at 11 o'clock to the office which means I used to live in Jo which is in the officers and lower ParelAshok have to live at 9 o'clock from Juhu baccha lunch box go there will be there till 7 I did this for 6 years I've got to go back to back into that routine of an office and an Admin and timing and salary paying for all the other guys is good because a challenge in their young kid them not incorporated as I am coming off a corporate I don't want to get into this andbest friends Till till today and we said that I don't honestly I can't do this I want to follow my passion in getting too much in this getting starting a company again they left the company to this is my reason she is still there doing great work and there's still this exist and me and I think more also happened was like that my first video which are released into I said I'm coming 2012 the five years I started on my own so as to three years initialthree years ago the TSA 2017 nai release Mein that famous Justin Bieber video is the maximum comments I got that time was that people thought that was my first stand up comedy video in 4 years 5 years before that you like this only comedians what happens is that your amazing video this as a first video this is very good 2 and income business for your you know watch me before that was the things that I think is atime Aisa of broke out and in this and that you done well from there and everywhere she is growing and they are doing well switch good it's like rain Industries itself is growing so I think it was the need of the Hour that what is the best thing about it is that now you're on your own music pressure is on you there is no cracks there is no crush sorry that you know if I don't go far and distilled Lbs kechua to wake up and make the sketch yourself you want to make it ok to turn on the sun the newdid you did you plan out your business game in comedy also like how do Sana comics make money in the modern educational and the whole covid-19 make has create a massive weight on that industry and the third question along with this too is how do you manage money like now a days so once in terms of the Planning is there is definitely some kind of a plan just like any youtuber has anybody your brand of something into no not reallyin terms of awarding the brand like for example the slowly and steadily you know you are built on your brand value that the example here we were used to this is my ticket price around at the below that I am not going out on doing comedy today even for a corporate you have a minimum building value Beneath that value I will say no I will be doing nothing nothing really bad that that is actually an issue that it was sitting at home and scratching yourSamsung Vice City what is wrong with you just for 10000 rupees refuse that Cassidy as a point of to make because and that's how you build your value you know I mean you have to stop you can you will get a gift for in the AV karo that's what is a become a bigger than market get confused what is your value that one way soap in terms of plan you know I think yes that every problem to 3 months 6 months to release a nice video because unfortunately at one time recharge release a video on General ticket sales tono that is not have now these platforms that changed algorithms certificate in I don't really can't get what is selling what is not selling their for viral fever video become super viral you become you know people start coming 5A shows so yes there is a will plan thing ever committed follows that you write a new special every year you take around the world if you can and then hopefully on Netflix on Amazon will come in you know come to you and you negotiate in to show that special up that is one part of its second part of itwriter how are you are evolving consuming what are you consuming a commit in your deep digging deeper into yourself and trying to get the better jokes you know more about se personal jokes more you know insight in 5 jokes in a book that in the observational jobs you finished with it in a regular job to finish it is now you go deep down and see what you can you know that's one part of it places comedians make money offManish the ticket shows which you sell tickets for number do is to get private shows corporate shows that the big one leg corporate office is big for everybody informations any at form view that the biggest money make the paying for it private shows for you for it then legal writing opportunities as committed to our writers so lot of you know like I remember and every IPL of we should do this Filmfare Awards so you see Shahrukh Khan going on stage andShahrukh Khan and Saif Ali Khan going and cracking jokes on stage for 3 years at Filmfare Award office if they don't have time to sit and write jomso ways to go writers like just right for them and even some of the into till today live Bigg Boss in so many of these comedic episode written by writers comedians writers and people don't know that even that writing the page or lot a lot a lot to be honest it you they because this film writers have always been there in a peopletypes of films and movies and things like that and some of the budget there are not some crazy but it's ok they are good but good to sustain but not some crazy money but yes that opportunity is there and I would like TV right now get paid like 50 60 ke pure episode and all this may be for a big episode may be that and it could maybe with a team of 23 writers writinggood morning also maybe I'm thinking about Saas Bahu shows and writing and efficient today's world where does become so difficult because it's a you can say that you can't do this you can say this to in that environment drawing still trying to write create jokes writing then you get brandworks some of us were up comedians were extremely yours a popular or active on social media you get some brand Innovayou get I think these are the and supporting then if you wish for special comes out on Netflix now you get a good money from them so it's yes there is a good thing as long as you are dedicated to others as long as a working very hard and Odyssey touring I am working hard and I should do in my corporate level should a company with lot of people working and Amy and lot of more committed to that I am yours responsible for everybody salaries in the third of the money to pay salaries for 50 people that pressure is to be thesamanthakamani know that that person is not that but still there is working hard hard I would say because not your brand you know you are not selling a Cisco router with somebody else's why not showing Randy Orton to create a Somani multiple times of things happening and and so I think it up so in the panda because what happened is obviously you commit is like me Amit Tandon some of us Vipul and you know me animated to thithis first that the pandemic is going to be Harsh for us because live stage performances wouldn't happen so I like the dynamic lock down happen on 18th of March and by 2nd April had my first show on zoom zoom was never heard of it before installed it learnt it and answer of got into it I had my first on 2nd April that I had to show every week I had to do was actually a Friday 10 p.m. show50 people were not 200 people may not be as low As 400 people towards the end that quickly learnt that and then the corporate show started coming on zoom also at to be honest it u i mis U I thought on the pandemic it is we can we know we will die cut off at Rotary can't speak any longer and then all of a thought that I am going to be like 21 days 40 days maximal 20 76 days because who have had your itself in 46 days we lost our gallery 7621 481going on so did our shows on that we made money and observe what happened was that because of people were at home or a brand work started coming in in a more than last year and so because I was active on social touch should I got one of those deals also and I am telling you that things which have done this pandemic in the logged on which I would have never done in my novel I have made people pay housing and 42424 your head my pubertyhow to make people after every number that has to be joke anybody else on the spot inking written some Jo go to 13424 4 18 48 over the day I lost my virginity and have never done that in the and ready for love as it was against survival I haveI have a family to sustain I have a new sites but the likelihood of communism technique creative break I don't want to performance that's not the right platform maybe not the right thing and more than anything in the people were wanting the some kind of a in a release some kind of entertainment we fulfill that and I think I was happy that was one of the early adopters adaptors of this new virtual platform andbeen so bad you know what I'd envisaged to be known as the opening up and things are getting very soon you know bearing the worst part was dynamic is Vinay we initiate in baby June July we all thought how the nature has come back and dolphins are in Bombay sparrows and come back you can see Himalayas from Jalandhar in all that happen is better Yuvan beats going back we are going by instant in the first time I drew was driving after 4 monthsyou know and first auto rickshaw cut me and I am so you think you thinking that you knowit is in the pandemic left Bombay the ship to Goa ship to Goa because they say that mean of let me walk forward from already worked in a more beautiful player that no no I will not leave Bombay India I am too old rather than of commitments already here I love you know and what was said and done for a comfort of a comedian India's an amazing place to be had just in terms of the kind of content which we get enough we are such a rich and societieslanguages community is your Bollywood your politics you have cricket you have so many things you open the newspaper everyday you get for 4 hours of composite material just by reading the newspaper Singapore you got the prices are so flat you know nothing happening America still is used for things happening but this thing in India I will never leave India I love India is my country and and I thinkthe reasons one of the medians we were having a discuss their thing is it safe to do comedies in India any longer you know with is very right wing you say anything people I've been waiting to pounce on your every file to make the one mistake and we got the covid-19 dost Taxi No sew no yaar I still I am willing to take the risk and and as long you and what happened is unfortunately comedian the cells and sensing themselves you know andnews on India all countries around the world have their own do the problem I think other than America where you can get the night and give Gali to the president and next morning I like this but all country like I performed in Dubai you perform in Thailand you for every country has more or less things which you should not talk about you know you can say which you cannot say enough but you are so you do that when you go there is a similarly like here you modulus and it's not it's not about that like for example I don't know any religiousat on stage or ever you know and the reason is not because I don't have a possible for some reason personal reason I am a hindu I believe in Hinduism and think that unless there is a point to be made you don't sleep was already recommended don't get to know I hate let me your friends chalo kya hai Jagmohan Hindu chaloge machine for fun to think thatyou know you have a very strong nice open and can't find that we jokes you just don't send to this like I don't do political jokes on stage and where is the politics is a reserved for Twitter that the flavour of the day you know something happened to comment on it and its general comment like yesterday when I was coming there are so I've had been on Facebook not well yours truly like just yesterday I was reading on my Facebook back those Memories Back Then I should make jokeRahul Gandhi and Congress think like that there are not even living a life that time in their lives and now they go by using only against Modi vs Rahul where are you paid by congress in an absence of an opposition strong opposition it becomes responsibility ofeverybody say what is right what is wrong you know I'll tell you one thing like some time back and last emoji was sitting in Varanasi is kindness and he fell down ok and all this left hand making jokes on that nothing is so stupid old man fall in an environment jokes about it if your father good for tomorrow at Mr Stephanie fell down and I never very foolish when you sit and write jokes on that a make memes about that you know that your social dilemmas speaking through themnot really I think it's more of a kitten with its not having to make fun of you but if his policy on farmers is not good I am going to talk about it would feel if and one thing you should do is I don't go just because the tide is saying you know this actually an old person have read newspaper I don't believe on what the news channels are saying TVS a over Twitter async await for a post and next day read the newspaper do my own research before having comment if I would talk about farmers issuegoing on right now I should exactly know what it is before talking about in the form of a s u supported there they have a point black soft leather Delhi border but you have to have your own opinion about it I think that's very very important for people just step back and I just don't comment on anything just for the heck of it ok to eat anything for the heck of it step back in a listen read understand and then post about it what's the best way to get innews for a teenager today because you are exposed again to social media and you are exposed to TV channels both of which can be extremely polarizing I still feel newspaper to Thi newspapers again it's not same social dilemmas just don't read lines and have a Hindu have this and I spend one of my day everyday reading newspaper and everything I read because your stand up comic also I should go and do it always before I still doMLA ka admin old person so I have to have that the routine of mines years reading the newspaper Instagram the family visa with their in-house Vera joint family get three sets of newspapers one some reason the Hindu something The Times Of India established in the Hindustan Times and we all then again stopped and we all agreed that the same news obviously but so news channel TV News Channel has talked about it on social mediaTwitter account you can follow which gives you a fair think of what it is you're not feel free to name some just telling you it's not give your opinion in pages of example on YouTube the respective Genesis kam open YouTube and this again she calls experts on what happened today in these other news channels will be talking about farmer protest in the news panel

software you know we are not thinking where you are taking you will find the end of it you want what needs and which affected on a daily basis for some reason to solve that is completing a bad job so I am not get another job get another guy that as simple as that turns black to know that and I want more and more young people to get involved here we need to change our country I mean because you are

different mindset I don't know whether you know I need honesty more active participationfrom youngsters more into active politics but in some because if you change something on a national level you know you will have to you know you love to get yourself in the market to sort of change that you know and I don't know whether it be the political party is there all of them on the Crooks to be on the city of these barriers to entry barriers to entry is nepotism biggest a person is there and whether you're always there is a good guyfind the system pulls him down the system also makes and corrupt or the system will host of changes emoji find it gives up in an exaggeration is forget it yaar let me go back to what I was doing this is not my cup of tea and is buried within across the world Saloni India America you know any name any country Pakistan which country to talk about have in elections and it's the same across your hope it changes really hope it changes because he really require the change I actually think honestly I genuinely feel it will I wanttechnical Guruji Tech youtuber has established businesses outside of YouTube and most youtubers are either doing this for save money ok and even save it reaches a saturation point at some point after your doing your YouTube you don't wanted much after point as a youtuber why do you do this why do you do so many YouTube it is what do you enjoy like what you can order it and he said that somewhere like the ability to have influence know that another way of saying I mean people would callability to have influencing power gain power and influence of any one hundred thousand follow influences have someone to power in this world abhi and you have you knew there was a red t-shirt on Instagram and he doesn't use like it doesn't modern issues you might okthis study policy on lot and they themselves and get policy but we came out of the theory of the podcast which is that if in lekin 27 Lawson 13 years in 2033 abhi 40 years old so while many of the Other influences you also want to change up things if a lot and also keep my for 13 years will be doing social media will continuously accumulate people probably even more than at least the same level as cricket in Bollywood if not more than I thought it might be more just becausehow snowballing is happening in 2013 we will be the position where a lot of good social media influencers who have money to back what they want to do in get together and create a new political movement but they have in hot seducing the possibility hundred percent is very and I think the people are really looking at a change you know you of the fact is that I am again profile talk Mein politicsTamil Congress as a party just to say in its wiped out but still today in some states and their winning win the $1 elections in the last one year they won at in Rajasthan they wonder wonder what the status you wonder how they are so incompetent they don't worry leadership which also it tweet about it actually if there's a good chance that I think in 2019 when BJP won and the fact that in a BJP for example isquestion is political hai kya so is that because everyone and the amount of campaigning the use of gross this painting on if you done a great job you don't have to spend money people still wait for you and get into the unknown they came back to the thumping majority that it did that and it's very easy to know for startup political party you know to do a good job you know you have the right people and into a 24 your 5 years you can actually make a Dent you knowbut has to be Grass root level you know because Arijit Singh till now YouTube Twitter social media is just early in a miniscule of a population which is getting this and and also the people who controls the boats are from the interior of a country at 500 million of which are nodule on social media 100% and what happens if you were there in an over today why is fake news become so big its proper

it on the WhatsApp machinery which team effort goes into that that thing you can imagine that you say that that's already problem hopefully they start realising it but it's very big problem no after educated don't can't reason between I will not say every right to get it right and wrong they know that but I am saying that education really helps you knowanything and anion when you all for most politician is there are other keep their their water Bank uneducated you want to give them they want to put them in that they never you know never shut questioning but they may not be able to stop the Internet and hundred percent return of the Internet will get property getcontext for you know tomorrow fall usse dil se Ok Ban YouTube in India in a band this is a Dil given a listwhen Ranveer you know is going too much into politics in my Ban Jaega Guru Ban Atul Khatri band comedian seen it can very well happened it can happen you know another thing by anybody can see that nobody wants in a different as if you know you will do our staff we want to this is a Hyderabad Telangana Municipal Electionsputting in building a beach and in this section will take the Lok Sabha for the switch that kind of a you know machinery which your fighting against political parties are there in India for the last 70 years of fighting against was amazing if somebody can do it well done I think we deserve a good opposition which is good political party which is really looking for the Welfare of India without dividing people have these issueslooking at today ine today just brings one girl Muslim girl se to abort a child with Muslim couple is love Jihad thing which is started in UPA and NDA already married that children also but still they went and width of the husband the woman was put in some room and she is like miscarriage her child in all this unnecessary this is just you know it I would say propaganda which isand if I am not bring them we require Congress today also done some looted the country and gone away so it's everybody has a very good if you to the young youtubers in the young you know that I will be spending more time on science and technology in all these young kids are then in a setting like bucks and Ino and sitting and treating against a setting of Congress is just sitting in treating and again against read you know improve your knowledgewhat is the time in 2020 the time first child of the year was an Indian Gitanjali Rao the first time Child Of The Year 2020 was an Indian girl feel generally when you observe knowledge to get a wider perspective and mostly knowledge is spreading out in India body beginner nauvin Metro thank you talk to 18 year olds of the day the very different from your I was at the talk of courseyeah so that information gives you a wider even though there is a social dilemmas of polarization in this is one match of positive aspect of social media also where is giving a lot of information to observe information compare a 15 year old sitting in 1980 in some village in one corner of Madhya Pradesh vs that same village in Madhya Pradesh right now maybe there's no development in the village of those kids and the internetlions in Africa and know about what happened and What happens in Japan from their access this example Udaipur example where did Udaipur you are not change any references like during my time table setup kids of Bombay Delhi a much more smarter than the kids of a Nagpur for example is no longer the case since many years now internet is a level playing field everybody is consuming the same content will be the same WhatsAppFacebook and maybe the smallest is a more money spending money power than you and me in Bombay Delhi enough so that is that happened like long time back only baby so that no information spread or they also have the same Nike shoes in fact they can afford it much better than you because your spelling of the time and traveling party in this that you think twice before buying the expansion and their problems on the first day and it is there today like is there Nagpur is there in a mirror that there are everywhere just give example of MicrosoftI mean I went to Ludhiana many years back in 2013 for sure there and they said a Coimbatore analysing the Mercedes dealer yourselves momos season in Bombay what to do if nothing againstDada Patil Patil opportunity but this will this this information spreading out always create an opposition at someone if that is in need of the Hour Sen 2030 I really look forward to it and all the best series and I will see that there should be a wake up call to all why also you can study the case of Trump and how he got elected it was basic business and sales skills and communication skills but I actually feelAkira country dirilis sales skills less communication skills in business skills this country needs just a few Meri 45 really sharp Businessman to enter politics and change of everything you can be seen that by billionaires to Amin a guy like Sahara he definitely control order Manipuri also control order power at at his peak are not talking about eventually happen and he did that based on good sales skills he says you have to silence albinisman idea and Businessman don't enter politics because what you said that I don't get into that featured in I don't get my clothes dirty but I also think that can change that might be a good people come in politics is always welcome saying I do believe the people at the top even if they are good and I read this on a book by yuval Noah harari talks about the concept of power especially political powerfull reality get smoked where he will be bored of party with twenty one of the top businessman in the country of the top celebrities in country everyone was up to you because you are the one power not that's the 21 top celebrities in the country imagine what we will work with you are treating you like to work with you are treating you like you are a shit I will do anything for you should morphs no matter who you are and more of your own mind as well and they havedreams for India it all the layers under them that end up corrupting their mindset for corrupting the control the negative news political party top all the layers and but we because I mean that particular persons of a Sabbatical political party all the plane was a Rahul aur ModiPrince of Persia Sands of Time is it but is the the the the box around him the pin of those people who they are of That Power game so much does that even if the body is this committee is worked hard for it there is a political party from RSS and from yours it's not that he just Rose up one day and I am the king and I do appreciate that he is that she like it will do even even if it's miscalculated movie will try doing thatwhat I don't appreciate is obviously a lack of inclusion and all that happening in our country and this is all is a part of a bigger agenda in which may be the extreme right wing is forcing on him and then then then you're saving the shorter than you are to swim with them to the political podcastyou grow older what is the water sexiest body is not out of Shape completely but just drink and then black and also eats a lot of junk is startingerectile dysfunction type issues at 26 like just like how did this happen because and most of my other friends all really fit play football everything is working great but I also see your whole section of guys on the other front so one and sure when you get old you see a lot of your own friends with things like that but won't how does actually change for a gaigoing forward think first of all I talk to myself doing such change any bit at Hotel today I'm in I don't need issuesI am just saying that now adding guys we don't discuss biwi ligament I know my women friends let my wife's friends they talked a lot about the sexual ise among each other and the kitty parties in this that annoying because I am assuming I didn't understand what is sexual life In A 27 not married and is different but how do you talk about a sexual life in your 40s like I have had the value would be in a week in these old age to have this couple kittyall couples get together and what is to happen is a true story and I was a member at one time not stop this like this Prema comedy de do not stop this cutie parties but to be wise to attend this coupled with this is usually there in appearance of a of a children same schools and school couple kitty group 1011 neighborhood kidney or some friends you grew up with that said vessel cord when you meet once a month in summary our restaurant is just like a is a fixed in a look foreating some a nice place in a book restaurant will all go there and what is to happen is that isn't all the guys and one side all the women on one side we go to the guys at the f****** most boring side facing Modi aur Rahul Gandhi was talking about new BMW that cannot be what is the realise that he was front button BMW car and I never knew till then was that BMW doesn't give you or one of these German kam Alpha don't give your spare tire acid Why is it not the onlyI am mama Maruti owner at coronavirus you had that extra Stephanie in a decade ago because this new cars they don't they even if there is that there is a puncture it can still drive 400 kilometre so that you reach a place in repair things I didn't realise that you can do but I have to pay for extra in OLX Kurnool is boring talk happening that I want to come on the women side all the ladiesI am going to the ladies and material from them in all I want data every beating the mother in law that the teacher of the school or thing like that within the fun part of this but I am in toxicity definition charges you know you definitely me your libido does come down if we cancel way it has to be explained and but still I think it's a thing as long as your physically fit as it is a lot of thisfitness definitely available should I run the Mumbai Marathon for 13 years half marathon and use everyday practicing and of libido f****** goes to the roof and I should write about it and I like it like that you reach the finish line you just want to let it comepicture of its your help it is not enough old age group 52 and all this your these messages that you must joke of every day to keep your prostate so that you don't have prostate cancer when your world so you get all these messages that the message that changed it and I think there is also the guys as your age who are maybe not the peak level of happiness what is causing the lack ofmessages that not being in the correct job dies women volleyball men and women not not happy is not happy I am sure I am sure I think I'm not really expressed a new sense baby you guys of my generation we don't open up too much you know to each other Like Nobody Else coronavirus Hetu Tamizha weight loss to INRvery sceptical telling hey dude I'm having a financial problem you know you think and beyond is coming to me to ask for help but think about January hear what you see you lost their jobs like I no 2/3 of my friends who lost their jobs in this pandemic or was it will be an Happy Birthday never come to me and say hi to them and happy about it but I think what bothers people is that of the job security financial security you know I thinkthese are the main to issues which are there was really in about the people my age and rightfully a would be unhappy been separated I am 27 years now happily married and having some would have been unhappy that we had the differences get people to have an early marriages also but during our time in writing that the problem was a thing which is not then current generation ready comparing this is that there are things that too muchfamily from society to you know still sort of power through a bad marriage you know and so that look kya Kahenge or affect children not think referring now adding rightfully adding today right William saying that if you don't get on with a partner you know within 3-4 years 5 years in the river which if you had a child you can may be separate and Se Ke hi ok that's no way I'll take care of the child that separate or whatever you know you can have thatarrangement of an actual arrangement and other arrangements are there that in today's generation I think that acceptance is a bad way there was a growing up and you know it affect the child and things like that time I don't know what is right I think even going through a bad marriage and inner being unhappy for 26 27 years living in the partner with you don't like you don't sleep also the part number you just don't want to you know that you lost all the connection but still you to power thread because her parentsparents 11 you think it's too late in life

Big Bang Theory says that Big Bang happened around 13 billion years ago so that has been a lot of time for other planets and two other and other Galaxies to come at a stage where Earth is right now there are a lot of planets and a lot of planets are habitable as well in Fury so then where are the aliensRaviraj from Avenue hello hello how are you good bro I kind of a story a month ago and I think he does anyone here I want to talk about outer space and the oceans and new message me from Abhi and using that a I love the ocean Oceans and how we can talk about space so okwhere you got the idea was wondering can never say anything about what I think about the space what I think about space exploration all the science fiction stock anywhere I don't care I don't reveal my disposal hobby personal interests and if so how did this guy know about that and we just when is recording a great about the oceans with new so I gotta ask you man Lagane also science fiction and fanAbhinandan Cosmo have been to execute the regular hours interstellar has a huge impact on my life boats 12 shocking things you know about us page that it is blue people's Minds of the greatest thing that blows people's mind of is that the space itself is expanding explain what is a space what is the whole space expanding their so a actually speakwhat we imagine is the speed limit that is a global speed limit called the speed of light so what people imagine is that suppose in the future if we build a spaceship that is that can go at the speed of light theoretically speaking then in like a few hundred yards we will be able to reach this Galaxy that Galaxy but it is not true because a at a Galaxy level gravity is strong but when you go outsidesexy is there is something called as dark energy with which gets stronger so there is this constant tug of war that is happening advisable second Galaxy is a collection of stars in The Milky Way B1 Galaxy aur uske Bahar the something let me start on the very very base so our planet solar system like the eight planets that we have a couple of dwarf planets and the sun that's our solar system then a billions of sorry trillions of stars like thataur Galaxy our galaxy is milky way galaxy then there are a couple of galaxies around us one is Andromeda Galaxy and there are some smaller galaxies around us these are our local group you can consider that as Wadala that is our Wadala now suppose you have to go from Wadala to Dadar but you are Train speed can never match up to the speed at which the other is getting away from that is your space expandingin Wadala all of you are close friends all of you stay together where your gravity is stronger but when you go outside Wadala when there are even less and less things between two different galaxy is there is this empty space dark energy and dark matter that's where gravity fails and this dark energy just expands in itself rather is going away from Wadala at such a rate that even if you travel at the speed of light your train can never reach thatthe one thing that Blues me that no matter what level we reach we are never going to reach there unless we have a warm and going from one corner of the paper to the other corner of the paper it will have to travel the entire distance but imagine if we fold the4 in the middle then the and can instantly go from one corner to the other corner without having to travel the distance now we have we this is more or less accepted that the speed of light is the Global speed limit that nothing can go faster than light in the vacuum of space but what if we have that force of folding the paper of the fabric of the universe the space-time is the fabric of the universe that what wewe believe in so what if we can create one hole at one point and the other hole at other points and our specially for the women can just passed through Justin and Apple if your home has a hole on one side and other side it will not have to go from the surface it can just go through it taking a higher dimension for it the higher dimension is a third meant we can take a higher dimension than the three dimensions that we havewant to talk about touring one is in dark mode the network show darkness has become very popular that they confirm hall which is where the kind of go to another period of human history like another time period using the woman is the same logic what they have done they have conceptualize a wormhole that has a speaks location in space their location and time is different so that they have imagined the Wormhole that is sort of a time travellingwhat I'm talking about is a space travelling would like you can go from here to my home in a second highlighted a video idea I was working on sofa Hindi channel have been working on the series which I don't know will be released when it kind of luck part horror part science fiction based it called the Philadelphia experiment we hold of this so you probably have heard of thisI just want to recall it for you so you know this is that war is a time of technological advancement like as you have to figure out how to save your country how to make a country stronger so America had basically had hired Shukar Hyatt Einstein to develop Technologies which will help them become better at war so Einstein came up with a mathematical equation found the proof for mathematical equationthat I don't I don't remember what it was called I don't remember details of it but was something along the lines of most human beings think that only gravity and electromagnetism other two overarching forces overman over our existence on this planet but there are actually two more forces which people don't speak about and that is the force of time and the force of space which means that by gravity electromagnetism can be measured and changed the same thing applies to time and space and equation show the link between gravity electtime and space on the outcome of a using the equation used able to develop some kind of Technology am explaining an extremely the romanovs this is what Le man yah so using that equation he developed A device which he used in layman's terms to make object disappear they could make lekin Apple disappear they could make small object and the US government found out that you shared this technology is being discovered for example when they found out thatpower has been discovered dependent developed the atom bomb because that was the obvious other application of it that if such a huge amount of power Discover Let's create a bomb that blow up the whole city which will be like a very whatever it's a It's another application of the same Technology so Einstein was hesitant about this particular piece of Technology will he knew that it could have bad repercussions but no knew exactly what the repercussions could be the experiments on the technology had some success with paperhow to make some small of this view but at one point did something called the Philadelphia experiment way they had tried making an entire ship disappear or ship with people on a computer and the conspiracy of the Urban Legend says that the shoe factory disappear with all its people for about 10 seconds and it reappear them in the same spot but when it we appear there was a wide while it was disappearing and when it really does the green Mist that had formed around the ship when it reevery single crew member on the ship had ever gone mad had died or was found half attached to the metal inside the shape and screaming in pain and agony ok and the other part of the Urban Legend says that when these people were asked about that you know where did I go for 10 seconds The couldn't speak properly and some said that we just went to hell and came back so Einstein apparently send them to another dimension that he was hesitant about this wholeprocess because it opened up a wormhole 2 hell now the US government actually denied claims that this ever happened I think someone in the British Film Industry and making a movie on it there is a movie called The Philadelphia experiment and the US government had called of the director and producer and at theatre in the don't release movie and it was classified experiment and all that and they also had a lot of people come up over time people who perform agent to the US government some people who were on location where the Philadelphia experimentthis happening and a few of them again as you can guess they were found dead later so you know like this is one of your consideration that I don't know whether it happened or not it also shows the power of government in general the world tech how much power as a small group of people can have in order to even erase bits of history so this is another application of the verbal and science fiction in general so what doplan to do with the Philadelphia I think we were talking about wormhole and if it's the same the logic of momos comes out of a similar equation that we were the period of more than as a no in theory that there does exist ovum all we know in theory that a black hole is an opening to another dimension so now the actual name of a wormhole is a Einstein Rosen Bridgeactually a bridge between 2 points in space and its two points in time Darkness is completely later science fiction level does not go there but black holes now black holes are so mysterious that around the hundred years ago Einstein came up with the concept of Black Hole where all the rules fail but we did not have a proof that a black hole exists till last year it did not have a problack holes exist in last year last year on in April we got the first actual photo of a black hole and it's like a blurry photo or it just looks like if you keep your coffee mug somewhere and you get that small it looks like that so far away so we got the proof right now so now what is the link between a black hole and wormhole because we don't know what is inside a Black hole somethink that a what happens to all that matter that goes inside a Black hole some people just think that ok let's let's start from the very beginning ok how does a black hole form that starts from that so a stars formed because of gravity like there is this huge cloud imagine a huge cloud of dust that just comes together because of gravity and when it comes together because of gravity is majorly hydrogen that is using into Helium andelements are being formed there is a constant tug of war over there as well between the gravity that is pulling the star inside and the nuclear fusion that is happening outside that spews out all the energy what happens is this fusion keeps happening inside the start and one point after which star has iron and iron does not fuse with anything else so the star just gross have your and have your inside and there are two cases were one case is thatoutside for the nuclear fusion that is happening that overpowers gravity and thus are explodes in a supernova the private events and the star implodes into a black hole so now what is a black hole and what is the wire why do we call it black forcely so imagine a rocket that has to launch from Earth there is a certain speed at which has to go up that is called an escape velocity so ifthe escape velocity of any star any object exceeds the speed of light 16 escape velocity amount of velocity that an object need to escape The gravitational pull the rocket rocket has to go up and sideways really really fast how fast does it have to go to enter into Orbit to leave the leave the first rocket and doesn't Orbit it starts orbiting around the planet and then its slingshots from the planet itenergy emitted one point of time is that energy to go into another direction that's how Rockets go and other Rockets landing Chandrayaan also did not like this it was started revolving around moon and then it slowed down and then it's only land so escape velocity is that that the amount of speed amount of velocity that you need to escape a planet or a star at one point the escape velocity increases is morespeed of light when given light cannot escape it so that's what happens with light the lightest wrapped over there are getting the gravitational pull is so strong that even light candle light can and theoretically nothing can go faster than light if you go over there you can go faster than light so you will there is only one direction you can go to other direction so now if there is a black hole then possibly there is a vital some where is well like to sidethat's what people say that a moving black hole can be a vital to some other dimension probably another Universe as well but we are not of not observed that this is a science fiction if something that was here is a hundred years ago we got the first photo last year and probably this will take even longer to figure it out we have not observed in SOL theory if you really want to exercise your science fiction muscle interstellar is the movie I will recommend like butgreat to visualise everything I am in all these concepts the dimensions and everything it is explained really well in interstellar there is one more movie that I would recommend it's called contact it's my favourite science fiction movie which talks about aliens and everything our role as humanity and how humanity is measured and everything and I think it is written by Carl Sagan Carl Sagan was the guy who originally wrote Cosmos and then it was recreateright now by Neil degrasse Tyson Tyson really admire Carl Sagan said something nice which is a if you have to create an apple pie from scratch you have to create a universe because technically speaking all the elements that we use to create an apple pie come from an explosion of a star all the atoms so nobody can take credit for creating an apple pie from scratchmin Carl Sagan all the scientist the liar toucha toucha interesting point that science and philosophy just most together with very interesting to hear all these people brought an alien that has to be my next question brother what is your opinion on Aliens in general or around 4 billion years old and Big Bang Theory says that Dabang happened around 13 billion years agothat has been a lot of time for other planets into other in other Galaxies to come at a stage where Earth is right now there are a lot of planets and a lot of planets are habitable as well in future so then where are the aliens that is the essential question which brings in for me paradox so for me was the guy who asked this question if we had a lot of time and it isyou have life everywhere then where are the aliens so there are two possible explanations for this one is that we are the first we are the first is the most logical explanation or there have been many alien species before who are either not intelligent aliens in India like Dinosaurs their priorities are different there is majorly survival and getting at the top of the food chain and notother things exploration and cultural needs and everything that there are two possibilities of Aliens either we are the first and that's why there are no other aliens the space is not over crowded with other spacious and everything or there are aliens out there but they are just not smart and other priorities are different why would you want to go to Mars and try to colonize a try to make it like I was trying to grow potatoes over them in your priorities are differenttwo possibilities if Aliens exist but the thing is the Fermi paradox for you don't think there is more advanced species which are so advanced that them because even possibly be beyond our perception it's definitely possible scientifically speaking there are three skills ok advance in the sense what is your definition of advance the first scale is used for what purpose of skill soeone is when you are able to use all the resources of your planet so that's when you reach Type 1 we are not even type 10.7 level per so we are yet to utilise all the resources what water resources will be left solar energy we are not able to use all the Solar Energy we are not able to use all the wind energy we are not able to use that that reaches our planet is when you are able to use all the resources of your nearest star and your solar system so if youdebate use all the energy of the sun like all that energy the nuclear fusion that happening over the place to go to Jupiter use gases were there to create something you colonize every asteroid over there to mine something that's type 2 and type 3 is when you are able to use the energy of your entire Galaxy so a species that is able to do all of that like a species is able to use all the resources of its entire Galaxy that it will be a Godprepare for UPSC in the eye of a follower of marble in Silver Surfer and access to different different planets and use them eat that planet that would be like a type 3 Civilization explanation is that it doesn't exist or it iswhat is not ready for it I mean it is not even a snack for it don't want to interact with a strongly that from yoga weather talk about higher being being outside of human perception for example and there's no easy way to explain this but the closest metaphor would be Anant Anant only travels in straight lines with whole life is an x-axis and y-axis two-dimensionalIndians can travel in front we can walk side and we can jump and alien 3D correct but there is actually of 44 d a v d and these being exist in 4D and 5D which also brings me back to interstellar like the end of it he enters the black panther active until the tesseract where he is able to actually move across time as well he's able to cross time as base timeline is very easy to imagine for our editsbasically if you're at it then you can definitely add a certain image over here has happened in the past but you can add an image over there because you are Sourav traveling in the fourth dimension that is the fourth dimension is time that just the way you are able to walk head sideways and up here at ekli you can just take one step and you will be one your younger that is your birthdayyou are able to use time as a physical dimension time is a temporal dimension and Logistic in One Direction you are a Prisoner of time resort near degrasse Tyson calls it a Prisoner of the world of about going beyond being able to travel through time as well but that after you reach a certain level ofdefinitely see of basically again moving from Science to philosophy a lot of people believe that whatever happens I mean I'll give you an example that will be better for you to understand I always have that has this conception in my head that I have this cousin who is really rich who has a really beautiful house and I had not visited his house for around 5-6 years and I went to his house was a couple of years ago and they observe ki Achcha house lekin itna bhi achcha Nahin Haimemory was sort of manipulating me into believing that his house is superior to everything else that I have since I was menu plating my past as well by manipulating your memories you might be able to manipulate your experience of the past probably that is what Yogi is that is what you these might be in your able to manipulate your experience of the present also by manipulating the experience of the past because we are comparing right here we are comparingyou are comparing our past their comparing our present and future heroes the issue with people who are absolute men of Sciences 1 Oz is nothing wrong with that your number back person I am number black person with my profession and like this nothing wrong number back and Science back but what I don't enjoy is where people will switch off the entire Faculty of perceiving things when it goes beyond a certain point of departure for example this concept you just spoke about that through whichpatient by the way you are able to visualise of past moment something that gone wrong in your past and relive that scenario again and again and again till when you come back in your meditation in the present in urine ok that's what went wrong cool now made peace with that now the concept of yoga talks about the stronger visualisation gets the stronger your belief in that a process gets the better the effects of that process actually going to the past changing things and coming back when he went reaches aAstral body actually allowed to travel through time change things and come back which is also what I felt in my experience like I had never felt like I was short but over time travelling listening to this most of them will be there will always be a group of people will be Laga Kuchh Bhi bolata Hai like this is like but when you reach the point of Kuchh Bhi bolata Hai just keep in mind that true knowledge is knowing you know nothing and even human beings and Sciencelong way to go like we have too much to discover of course of course there is this theory as well which is called as the knowledge and confidence ko write a lesson that you can put it over your email to notice when your knowledge is close to nothing you are really confident because you don't even know what is there to know then slowly you start gaining knowledge and your confidence just because you are overwhelmed with there is so much to know aboutdangerous like this Nike shoes as your knowledge increases your confidence increases but you start getting so humble that you never reach that overconfident stupid face that because there is always more to know about I mean imagine like a Sokal imagine a circle and your diameter is your knowledge but the circumference will always be greater than your diameter so the circumference of what you do not knowalways be greater than the diameter no matter how much you are diameter increasing and also into making in general what has some time travel moviesyou have to an every person has to watch Back to the Future because it's such a brilliant movie it's not overly technical it's have you watched it for the people so basically from 1980 is goes back in time in 1950 and his mother falls in love with him before she met before she meets his fatherso then there is this problem that his mother is in love with him and not not with his father so he can be bought that sort of time travel dilemma is a so beautiful if she actually doesn't fall far is that he will cease to exist where you are whatever is happening in your future is also affecting your past Soya other all of these are theories of there is one theory calledGrandfather Paradox as well with said that if you go back in time and if you kill your grandfather before your father is born then who killed your grandfather of Grandfather Paradox of realistic contact the one I spoke about then there is this movie called arrival which is not a cup of tea for everybodyfor film buffs it's a very interesting film because it tries to solve a basic problem of communication in an alien being we just assume that rocking I mean really is how we communicate verbally is how we communicate but what if the alien species that Land Rover your does not like to communicate verbally for example dogs sniff really well sense of smell is really higher than ourwe can't even imagine that will be adding a colorblind of the sea in black and white something so for us visual staff is really important Veer give really we emphasize a lot on Colours but if dogs were in charge of this planet would not emphasize on Colours in the sense of smell that is the stuff that it tries to address that how we would communicate First they establish what is yes what is notechnical answer very interesting movie as well but not everybody is cup of tea and observation that a lot of people dislike science fiction as a concept to decide science fiction movies are often also arrogant that I feel like you need a certain level of humility to even perceive this reality I had a lot of people say that I hate science fiction books to for what we should doesn't exist and again they have overcome that you are talking about and their confidence of the way to hack computer knowledgeS2 movies aliens write up Star Wars but then it's it's more of a small AC phantasy Star Trek actually as a series it has a lot of Concept like actually this home will this concept it somewhat stemmed from Star was a girl Star Trek Star Trektop of my life in the seller is good but at certain levels in our field Me Alive the whole love explanation like love trans and leasing and wasn't I was not able to digest that but interstellar is really good movie in a lot of respect my red crucible actually went into the deep mathematics of things to explain it visually on skin the casotec Agar Kya Hoga gift for as one of the scientist who actually worked on thatgive an actual scientist who saw of imagine that yes black hole would look like this and another as we have a picture it is somewhat close to the great achievement at the end of this episode I just want to thank you abhi while I would have loved to speak even more about aliens may be that for an hour episode and is there any other sining of notes that you like to give your content here to read a lot so this in turnscientific knowledge in terms of what you know what space what would you like to tell people watched videos on YouTube watch V sauce although he does not make a lot of videos anymore but then I have learnt a lot from we source and there are lots of Science related video creators video makers out there and of course do not 10 on science fiction because a lot of stuff that we see right now that is turning into realityfor example the photo that we have a black hole it is very close to the imagination of all these mathematician and theoretical physicists so do not disturb on them just consider it as a possibility because ultimately is about accepting what we don't thank you brother feeling all of these and is down below make sure you go follow me sugar subscribe and relax I will come back with a beautiful topic from the realms of science fiction again thank you brotherI will come back with a beautiful topic navy from the realms of science fiction again thank you so much

means your short video platforms of the world by the district of and several other similar app people are not tynamo in that is to be a camera strike country is used to have been behind closed doors in the past two Mirrors right now it's very different in India to the concert is turning on the cameras and dance into a dominating to it and putting it outI Think Social Media is giving people social gratification you are able to build a personal online that may not be your real life on earthcontent is totally evolving towards democratization so while the highly produce big budget shows that we make and other people make that the big but it shows that be made and other small budget of the produce content it will of course be made but more and more you will receive volume of consumption happening on user generated content just because there is its limitless does not limittry we got the co founder of pocket aces Aditi Shrivastava men thank you for being on the Ranveer showyeah the whole you know it is the team that I looked up to allot right from Black Day 14 November black when I found out what they were doing in the content specific order that they were approaching things very entrepreneur really I always felt that that is what should be done in the end in YouTube space so while I do wish to know the entire story I want to kind of dial baccha bakriPound rate with two other people one of which happens to be your husband but even even before that I know you guys don't have a background in media or content so where did this story startstay up late at night to Sun TV padam movies Aditya antenna Lagake and we should stay up all night like watching wrote and movies and never had the best time except huge fan of movies and a huge fan of TV serials and show that gives all in all it was doing engineering and my to co-founders Ashwin Anirudha in collegeand Audit took some like film making classes on an appreciation of cinema type of class 5th in colleges velvet revolver 50 to lower the pressure of the rest of the engineering classes that you have and then when we all have to New York to start working on a course in the New York film academy direction course there and she was volunteering to set up incompatible the having the New York every year started and I got married and moved to India my more in development and social development so very different and he wanted to pursue them so that when he joined Reliance entertainment after that some pictures and that's when after you know that he was in the business it was ok now I know enough I developed enough the network to set up somethingand goal was always to create content for the youth of the country and that's how the idea of pocket aces came out and then you know that ok mode I came on board and give that how to show the way this is grown would you say that filtercopy still like the main baby or because I know I'll do a bunch of different things as locothere are if the rumours are to be believed there is like full-fledged films in the pipeline and all these things are also happening so I mean how do you look at it and how did you are located at the start because even when someone trying the start of content based company on Youtube No 22 23 year old no teenager will think as wide as you why is it feel like there was definitely that element of your professional life prior to joining the world of content that camebut you are at that point was starting at what was going on in your headsyou know it's a project so you have to be you know already time of known in the space for the ability to handle future without my secondly there are many important parts that are aligned together rights over whether it's the you know whether it's the artist you know the director of the writers the actual card not detected the easier to get to write the car is actually the heart Institutebig name then that the Studios rides are then human for the distributed as to what we realise that little becomes remains in your control because it's too expensive to be a visa finance anything yourself and we became just like the people running between all these parties trying to put together a project and we definitely spelt in a lot of people in the media business spend your timemovie mein for all that time was very important and we definitely didn't want so much time to go by without something tangible to show for it right as an output so that I thought that this summer business model is not suting as because you know even after make a first end in itself get rid itself into one year to make a second and even know if it doesn't do well then it takes like to your ideas to make a secondlook like something which would work there are you know every single day would feel so excited to be in this as it was it was that it started now the type of content is very cheerful that you know we have been because of growing up outside India and spending some time in the US as we have grown up of exposed to all the bright good International continents that the use of India deserves this quality content made specifically for themUniversal acceptor the type of content with clear movies to digital and why it is difficult because again the realisation dawned upon as that everybody is like watching on their phones actually 70% off on throughout the day not just on Friday night the non stop we can try it happen during commute to wake up on the pathon the Vibhag phone rights go to bank format can be so different from the movie about short the cost becomes very easy jobs and then as soon as the money is in your hands the control water in your hand and so you can make as much content as you want you can distributed and you can if it doesn't work that's fine next weekthe training of a previous rose in finance the way that came into use was because with that after the realisation of digital dawned upon as we researched the heck out of what was happening in other parts of the world in the spaces while and at that time it was something that was going really really fast and a lot of our citizens have been from thatabout how short video channel how to use Facebook and YouTube the time of to grow organic distribution you don't have to buy used how to increase engagement so we learnt a lot of our lessons using Research and trial and error and experimentation of unit 10 of the content that you were putting out a systematic approach once we decided to go digital and I think that's very good differentmodel of people do in search and if it's possible that it doesn't work try this Facebook ke liye at Alwar the share button for the important YouTube search what important issue in the initial days they actually side is much more towards Facebook because it's nobody knows you how is the search for content writer on Facebook if you popup on people timelines and shareso it's much less visible its content this company and that is very lucky because I just launching adjust on Facebook with you in India and we became the first creators to go beyond just because we indexed more on it and that partnership who held them very very good start now we have 7 Ramstudent visa copy content Grounds which includes an animation channels Rambo includes are infotainment channel nutshell it had a talent management arm cloud between recently announced filtercopy remains the bad Dragon butter and the largest Market in tableau how will not so people think the name of our company was the filter copy right now is the lightMartin can be used to promote and which counts as the early days of the steam 2014 was not totraditional and 9 September 2015 Vada first video release cal Bandhan on the reaction of the copyStorms now as well but ok I won't actually I have so many questions because I was a very long description and enjoyed it so I have too many questions from especially the early part of this whole journey on a personal level what was going on in your life that we all had to rush so much and the second question I have is via the three co founders and not too or not for like wanted 3 of your bring to the table individuallyshop everything goes back to our bringing actually many ways for these two persons show all tables and when other than myself a born to be rebuilt like service-oriented families we actually are the first entrepreneurs in India no entrepreneurs before that might have been to the engineers and daughter Family School of doctorswhich is the which is the different one so reason why we felt that time was of the essence was because you know we had was three jobs before moving to India flight arriving at Goldman Sachs group and ungroup was working at Bank of America and after that was the dream come true for the firstIndia in the Middle East and drop in Kuwait so that I needed so I am 2nd standard by the way and by and the other being college women are asking in the US working in high paying Finance jobs was either a dream come to write all the then wanted is the people buy apartment in Manhattan have children and live happily Ever After thatso when I moved to India and when I first moved to India element of family not at all in fact I remember my dad be likeeducation and because of which we got a good job but because of that it also take risk and if this doesn't work out the can always go back Soviet promised them that is this doesn't work out within 2 to 3 years we will you not thinking something different than never go back that's why time is of the absence because we need to also proved too Artist and to them thatsomething that we can do about it if we want you will do it great that you know you want to do something different and it was a long time it was we were already in India for about five years before our first video releaseso what you are doing them and then that interaction model with their periods and I was working in social development so I was touring the entire country going to village is working with no income community is very different from what I did before that or after that but honestly there was some of the most fulfilling kind of work which I did that for about a year and a halfand that's when they were able to be with you know what we now realise is what matters most is the stain power light you keep trying something if it doesn't want to try something else something else but you are so passionate about the call that you don't want to me and that's why it was important now the time now I realise so I thinkis lonely join right and honestly I think it's great to have you have the exact same problem here you can be so on to them you can learn from them and crimes of the cause and so when Ashwin initially was in a row in the movieit started the bunch of things in college together including like a cricket team of like thatand thus when the kind of like you like he was going to do this with us and 50 and so I was told him but he is a jointdigital requires a lot more people and move your own right butin terms of our tangibles is a very similar background engineering and Finance but I think are you like non tangible skills that are very different so where I come from in that are hard because I work in in India in social development and I would actually taking high net worth individuals money and targeting in towards social work so I have theIndia mein series kaise hota hai the content and down and you have the marketing part that I started looking at looking at on the Internet and over the period of the last 45 years you know it's broadly dinning this but also overlapped in the areait is also look at Loco now platform to get this thing on paperhard skills which are different and the soft skills assemblages were seen across businesses and respect to the numberoptional in securities with complete knowing the fact that these people treat you ever right and be able to be really good friend inside and outside I think that is the most valuable part of of having or co-founder the software that is the most valuable and because you are interesting equation and you can I know each other independentindependently and as soon I am going to be have a dependent equation has been really helpful I think it's because each pair of equation so you are actually very under the nightside both together sometimes it's not always the action is actually so beautiful soon the third person then it is because then you can take size effect but it's very very balanced it's so I'll ask you about how youwhy you guys is money how are you thought of scaling up which is also something I feel that most of the Convent woodfield to do like most people feel the process of scaling and Kiran like one channel 1 distribution line not multiple things get to all that leader but first I wanna ask your marriage like how is this like affected / not affected your personal relationship with your husband because a lot of people you know even so dating someone from the same industry of Hotelpeople say that this is an overall I will get monotonous I can't imagine what mean maybe maybe you know at the stage of life you guys are it easier but I am really curious to know how marriage comes in to play when when you also a co-founder with your spousethere are definite pros and cons again the pros are the trust factor the fact that us a line you know in many ways to each other you understand each other and entrepreneurship is it just right and a long periods of time where you are scared or you are upset or you are worried and we understand that so Roly Poly together becauseinciting that is being the strongest part of it the cones are definitely there so the fact that animals also got to better with over time the kaun sa you come home you know is a look back at home or not you are talking about workyou the unit that sometimes you really like how people outside birth but at what is very different human and with that in both its difficult and the third thing is you know thatreflective personal relationship and if you have fight phone does it show in yourself right and so it's not easy so for all husband wife teams are out there even if it's not easy and they have to put in the extra effort or so you know when you are fine reading when you doing this style of things when you people have these questions is well right especially for just couple entrepreneurshow have we kind of change over time in film and development to come homeis always socialize with my college of the importance of these words any storyis on one side of it so that each of us that we will not work right which means as this will give your face when you are in the car was talking about was at home is the nature of work we will let you done thisbecause you just never and again things became a lot more you not for the clear and tap at home is well I think it's a fine balance it's not easy but it's a joy like spending all day with each other as well as providing the hours work You See Me 2 hours a daywe are looking at each other on a daily basis but to take out and and the people that sound box so so do you think that like going forward you will see like it is itto see more couple entrepreneur live in the world because you don't see this very often so my hunch is that even you guys are at a much more mature stage of life to be able to handle this into take that call off like I don't I don't talk to you about work at home But or is it actually just very unique to you guysyou know there are two types of business is a broadly write one is this growth venture fund a kind the business Right By The Other are for example Lifestyle diseases where is live score and study that business you are actually taking out money expanding our road Lifestyle PG get paid salary the profits of the business in the business we get there but the lifestylewhere is like you said that Apple is the founder and in the few other employees that finds that their house was ok for my businessit's not you need to add any couple can make it both their existence has to be aligned and they have to be on the same page on some husband look I can work long hours and he doesn't get so that and and similarly live Aisa Bata but I feel like a lot of women don't have that can support system write something personal as well as for example we decided that he has killedso the pressures from the families are quite faryou can also was still have like a full-blown right side of so in healthy and it cannot find that specialthe modern is a mediator anything also is one of the ways in which we met had individual conversations with you both its not work narrative that much but especially you too I know I know well now I feel like at least I have a gauge of who you are as people so I get why it works both extremely kam mature and at the same time really fast thinkers so and I think that whole engineering factor also aware that engineering dost you generally likego to the grind 218 222 and coal mines and kind of switches are for the receiver love you see everything is patterns and Solutions so something non engineers fail to understand the experience of a big factor in travelling through this new filter copy path easilyanything but at least invisible Liberal Arts school so while which means that I will taking dance and this is also theory and practical I was taking philosophy sociology this that so I think that education is really opened my thinking out and I think the key thing that nightauto Kuwait from my college was that I can do anything 11 so anything that I put my mind to acchi of cores with a lot of hard work at this except on the and get the analytical thinking that engineering teaches you right that you have this thing which is broken how do you fix that there is a solution that and baseson Europe that is get no problem that is impossible you can figure it out and you break every question to its basic right which is like to first principle and write a signal of the answer from that so I think that because outsiders in this business even when we came to digital agency that are out at source code u p Patola so go talk to the agewhen you went to talk to the agency the all actors who are you by ok ok but and the outsideorder not at all which is a very strong and Ecosystem that the problem that because the research on Facebook and I was a huge advantage because I have no so I think that engineeringthe exposure to the finance the being able to speak the language of the CM on sea summary spending money with me I am able to speak the language of how the by this work how are you want to see return on investment of the money definitely so that really helps as well euro to convert that business so from various point to give lighting engineering and breaking down the problems question everything not taking anything from jooblecan help finding a transmission and Finance has helped interest being confident enough that you can understand people perspective and convince them that you know that you can deliver value to understand looking at what stage do you guys think of raising money and why did that question arises because all wanted you had a good vision of y'all word been 56I'm asking you this like generally the content world doesn't want to play around the financial world too much of the content would generally is mostly a bunch of kids can do creating their own videos creating their own content and I don't want that added tension of having investor backing having to answer your older people about their profits over Bureau their performance in the year soshort the day finance background had a role to play the but on a deeper level as a contest was what you guys think that there has also division for I want to be here in 2020 that we need to raise money right now on what was going oncreator of which love like you are in so many others are you know in ecosystem also a fantastic but for us were less talented folks who are not like funny inherently or can't atwal in heaven for us automatically to look at it as how can we add value when will you come from the management front right and the business branchautomatic creator right we have built on you know a creature creator company and many creative brand and the most important in the numbers are all created but individually they are not that so far as it was how can I set up business that can actually createfor the youth of India anything that I spend time on the world I wanted to be to leave a Legacy and right which means that after I go it should be there and put that again you can't rely on individuals as you have to be the company for that which can functionequally well as coming in our content in the face of our own content that's not to go it's not to invisible in a car has really well known or really Bade to the public would be nice but our goal is to set up things which last way beyond so when you think about it that way automaticallyalways building it right away and I think about ok you want to entertain the youth you want to solve their bottom which is the mission of our company you can see all the right because there is so much with so many different interest that they have you also like sportsthat is how we are looking so by definition you have to build it like to add one on top of the Other so when you think about that we automatically you know you are building muscle change your working with people and so that you need so if you have personal capital that if you come from if you come from well then you can put on capital and honestly the great to be your own Bossis Greater not answer to anyone but I don't think being able to answer to external parties brings the search is discipline and government write a discipline it never understand by governments which how you how clean is what you do in it what you allow other people to do the cultural fit that is basicallyyou know what any other factors come under a good very governed company and that is when a third person instead of keeping an eye on you I think you do that really well so the foundations that is very very strong imagine you have to stick school so officer role of foundation is strong and you can build on and you many thingsalso I think it's time to change the status of Indian media also in a very so the application is that right tomorrow why can't be talked about the same breath as one of these really large media conglomerates by the Disney order for Sony or somebody else we want to be talked to be in the same breath you want to be large view at Global aspirationIndian stories outside India so I think what do you want to build the way that of house built and Faraz liquid diet Kuchh Bada banaenge Jo Hamare Bhag ki chalega that was wrong and asking you this just because you areperiods with Wall Street as well as this content media entrepreneurship world is it fair to say that a lot of content companies or media companies don't scale because of a lack of culture and because of a lack of Europe that just growth mindset that what I see like Italy surround me with people my people don't care about things like a company culture that I saw on your filtercopy web site I am sorry on the pocketaces website you guyshad one entire section about just culture of this is our culture this is why you should join us at our so fantastic like I'm dead so that when someone in the same ideas but in a more practical than people acting out the culture definitely a black Apple culture was one question that does not leave role in scaling of right and field does from where I stand and the second is this lack of growth my travel to moneypeople play extremely safe games award and the isn't enough risk taking ability I might be wrong but that's just what observed every year we settledlarger than the Earth if there was the growth mindset was there are 5 people take it as a given the I cannot compete with these large program but you can I know why can you because you have some advantages that those don't say you are much closer to the actor audience in the age behaviour patterns you understand the audience much much betterbe you are much more nimble you can take decision to me and implemented tomorrow you think they asked what you can change this while right it doesn't take you paper question of many many months together using instruments they have grown on the back of cable television not a single large incumbent Media company today has really figured out social distribution on digital they are now on the platform but nobody haswhich is social institution we all have a huge advantage back to their teaching 50 million people weekly who can claim that so because we are growing at the back of his dance also I think people always look at the advantages that the large companies and feel arey mere pass mere pass but they forget about itso I think that yes there is definitely a mine site where you have decided and I do in to challenge you know many more income winds and I mean look at the large trailer on YouTube today weather AccuWeather Ashish chanchlani or Prajakta Koli oncontact by your own management companies are you doing humongously well there is no reason why you want to even more right with with what you are already doing so I think that that mindset is anything it also depends on the training so who is that you tell you that the right person to play a role where we can helpfigure out how to scale in India day on 1 or 2 Chapter what is something that would be really nice and others as well because for others also started to think about Newtoninnovation is a part of the culture method is Daily Delivery part of the culturewhich means you want to take more attention minutes which means have to launch more things people have more interest when was watching one type of content by the Physics theories of wages is not with you over the differenceChandi Si I think number one you have to listen to what the people in our team has to say I am 36 I am getting from the audience the core organs which is younger than any you person who joined by Navneet Le correct about which new platform will nowno hierarchy when it comes to debates and decision making and everybody was asked to be intellectually examples and neverone thing another company visiting is the biggest downfall to scale is the who the hell are you of Notre senior junior but who is more important sabse Wharton actors Uske bad director Uske bad writer uski Baat Na uski Baat not the case at all especially in this and it also whether you are the biggest stateaur Aaye finance die in a finance team if you guys are the same level of the nation with existing you were treated the same way there is no Heights I am am fanboy entangling in a company at all this is a huge factor for success of thinkers who can come up the curve without ceiling care I am not one of the more important people in this company everybody ismany many companies that have these this culture andregular people can learn from the skill and become good manager when you have good managers goes managers can manage new channel take and growth they can think about new ideas and they can provide power for creators is well so this is why culture and innovation is so important so I'll give an example was recently set up something called the audience insights committee which felt that as we were growing and the company 255 thatwe're talking to our audiences directly answering the common sense that Banta with views to do much more when you are smaller than the committee which were actually picking up the phone and talking to audiences directly and their the team of 8 people is Special Task Force type of diabetes and so the valid as the application protocol was very excited to do it in addition to the regular work andit ok to now until the people directly on the phone and the quality of different leather what are the spending at that time would be like not like and ask questions about an accountant asking about their lives in his life in general and that feeds into what movie did what new channels will launch which new platform will launch coil winding is very importantimportant to keep doing his Newton write and read realigning your Mission 2 euro to the Priya science or server which is the only ones they are happy everybody will come come to us because he has worked with so many young people also and I know I know that because I don't know whether to that the conference at one ofpanels been on budget mentioned how acting Ashwin actually someone had asked him how do you keep content relevant and is at the solution is to keep hiring younger and younger Talent by that in every year this will be new 22 year old will be even closer to your target on that so that the actual ki but I'm sure that sixes in you've also see the pattern of how 22 year old evolving from where you stand and also again in the field of content you get out ofview of things you understand how audiences minds are changing so what would you say about the youngsters of today like the 22 year old 21 years of today and what would you say about how content is evolving in the YouTube / social media gameI think the answers of today as the think about their purpose in life much earlier than you know we used to think about our purpose in life so I think when they arise in their first job they already know what they are passionate about they already know what they want to do not do in life than that it might reflect changes might not be so formula is that they have a muchI am I think they also are much more close to deleted from people so I think good and bad so the goods of this are you get into the locker facility opinion who will not in even a second to your are there something that you and I don't agree with you which is a good dayI think did you get bored very quickly they do get impatient 10 is 1 then is the culture of wanting Quikr gratification so hard so there is a so I think that the way to workand in perfect harmony with every batch of 22 year old is that you always visible and you train that you also you also have to change your mind to what is now ok in the dress what time do you know what I do you know how many like you also have to as a companyright and decide that was ok but not ok with you and training part is very important why you are so happy that look these ten things according to the company would be patient you will get to see the good thing about sector is and joinshowing them that their voice matter their opinion is taken into account and you will get tired and captured your on your you have to make sure you keep the linkage which also kept it to elevated I don't want to lose my back my touch of 22 heroes have to give them something interesting to do next year by definition and so I think I would say these are theand definitely you do you also need your managers to be ok with this because when you find a lot of people complaining about right part of the future so the Fallprice audiences and actuators a what what is what is UGC Orion like it PT explain it for the listenersmimicry is used to have been behind closed doors in the past to measure right now it's very different in the concert is not turning on the cameras and dance into a dominating to it and putting it out the words t i think social media is giving people social gratification you are able to build a personal online that may not be your real life on earthlive your dream time of a nice write I want to become famous easier to the coupling is now at least in your life that look ecosystem it is easier to showcase your talent is easier to make money doing that so I think content is totally evolve into words democratization so while the higher heat reduce big budget shows that we make and other people make that the big but it shows that we may need andsmall budget Tok video the produce content but more and more you will receive volume of consumption at any one user generated content just because there is its limits their right to use so I think that is one big evolution as well as the other thing that is it will come but showingimportant virtual reality and Augmented reality and stuff like that I know these words are like very over us but you know if I can you show where I can replace the actress face with my own that would give me a lot of a watch right and so that can start real what parties that that is not working right now that it's together we want to watch something remotely it's very very meSchool remote working around the world you can watch with anyone friends and family from that will evolve in its all about the people write three more than anything but the people who play well and can you want to show that so I took a number 1 content and its uses tablet content will pocketaces behan 10 years while I know that I am 100% sureforehead with your play that Lego Lego Blocks game only think of your next step but wash your hands right now it is true that question at you what would you like to see in like 2030 in Indiahow people are consuming how they were creating so I would just like I think we would like to see what basis amongst the large Ninja Punjab globally having a hero created a path for creators to start from scratch and created at the content and then create your love story movies of whatever that definitely for creators and their parts that is something very very Cognizant officecreators No one needs right cause you want them to also you want to give them also better and better opportunity and for the audience is well and we like to be one of those people who keep audiences are spending a lot of times in human population and all related content to solve important and creating the national Dent in the content ecosystem Global visachange gears up completely and make it about me or people like myself I mean like zero because you guys are scaled up conduent company so much the obvious game that individual creators need to be playing is the game of scale the ecuadorian the podcast we said that you know why not have more channels than that on AC even even the individual creators life has a lot of cons Dadaabout enough on the Internet or not on the head of the mental health issues but I think one massive Kaun is time because we're supposed to give a face and a physical body so much to the camera like this so many business ideas I have which I know for sure shot success because I have understood business by this point of my life and I really wanna execute on those but it's just not I don't have the time for it and and add problem not found my I have an amazing highest but have not found that wereteam member at one go found who help me create what I wish to create an incredible job that thing even more ideas and because your Accord interior fit out so much content you get again you get a bird's eye view of what the audience needs to you know what is able to build neck but because I'm giving 80% my time to send camera work it doesn't give you much time for thinking about raising money thinking about a scaling at thatVitamin C trying to fix over the next one or two years and bringing people might in full do exactly that would be xerox copy of myself to be able to scale of things even better but the question is like how do you see this individual create a ecosystem because if you know the west is to be followed which is usually what happens in India like what happens in America Europe and the happening in India traditionally I hope it ends atyeah I mean I hope that that changed because even stronger but do you think I mean we see a lot of Western creators fading away over time people either get bored they are done with after a point in a ton of money and they could I don't want any of that that stuff that brutality and more when we go for this International forums you hear a lot of international create a say things like I talk to your break mm and method for it does get mentally taxing for one person especially for all the statesdependent on US like one individual human meditation helps a lot deal with all that but as people go through a lot of shit because of that individual pressure so my question is what your whole viewpoint on the whole individual creative life and what their best case scenario like where will the top creators behan 10-15 yearsI don't understand I can't seem to understand you know very well but what I can do what I will share is at my dear select two ways in which you can do the kind of scale was that you want to do right one way is another advantage of our creator rights of movie show time at which the panelused to being the face how do you use that is what you have to figure out if so what you are currently doing in that and that but you have more entrepreneurial and I think it's actually not very hard to find onfor those ideas and find them along with the idea itself right for example say you put your Idea you know the other is was discussing on the idea that you have right SOS paper right and then use you figure out because you have the experience how much is received money will it take to get this of a chance to find somebody to do that for you right in thatyou also new to it even with your contacts that person doesn't you to witness to the length of its solution if we have the ability of anything and everything will be required and you are you are you are not on it and you also part of a new company launchanother person to actually become the exact it is found that they are like the non executive founder who is not dated you want to know that they are elected by the time I want to call them so that you actually build your own set of companies is well but you might not be spending like all the time that you want to continue doingbecause your work with value to your face which can help to do in switch that you might not be able to like raise money like to x y z there are many use this to be known that onelike Holi involving the different content that you could start adding faces to your own values right suppose an active filter copy use this tool of often because she after another has been introduced for a while then I want to let do other things while even though they know Tok video The Great parking 241we will have to be used as a male or female that doesn't matter and because this video will do well because of this place this is also start working in the audience when you slowly did you say out and display the venue launch its third phase on the back of the second salecontact with you and sodon't beat it you can do it take time away from it and also never lose it from your people remember you know their and thereAngel funding small and other Entrepreneur who is completely In My Dreams while this is a brutal question to ask ask it like to see any mistakes done by individual creators are you know just individual brands that are being built on social media like that one actors / influencesYouTube over the mistakes done by these people because I am sure that you guys have happened baby all kind of on that same grassland of content so you do understand ok that giraffe is playing wrong that Zebra spelling wrong so what would you like share the mistakes of individual creatorskeeping those inside the other batch that are somewhere in the middle andpeople look up to you life lessons at the different type of looking outside similarly I would say a smaller than a growing find your strength is great but is that you know something that you know you want to do when everybody you can do something else also and what is that so that basically what I would doit's too early to tell mistake grow your team don't just rely on yourself easy to burn out I know it the very hard rock and its very nice how will ideas come innovation in business understanding I think a lot of individual creators don't understand business they eitheron friends Audi actually don't monitise how much pic and monitise businessI know some creative have launched a merchandiser online then all is a lot bigger you can go I know that when you are outno basic all in all Street to true to what you want to do in life not everybody wants to go in the same weight source stay true to whatever you know I am coming back to pocketaces now at this stage your kind of the blueprint for a lot of this content houses let people look at once you can one go down that path sowater like a couple of things we've done correct and scale in Indore in the process of killing according to your cell like what would you look Nagin se Ok these two things 3 things were the best decisions for the overall journey and I was even ask about their challenges at this stageonly a line with one platform that everybody was aligning with Villa in socialize with Facebook that really helped us because we were different from the other people and more people then came you know about number 1 hour to hire a lot of people who have come from various walks of life right not people who areand I think last season and the culture was set up to show out board ideas for the people and the third one I thinkRon gaming Ark was the right time here we were so if volt it was quizzing then it was natural and that the added streaming any sports market and a lot of people to know that this is very different from what you guys do it right that we felt that it another kind of content and very powerful because gamerepeatable kind of found it even our best web series of friends at the Grove Levi's men's series everybody likes watch again and again I am a huge fan at watch daily all tenses many time time for the finite again at the time when it comes to repeatability of content and hence solving border giving is is an amazing job finding that was a greatcal and what your challenges at this stage is the overall so number one challenge is how do we grow our news channels that includes our animation channel Jumbo are input in Shell as well as giving app logo write how we grow it for the morning what I think the number to challenge is how do we grow ourwrite something with definitely are doing currently and it's not easy because I know it goes back its reminiscent of the fittings in many ways where there are a few bad decisions I got very early on in the life cycle of the right so and because we are well known in the ecosystem the have the relationship but everyoneand of glucose and stuff like that so true to what you believe is your kind of content and still making large scale so positive that something that we are currently doing and you know it a good morning that I think in I think the individual Express exact love that content but they are scared because it's something new for thesubscribers you know think that they should face a very expensive showtechnohead nodes of the business but also in this age people motivation with 70 fighting the challenges that in ups and down of the world how do you keep marching forward how do you keep your head on how do you keep 250 people motivated and how do you stay true to audiences and not have this pressure Kiya Re now it is coming back to the Kuchh Bhi Bata Do you knowyour audience's one of the challenge to adjust not on scale all even have to figure out there is only that was content that the contrary cli create product so far as we have a more people can create more content or growth what do you do to get exponential growth how do you use what you will doWindows trim videos about very very cosy and some cool ideas for I think if you want to talk you series launch some new initiatives which is how can we scale beyond just killing contact what do you what you think that's a very interesting point in fact that something I've been thinking about for the podcast alotjust bring in a few nuggets about podcasting you so I feel that while there is a massive podcasting wave that can help the country currently the supply is much more than the demand I see the numbers we do on a audio streaming platforms and it's not that great right now but was still the number one podcast in the country the number of countries like thinking like this I am hopeful about the future of India is a very voice oriented country audio oriented country but there isn't that much spacethat many players in this is not a very optimistic person I am just give you the ground reality of what happening in that space the game with podcasting is much more than just creating audio content you can't just sit and talk about random things as reassuring flow in the conversation that art of broadcasting you either get order because you make a gas comfortable that we other aspect of it and you not this too many dynamics that people take for granted so I always askhow do I get more people to not listen to the podcast 1990 cup of tea Brittany snow about the partisan make a stronger podcasting brand and the solution had is bar ok now because I use my own cameras and equipment for this I have access to all this raw material is about what I can repurpose the raw material for sofa experimenting now with the shortcut and experimenting now with highly edited videos and that's my hunt for the way forward and I feel like summer seasoncreative soap a kind of know what will work I have with that little bit of that instant but my point are saying all this is you need a think tank with your team with Kand only be you and I'm at that stage of hiring right now from content perspective that I need you kids now the 22 year olds to think of how we can repurpose what we can use it for now this is the whole dynamic while hiring you want to ensure that part of the symbol of culturally to you are motivated and all thatYouTube breakdown like what your learning about the whole scaling up process how do scales to other people's Minds like what have you learnt about it a part of the brain storm and even believe they on certain ideas from the based on I think if people feel like owner they go above and beyond in actuallyimplementing adesign thinking is a great way to involve other people in brainstorming and in ceiling light the only Idea and thence cause is amazing the next that so I would say go with one of these type ofscale potters beyond 24 hours that you as when we have right how much to ask questions and get the people answer how that looks very different right so I am God and it looks you can use different types of investing C for you to INRlife to first record interviewed and added a long time for you to find only few people who you really want to interviewis informed that from creating a revolution revolution create karne ke liyewhich is we are next episode 3 months later on we do like 7 8 million a monthhaha right now your showing that you have the look up to youno no diarrhoeayou know I know the very not usually ask people that three life lessons but since the ending this podcast speaking about design thinking could you could you kind of give a summary of what design thinking is because my consensus both from the outside and after speaking with you is that is being a massive part of however fuelled growth on filter copy and does not taught in Indian schools could you explain it your just from very practical perspective and also may we suggest peoplebooks are some sources of knowledge that they can't turn to movies that they can turn to for inspiration / useful tools implemented it onlyC transformation program and programme for young companies looking to write up on all aspects about how you should plan for your transformation right and scale is so design tool to help you come up with new ideas to do you think it has for many steps one is empathy why you learn about the clients are thecreating this step to is Slay means co-creating no judgement no discussion any idea work once you're basically understood the problems of your client to solve you frame a statement around which a problem stick around which you want to brainstorm example how might weprovide more entertainment to the 2 million people who follow the simple question and then become the fair exercise by you just go and brainstorm any idea what ok anything from let's open a gym to like let's take them to Mars anything what right now just me and you do thisok keep this idea to planet earth that could be one constrain you could keep this idea under $100 right keep this idea implementable by a team of four people right then you start putting constraints basically and that's how you start narrowing down some of those ideas and then you reach a may be set or stop fibre 10 ideasthat you didn't talk about every team and I to pilot maybe three of them right and people from within the exercise become the owner of those Pilots and and take it forward so it makes people feel that you are big participants in the journey of the creation of the startup and hence they have to finish it now you can go to Stanford the deal abdesign lab website online and you can find you can actually run on design thinking exercise in a company Tomorrow they have the tools of how to do it and it's something simple design gift you know on the websiteI think this is the kind of stuff that actually helped initially filtercopy break out and generally pocketaces break out that you all have broadened Western Flair to an Indian product which is you know what people say about ok you should gold USA study in the Navy layout of you want to business you can bring back your learnings from the that not everyone does broccoli like that would you guys have doneupgrading as well which is very important and ok ok mam the final question for you is because this is a women's entrepreneurship sort of series we started on the podcast the girls who join Monk entertainment and bigger biceps with the one who is the real like Game Changers for us Like I Remember specifically you know the kind of inputs the game with just changed staff of completely so whatwhat does the family and energy add to the hole entrepreneurial game according to you because I know that even Anirudh and Ashwin would have thought of something when they said OK you know it should be brought on as a co-founder so like what what was what do you thinkso gender diversity of economic background was the versity of right you need that number 13 because unfortunately most you know workplaces by default are much more music you that someone thatwrite a note saying it's better or it was its different and that's what matters because I think that the nurturing the way the nature is different right so one of my most favourite thing to do is to help out how to grow their interestfighting beat 2 add different type of tree de do I add different model quotes are different between men and women I am much more sensitive towards joke sorting types of content so the filter is there and hence we never give a chance usually forthis question of this thatI think women in leadership position and a lot due to sitting inside it shows that is a future and it makes them more confident so they become better at jobs in become better at speaking they become better at pointing items when they see it happening orthere are more women on top we are more than we are about 50% women in Hindi and girls are so I think this is whatso you do need all sorts of people in terms of diversity of cause basic cultural and ethical values into pieces thank you ma'am this is one of the now I guess I wanted on the show I don't know why twin delayed so long as the end of the lock down but I really really appreciated I appreciate you sharing your knowledge your loveshop nearest to sign of a true entrepreneur your all about sharing your about elevating yourself and let people around you so just really thank you really appreciate this to do this respect to everythingin which country and improving your smile touch which I think is a national servicethe nation and two and two men that I didn't have a lot of guidance I didn't have to keep trying to put that out for the world through people like yourself for sure like I feel again like coming back to pocketaces because of the Rapid ATI of your Gionee does Vitamin E learningI am sure they have the same conversation with Ashwin Anirudh feeling completely different things which is also on the cards definitely November thank you and I am waiting for the logged on to get them so I can actually see it and probably the same room with you and jam at some point but thank U I genuinely appreciate this I looked it up always spoken Li Hai liya filtercopy when I am gone forfin Janab just how everyone is so you had increase your like and dislike by those for the rest of us so thank youfor the rest of us so thank you thank you so much

Ganguly autobiography in is written in detail about Steve was team and how he wanted to bring that that kind of culture to the new age Indian team that when was the first guy who brought to Indian cricket but also Ihighlight the bowling unit because the bowling unit we feel like you're so when you're facing that Indian batting line up with all our great Seva Gambhir Ganguly Dravid Tendulkar what were your condition Laxman in a what were your conversations in that bowling unit amongst Each Other because you are out there aggressively like to go and get wickets so what would your talk about was always strategy was it aggression because wheneveryone saw the Amazon Prime series the test and sure you have is well that opened up the other side of cricket from curious about that what were the conversations like a was like you have the mixture at the time that a friend you have to know that strikes this is kind of off what but I like what I am not a wife and sports as difficulttest match know that the gazette of right now with the guys that it was shocked at the bottom of every week in a row in a table in the word of Sachin Tendulkar in an adplace where was a character in the word in style with the laws of the game only within the lost the plot and write leave letter for someone watching all the sitting on chair baseh1b Application now have a sign that says it's a lovely

much and at the same time we had planned on this podcast this book but how important mental toughness for any athlete but especially for a fast bowler so I want to highlight two aspects of your career while you're playing your physical fitness game and your mental fitness game how did those two games evolve after you started playing professionallyquestion I think when you purchase my 30 trailer cricketer more the first time in general when a young Rishabh pant wife her India pretty sure that I think and then I were a number of months is it becomes 20% andauto strike because you've only got a because your talents and kelvin is it something that you can go in phones not far from home smart search strings on other in terms of physical fitness all thatATI kam I can apply this label but why she believed my kind of this level if you have a good sportYogi se and your furnace for me as well sometimes that you are you like your survey about it but it is that why is it keeps getting that that is very sweet and its service which number is this can cause a day or it could be upstairs and has to be the mental strength is believed that you could harness that road networkyou are my time period and you work skills and you be good but that's how do you train that like I'm sure it's not everyone's cup of tea just have it from the get-go so is it the teammates who can give you the mental strength they do make a meditation on how do you work and it's me your familymy mother and my dad was that metal strikes never give up never side and get lucky and why should we buy for carrots and another been married for over 50 years the other maximizing people of the season 4yes I am then it becomes have stubborn you are stubbornness is sometimes trendyporn because the message stubborn

being stubborn in SY and not sponsored it's that that that stuff is there when someone says you can do itSupreme diesel they also say that fast bowlers of the craziest people on the cricket field is that the same thing but also one of the kind of dive into that question is what you mentioned about fast twitch muscle fibressay that people are genetically gifted with more of one of the to see the gifted with more fast which a most unusual people gifted with most of which are better endurance athletes but people of gifted with more fast which are more explosive athletes to say someone like a Brett Lee your fast bowler would have a lot of fast muscle fibres probably and someone who is like a great test batsman might have slow twitch fibres vol no but how would you can talk about your own fitness bright like how did that gobig scene of the performance of the Indian cricket team change after Kohli introduce fitness CEO and MD Wasim you and assignments and se like Ricky Ponting who fit

the answer but she'll correct you and answer uses I don't have the time you can be sure that the Mukesh Ambani your weekend busier than a Bill Gates son you are aware of this that each one of these leaders have their own way of constantly learning and updating who is a powerful leader a powerfulone in whose room when you enter and come out you feel powerful you feel energetic a power Les leader is one in whom you go your scared and you come out your like half of what you were earlier captain Raghu Raman so thank you foradirindi show once again 3 times in a row yes we just got the Hindi episode which is about the army this is a second English episode of first one was received extremely well and not only people right into me about thanking me for a particular gas a lot of young Aspiring Army cadets Lord people want to build a career that were that episode DID for the world honestly this one I am doing it from a very personal selfish perspectiveextract all your learning the you had a very complex kar Rio like I feel like after the army evolved into this corporate Badshah as we call it and then you've done a bunch of different things in the corporate world was had a stint with Reliance you work with Mukesh Ambani scored in the last podcast while I know that's not a big deal I got a sell some masala to my audiencesMukesh Ambani Australian done and it is corporate leader of a very very different calibre in a very very different year and I don't know 10 years 15 years down the line when they write the history of the way Indian telecom evolved and how people have got access including millions of people who problem now have access to shows like yours and I should be given life to a completely different medium of learningKrishna Healthcare is name is that a person who is this episode but you've also got an access to a lot of power full people famous people so called rich people over the course of your career you had learning from them and I know that even those fears learners and I know personally so let's talk with your career and as we do every forgetting rest of your ask you for my tangentiashall we start from giving the army and this happened 1998 it was 15th August I remember my last that I am a sense of humour independence day I left them and I actually like many things that happened to Army Fox when they leave their initial first point of contact is usually an ex army person who is left head of you and and in my case it was a very lucky that I had caused made an orifice metre unit office I wasmy unit call captain alag Parashar who was the essence of short service of severe left before me and he had joined the Mahindra group and at that point when I was leaving I was my last posting was in a place called Ahmednagar which you might be aware about 3 hours away from Pune and what happened was that institution call the Mahindra United world college the you WC United world college is a very famous InstituteGoogle topmatic to encourage all listeners who are in the age group to appear for their 10th exam they should look at this you WC as a concept its Revolutionary the one in India is sponsored by sponsored by the Mahindra group and that's why is called the Mahindra United world college but it's on top of a mountain and Mulshi and Marxist 200 students it has closed about 80 to 90 countries being represented by a very very rich multicultural environmentnovel concept of education where they say that we put kids who are from different cultures who have learnt their own cultures but are still a teenage weather open to learning other cultures and put them together and so you put a German and Israeli and French and Spanish gai in one room so when they move away from there they know that at least that is one good German whom I can talk to your so it is to produce this college of leaders so to speakleaders who as they grow will know each other multicultural that was the concept of this school was being set up in this is the year 1998 when internet was still and you guys don't even remember the tone of a modem used to make that weird funny sound and it was 14 kpbs was considered to be like I speed it was those days and I was still in the army as it was my last month last couple of months and I remember captain Alok Parasharfrom Pune once and saying that recently got this thing called the internet and this something I didn't understand this stuff you can you just come over and out of state on our side of the table because we are discussing with a few when does about another scanner internet connectivity and all that's so I can I knew enough about computers at that time don't in the yes I was working on a few projects which required me to learn a lot about duraabout technology and that's another advantage by the way of working in the government and specially the forces you get you get to work with technology which is head of ahead of its time I mean I don't think I learnt my computers in Military College of telecommunication engineering and city is a short course but I love my programming on mainframe and mainframe I'm in I don't Indian MNCs could afford a mainframe that point of time so you do have a lot of exposureit was learnt also with my job because I was in a branch of the army which is the mechanised infantry and that did have a second generation missiles which had some sort of computing power on board and so you need to understand the fundamentals of computing across a large part of learning in life is your personal passion so I was passionate about computers so I came to attend this meeting and this was I am seeing this college for the first time it is still underit getting built and they were a few when does water come to give the proposals and essentially the given on feasibility report said that no internet connectivity can be brought over on the reasons that the reason is that it was 40 kilometres away from Pune and Pune was the nearest city where there was internet to begin with secondly this was on top of a mountain which is the middle of a reserve forest so you either had to draw cable all the way from Pune to this place a fibreOriya to setup relay station radio based relations radio base station could not be set up because the area from Pune to the college it was interspersed with mountains and these mountains where is a forest so not only would have to put a tower on each one of them but you also have to service the tower which made you that track to reach that place to fill up business it was not feasible and drawing a fibre optic cableall the way from Pune right up to the college was also in practical because MTNL BSNL broadband cable for a school at the other end and school which because it is an academic institution pay one fourth of the fee anyway so 1 customer they won't do that so anyway this is a non feasibility report was given and I remember sitting there and that table and I think I just matar it was stupid sentence to say but I can I set itTamil connectivity can be provided in the Glacier why can't it be done here very silly statement to make because it takes a different them with but the then headmaster Dr David wilkerson who set up this college in Kurnool downsizing give the listener some contacts you also served on the Siachen Glacier me and 80% of the Indian Army so it's that that the Glacier was being that but I meant was that it can be done in difficult placesof course the contacts is completely different and that was ACB statement to make but the headmaster he caught on to that and that the end of the story I went back to Nagar in a couple of weeks I got another message from pressure and said that can you come out Bombay this a meeting in Bombay result ok fine and I came on a Saturday at a member and it was in Mahindra Towers to the first time I am saying I still remember I tell some of my friends even now that when he was telling need to look forMakkhi said this All India Radio tower is the biggest Landmark and I now sometimes on the ceiling you can see that was the cause of the skyscraper that I come but that point of time Mahindra Towers 6th floor building was called Mahindra Tower right so I went there for this meeting and Mr Harish Mahindra Anand Anand father was alive and process personal loan he was passionate about this project and it's a Saga of the project I would have got done but for him and they willteam sitting there and I remember David wilkerson introducing me to them and saying that he said that he can do it so I said I didn't say I can do it as it can be done would you be willing to take up this and I said final give it a shot and that's how I joined the Mahindra college with the very limited objective of setting up the internet connectivity and honestly and I think that's a philosophy have followed learnt and followed throughout my lifeand I think that's what the army teacher I don't know how the hell am I had no idea and their three companies which are given an feasibility report and these are three technology companies I did not know how I was going to do it but I knew I was going to get it done Tu Hi karna hai so then of course I haven't figured out ok to various people talk to companies who might be able to help this that all those things and then we found a break to the breakthrough was that while they wereno way to connect a fibre optic cable all the way from Pune to this college reason papa mountain in a village called Pavilion by the way those days the telephone exchange there was not even digital it was actually a mechanical Telephone Exchange coronavirus in movies that no dial goes up and turns around and then Falls back and it's completely Mechanical so no way that the entire system would have to be there so I went to the director oftelcom their doctor Rupaiya I still remember his name and doctor Rupaiya I went to him and I told him that you know we need this connectivity and he said the same thing happens at the other end of this pipeline there is a school for commercial use this is not know viability and all that was so this was the 1999 so I just told him in a week but this 200 kids there and they come from the city different countries there keep asking me one question they save India can blow nuclear bomb why can't you givenet connectivity To Sharab jawab de do mere ko Mein jakar bacchon Ko Bata deta hun the country we have to find a way out and that in a become that became that was I think my first learning that if you make something larger than just some bits and bytes if you make something that is a a dragon that has to be killed and a task that has to be done for The Prestige for the owner then usually impossibleget done because everyone put their shoulder to it everyone out there in my Twitter and this project got a life of its own we also called IT project maker in Adobe Cloud messenger and is also again comes from my experience in such a way that is also called me and so we decided eventually the solution that was found was that if we cannot get connectivity using radio write up to Pune up to where canconnectivity and there's a place called pirangut which now is a big industrial hub at that point of time was hardly the one Telephone Exchange there so the Telecom authorities agreed to lay a fibre optic cable up to pirangut and from pirangut we were supposed to pick it up using radio mode in which at that point of time a 17th kilometre radium radium is probably one of the longest links for an education student definitely was the longest link and that what setup and that was the first time that internet came to that limit200 interested in that area or more that plays listeners if you go to Mulshi you can still see that power which is on top of a mountain which actually started not only the internet but the first telecom services to come into that valley camp because of that way because it was at a at a very high point not affect the Mahindra group bought a mountain because that was the only place from where where where window which was a line of sight to Karan good so we actually travelled foot by foot every part of that landfrom where we had our line of sight and got the line of sight and reconnected that I still remember the message that first message which went out from there I understand this is like about 100-150 alternative to come from other countries and they have no link with their and there you have to communicate with your parents are there was there actually case remember that time in Yugoslavia the bombing was going on NATO bombing was going on and I was a student from Yugoslavia whose city was being born and had no way of knowing whether a spiritok not ok no Amit telephones were the only communication that also STD trunk all this that show the first time we got connectivity is the first message which went out was Geography is history in the first message that be sent from the college and Mahindra college actually became the eighth college to get internet connectivity including two colleges in other countries who still have not got the connectivity and we got it I still remember Mr Harish Mahindra Mini Game with the mandatehe told me it has to be done before August so I asked message what's the Harry and he said that I don't want a single student who decided to come to India to this college to turn around and say that my education was shot changed because I chose India so any student who passes out from here including the first batch cannot say that I did not get internet that's the criticality and the vision of that not to say thatso anyway video and One That Got done I was invested by Anand to come to the they have this technology board in which they have the scores of all the technology companies interesting leave and other companies which given on feasibility report was a Mahindra company and that's why I think they want to do figure with this guy who did it and another is called her because I was only representing the team that didn't the team consisted of many people including the the duties ofbig thing for them so I came here for a presentation and after the presentation Anand this was my job and I was brought in for this particular project not the project was over I was basically looking at other stuff and had a couple of hours from other companies like IBM and the others are looking at evaluating options there what were you thinking after the army light after you like seen and learn to whatever you seen and learnt in the army it was a different world when I camethe civil war but not the good part was I and like many of my other cosmetic come from NDA Sainik School in the knowledge that I actually had worked in the treatment of the graduate from Venkateshwara so I knew a little bit more about Ronaldo reference to incorporation all that I thought it was a different world I wanted to explore and so Anand point blank ask me why don't you want to the group said ok bye notand fascinating and I still think about that conversation it was really because you asked me what would you like to do and I told him point blank I used to be a company command the Armies give me a company and burst out laughing and he said that this is the first time someone is to be made as to do that and they were three companies that point of time which were which they were looking for SEO and one of them happen to beauto Mart India which today is called First Choice over the second so 1st lesson The founder and then was Nikhil Raghavan who was for me and then I became the third see you at first it was a job that I think I was totally unprepared for because well I knew how to do teams and projects in this and I had no idea about pnl finances and because that's not something that you are taught in the army ever I am India me your entire financial planning concertmaking your message will and your salary slip match if it matters it's Ok with doesn't match don't drink for a few days and it will match your financial planning but here I had to actually I remember still at to count the number of zeros to figure out whether it was a lakh crore 1 crore and then the private equity guys with converted into millions of dollars and had to start all over again so it was totally new area from email order mistakes but I think I found fascinating about the Mahindra group and Anand specially thathad I am asking you what I had I for taking a bet on people and an they would normally be people who would never ever get entry into the organisation through the normal channel and this is a great lesson I learnt from it he would take a point on people who would have some sort of A Maverick behaviour or some sort of a streak which was not normal positive accentmaybe I can call it that maybe you can call it the his ability to spot a can-do attitude or whatever it is that this that for his podcast many days with you but he would then give a failure free hand he would not have not tried to look over your shoulder and out there and I know that I know this now because those days I did make a few mistakes because I try to translate my style of leadership from the Army directly into the corporate which doesthere are two different words and he helped me correct this mistake sometimes in a nice way sometimes and not a such a nice way and I can I cut my teeth in that Organisation in in First Choice learnt a lot about technology about the web and and that's by the way the first Technology boom.com Babu 216 these companies like eBay and so many of them better now big ones at that point of time as fledgling comebing bing asset fund than those things Technology being Technologies like data bases how do you make two different bottles talk to each other like First Choice auto portal which was also and read it and then it was on Yahoo so how do you interface with different Technologies different processes how can you have a one username and password seamlessly going through three different portals but that it was very complex and every timehow can I think the great thing was all of us were trying to figure it out so it wasn't like you know somebody is sitting in Mahindra Towers new it all nobody knew it all it was like the youngsters were discovering it on a daily basis and it was evolving that and I think we've always it was a great experience learning that parali actually I was fascinated by the area of information security and I think in First Choice had reached the point of time where my capability to lead the organisation wouldnot be enough for the organisation to go to the next level and there was a change of so Vinay Sangeet took over from it and then I moved from their back to my Parent company which was Mahindra network Services Limited which constructed this entire Potter and there I started entity called the Mahindra special Services Group now this was the story it is what is information security today information security is like very well known to everythat's why you have this password theft and credit card frauds in money being Sahi find out emails being intercepted videos being stolen Twitter account being hacked and messages being sent out in your behalf of all these things are happening today because it's much more involved but when it began at that point of time basically people were completely unaware of anything other than a username and a password that said they would write down the past they still do it but at that point of time it was much more rudimentary the write down their passwords in places anddurgandh when internet cafe and and start checking the mail not realising that all cafes could have a keylogger in it and the Goodwill login all your keystrokes including your email id and password still happens when the one of the most common ways of hacking is harvesting password from the show information security was actually making its presence felt because a lot of now transactions were happening online money was being moved around banking was beginning to become online banking portalso this was a space that would require a lot of attention and I still remember so I need to get I have the business plan to say that we need to focus on information security and at that point of time I wasn't even thinking of starting a business of it was thinking more for Mahindra and Mahindra Mini to have better information security so I decided without without seeking permission I decided to do a p********** testing is called p********** testing nowthose days it was just me feeling around to see whether I can get access into and I remember I sent a mail to Anand Mahindra saying that this is the first half of your password and I hope I've got your attention I need to explain this concept to you because when anyone gets the first of his password said to him as they usually get the attention of the centre so I explain the concept that I just want to do a test of Mahindra and when I did the Testament of course those days more scopelekin Legacy because information security wasn't really didn't even know and at that point of time so then I remembered it leaders were present and I did the presentation which basically can you can restrict the VIT protection team and all of that cause I told you I was very very nice when I will I think that time playing to the gallery and other is doing overkill but in effect I gotmandate to implement it for Mahindra and Mahindra and that's where it began the canal of the company began their and there was another kind enough to speak to the kotak and today I decided to give us a chance and that was our first external assignment 5 lacs I still remember first external mandatory just two of us who started the company can then of course it grew and grew bigger and bigger and bigger and their cause it's considered to be one of the leading company is more importantTwinkle Lord of our team members of that company went on to become some very very good information security practices and matter of fact even as a speaking to you now most of the foundation of information security in the big four are you will find that the DNA comes from Mahindra SSC that's where they come from eliquis Menu the leaders Ben 10 writing that is something that was exceptionally proud of even managed to do recruitment in 2 -ab always find people were far better than me so when I will be one recruiting from people were leaving the Army they were like 283 soda for owners who like toppers of their batches who would come and join the note was surrounded by incredibly capable people who are far better think was far better in a far more competent people and many of them have gone on to create their own I am MSM Kumar is one of them is now its several companiesanything specifically in this domain for users think the security is a state of mind and most hacker I can tell you that I have spent almost four decades in that life in that world I don't think till now at 256 bit encryption has been and cracked so you don't need to go for fight well what usually happens in the human error is always a human error and human beings can be cracked all the time like logically human beings areI am in the psychological or what they call social engineering sarong phrase but it's actually mind hacking the back into your mind that make you do what it's a bit like if you were to ask some very important person secretary where is the boss she will never tell because she's been trained not to tell what to say when is Anand coming back from China Silk correct or not in China is in Japan will correct she won't give the answer but she'll correct you so if you understand the psychologyof criminals because you have to fight them then you understand how to create a protective barriers against them and large part of that is actually the user education educating the user about what can go wrong how it can go wrong and others think so anyway so that continued for a while and then that company came to a size where like most Consulting firms it really could not grow beyond the Consulting firms is a boutique Consulting firms don't reallygrow in scale because it's very manpower and personality intensive and scaling means adding more people which means more cost so eventually you come to that sweet spot of a certain amount of a turnover beyond which if you try to take it than the thickness was away and now it's something that and by the sun as doing many other things also within the group in the Mahindra group and learning a lot learning about how corporate work lanternabout sales because I think one of the most important things that everybody should learn is sales because with sales you learn one very important lesson and that lesson is not to take rejection personally you want pitch to 10 customers only three of them will by Vikram with three out of 10 bill by the remaining 7 when they reject you then not rejecting you the individual there is acting and they may be rejected for a number of reasons our mother having to do with you but that ability to take rejection ability tono problem will come back again we'll try again and all of that that actually was a very solid training ground also I knew that unlike many of my colleagues I did not have a formal education in the management theories of formal as in an MBA so I have not studied advertising and not studied finance and not study but as a see you I needed to understand all that I need to understand the nuances of that and I still remember they were friendsmy friends call prabir Talati use again very big and the private equity space today I remember going literally to his house and sitting at his feet I remember sitting on the floor will take out his laptop and Samjha Deve is DNA kya hota hai and you explain to me line by line the items on it and say this is IR this is internal rate of return this is what investors look at the learning from them and another friend cal Vivek Kama to actually had this company called Matrix which meinlot of celebrity celebrities in you you into a managed by him and he at that point of time used to work in an advertising Agencies so he would teach me the nuances of advertising that you give only one message at a time you don't confuse the audience with too many messages in our stars literally learning the nuances of various different trade crafts that are required in in in business from the master and and sitting there will be found is one of the bestfor me to study like that's what my school road my college always going to somebody who has been really good that subject and just set up to revise kar dena mere ko pata Le just listen to you when I understand it has some questions I lost you and all of that so I understood the importance of learning at a very early stage even when I came into the corporate that you need to learn not only about your area of specialisation but every other vertical that will affect youthis is a story that I've often narrated to people to illustrate another aspect and I think it's important to to narrate the story to explain what are the two roots you can take in in in a corporate or in any career what are the two roots you can take and how making that choice I can actually and in a different result so in a certain yearI was the team which was sent from Mahindra 4 people went from Mahindra this was the team was led by Mr Bahadur she was at that point the CF of Mahindra and Mahindra and he is currently a Sabhi member Sabhi your RBI member was I think and the second person was built to last Jago who until quite recently was heading the IT sector for and we had Vineet Nayar who was then headingMBT Mahindra before Sathyan the Mahindra British Telecom entity Tech Mahindra is a place called that point of time and a very junior CEO of a small company commander ssg mama soybean in my blade mid thirties was later teacher that when the time we were sent to meet Michael Bloomberg so a lot of people in my peer group ask that how are you selected to understand these three people goingwas that Mr Bloomberg and Mr Mahindra met each other in one of the most conferences they shook hands in the said we should do some work together so Bloomberg had told him that ok send a team from your side and we'll see what we can do when all of that can I was part that it now I remember many of my younger initiative asking me that what was the root and how did you how are you pick to go there what what happened and I think I try to answer that question to myself also and II found the answer which is the answer I want to share with you are I think this particularly defines a way of thinking about work a way of thinking about life so the story actually goes back many years to three years before that when I was part of a company called Mahindra Consulting and this was a division of Arkansas Tech Mahindra special Services Group is a division of 15 Consulting and we were would participate in one of these responses can of conferences so we were supposed to make brushless I will not be the PR person wasoppam Pasand Rajput make a brochure that lady who is very Competent Person who is now made up of a very very big company she can I came to all of us practices and set can you give me a paragraph about your practice what are you doing can you give me a paragraph for whatever whatever we provide this service is Lal all of that to go to the pressure after the first proof came printers and the first proof that came to us for the draught and check kar lo aapkacheck my iPhone 12 typos corrected it and all that and then as a habit I check the remaining portion of the remaining Ones I found some mistakes in the other person reading mistakes but it was the floor of the language with every person it individually it was like we also do this we also do this we also they didn't like flow together very well so I just corrected the floor to the best of my ability of course give it to this lady workers must have done much better job on it and it got printed and all that happenedso that even bought over next year the same thing was to be done again but this part of the span of time the head of popcorn had left us and join another company is so she was in there any moment when the sea was trying to figure out how to get it done the printer to the so there is one captain was involved in it last time in all of that I was called as I can you handle that my job is not my business but I learnt that point of time that you must adopt a one and halfyour mindset that mindset is I will do my job completely but I'll also handle half portfolio I'll take over some part which is giving a headache to the CEO of the CA for some part difficult customer or a difficult Territory or something where I can take my Axis bandwidth and provide in that area not because I want to do it for them by want to learn about copper I want to learn about communication I want to learn how much time does it take for a printer to turn around the brochure I want to learn what is thebetween Oxford and letterpress printing out to learn which colour works very well in an advertisement I learnt that yellow is the best colour an advertisement because it stays longest in the sun when you put a holding the yellow colour fades out the last and that is why I always better and better contrast in the sky is used in traffic lights also do you learn these kind of things only when you go in that half portfolio not your portfolio with the one and half foot is generally a very good professional lesson that always do more than what are sowhen somebody is ask mean that how did you reach that plays the answer is here the answer is by correcting a paragraph that is not your business that is somebody else's business the answer is by putting a shoulder in some may I know how to do it Itna Jyada give some To Nahin yaar let me have some of these are you need another member in that interview panel I am more than happy to come and offer that to you are you want to Bounce of something this construct of being able to spread a certain amount ofmojo settlement of your resources in an area that is directly not yours but somebody else's not doing it with some altruistic mind set that that is a wrong approach your conduct yourself that I am bringing it is more to say I am getting an opportunity to learn about this address I am not been graded on that if his cock c** thing goes down the drain know you want to ask me why did your copy do not work is not my job but I am getting an opportunity to learn from somebody else and getting openthis post me for example to read books like David Ogilvy on advertising I learnt about communication I learnt about various different things because it was a task that I taken on I think this philosophy is something that I have carried forward entirely in my life and I remember after this stint in Mahindra ssg there was a joint venture with Mahindra and Mahindra was doing at that point of time with b and for the joint venture a so was being search for an eyeactually Anand told me that we're picking us the so on I was at that point of time again a given credit one of the youngest so as to be given a Portfolio which was potentially this large I was a bit but 42-43 at that point of time and much much bigger Canvas Canvas that just while I was in the army but it was much much bigger than that because it was about defence procurement this is about interface with the government it was about understanding procurementseason all of those things so when I went into the JV also I would often try to find things that are not part of my portfolio for example in Mahindra we had a relationship with several other organisations like Grand and a few others and I would I would take up that role it's ok I will stop at that interface because it would teach it would teach a lot more I think this philosophy is something that Iright to encourage all people to practice and again with the Caveat that you are not taking on that have put for you because you're doing any one of favour your doing it because you will get an opportunity to learn something that is not in your area and no strategic leader at least in my thinking no strategic leader can ever become a strategic leader without understanding domains that are not Har ko computer are you can be the greatest cfbbut not want to become a CEO unless you understand marketing analyst you understand human resources you understand technology is not possible United master it but you need to have a very good understanding of how it works what are the nuances of that what the compulsion so that if you don't understand that you may be very good in your slow and you will reach to the head of yourself but it will be very unlikely that you will be the overall commander because you are all commander needs to know a little bit about many other facets because all of this message working together with meShri delivers the end result was that may be in terms of taking a company to the next level or finances over this is a good example of people say oh you have to have an MBA to progress in the corporate world would you would you say that a few of these things if you are out perform everyone else by taking on more work you do have a better chance for progress so I will not advocate if somebody say so is it important to do an MBA or notnot have an opinion is away on its own for example in my last assignment or even before that I had juniors reporting to me let se 50 of them and if somebody told me out of this 5020 are from Ivy League colleges 20 hour from B second level B Schools and 10 are without MBA honestly I won't be able to tell you because thatentry ticket into our corporate after that it depends on who is performing how and who is what fashion who is what I I genuinely think passion outweighs I would any day want to have a colleague who is passionate and hungry rather than have a Harvard graduate will show me 120 slide presentation white cannot be the right so nobody needs to be shownMichael porter's five forces on white consider what people are looking for is how can it be done now that doesn't take away the one thing to them that doesn't take a minute and mini executive MBA programs after that are done from Kellogg pregnancy at several other places and a possible on great frameworks there is no denying that you come across manage like apps work to studied under Deepak Jain the legendary head of strategy and all that stuffin spending 1 hour in his presence will give you experience which is work like a decade with the process like reading a book you might read 400 pages and find one Idea and that and that one Idea could alter your entire life not going to give you a completely new so it's never about the number of pages in number never about the amount of time that you spend with the person but it's about your curiosity and your passion and to seek out those opportunities I still remember Deepak Jain came toaur Aadha conductor session for Mahindra leaders and overall Mahindra Quanto this place in Nashik where mind is a training establishment Bodhi vriksha something is called and he Vivo 1818 leaders and he was there and he did his soul strategy for whatever but I made it a point to make sure that I was in the car which was dropping into the airport with anothermore speaking is mind articles have been asking very important questions but that one are getting with him was actually more valuable than others more value added that didn't come because anyone send you invite I am really is one thing I of an advocate you never get an invitation To Hai till not even sure the table is already crowded train booking people on the table you have to move chairs and your to pull your chair and sit in the high table and that you can only do by taking the initiativeis not there in the time table but hey Saman usko to drop into the airport the gadi is going let me say that ability to find the opportunities against the prerogative of an MBA or not to MBA but I think non MBA have to has a lot more and because they are 2016 lot more in their lives they are perhaps much better at grabbing splitting opportunitiespeople who come again I'm being very cautious you are you will find people on both sides but people we've got a very formal structure of solving problems whenever there is a problem will try to go back to ok study with soldier then try to look for the hammer for this particular nail where as people who have you don't have that structure may sometimes I actually had the audacity to try something which is completely and thought I am not saying the lal sexymany of them will feel and they do that I think a nice mix is ideal for an organisation so and Organisation I think should ideally have some people very structured thinking and some people who have unstructured and creative thinking and create teams which work together and that something in it in my entire career I've always had one or two colleagues who are extrathinkers who are you now so I have a colleague of mine with my work not just here we will discuss on the same unit in the army and we work together in several places now he is a slick stickler for detail and we look at a spreadsheet like the sun is XL apply that understands panel understands the nitty gritties hi compliments in area where I am extremely weak will be seen on my part to try to pickbut in that area because I don't have a Flair for second even if I did I it's too late for me to work so hard to get into that space is far better for me to have a relationship with 56 such people that whenever I have an assignment which requires the skill I am able to call those people to assist me in that project rather than trying to replicate or developer skill which I am not going to be good at as good at this person is so Ithat ability to recognise ki Maravi carier Hai yah mein nahin kar sakta hun Ab Karunga bhi to ismein jitni mehnat Lagegi is not worth the return of investment is much easier for me to hand over control of this area to somebody who understands is much better is passionate about it is much better qualified than me in this far more intelligent in the space I think that ability is something that comes usually if you don't have a formal structured education what do you have aab actually as things happen in life usually you find that your weakest things are also your strongest things because it had an effort to not really it's the other way that so for example I was in school as a pretty but still a very very bad to nice come first second first second from the bottom of the class and a large part of that and he still wear a large part of that is that I am never able to remember the so I cannot remember long acronymsremember you know 17 points account number 6 things is very difficult for me remember phone number only phone number and member in my own number and I don't remember any other number I have a learning disability in that space but the same disability give me the ability to make connections so I can look at the entire picture and save it to this idea this idea and this idea together and have them together we will have something completely new to the ability to create a brothergive the term the ability to cross pollinate to take an idea from one place connected with another man and come up with a solution which is completely different I think it comes from my inability to remember numbers to be good in calculations to do Mental Math and all that because I am weak in that area at the ability to join the dots actually I was talking to Mira when we were coming here about this famous story about three m i don't know your aware of itpm used to be a glue making company days make Blues and accidentally in trying to make a super group which would be able to stick material Black metal and metal together something went wrong in the formula and the Glue became extremely weak so weak that even if you stick it in paper and used it the paper will just come out and that have the three important start so that 3M post it started because a glue which was supposed to beWrong turn out to be very weak and it had a completely different application and I think that is true of all human beings all individuals including the ones that are formal education system says at duffer I don't buy that story for the simple reason that by that logic all the 98 percentile people who are completing their MBA in today any even reasonably near to be school is cutting off at 96% 98% 99what happens to the remaining people are there to lay down and I or are They supposed to say that we will work as you know the subordinate to the MPS other but usually life is used in life is these guys are employing those people so very clearly I think the educational system also needs relook Itni sari hall people need to take a I am not saying I am not talking about boiling the ocean but I am seeing as an individual I think today for a young person feels thatI am going to attend the MBA coronavirus can I take about it will I learn over there I'll do some staff will also do in organised programs in my college I'll also participate in some concert I'll also organised some NGO activity and I worked in the slums with something that a person is going to grow up to be a far more well-rounded person he will know how to work with different environment different kind of people if you get used to sayingI need all bases in my team to win only then I can win that's an artificial happen real life in real life we are not forget it in real life you get all sorts of people you'll get people were intelligent you get people are not intelligent you get people have intelligence in one area and not in another area you get people were passionate people are not passionate people were hungry not hungry will get the card that you get dealt with and the ability to play with cards which are not like youusually only come if you have had some of that experience but we have been always a topper in school always win then I will to the college and then you'll and into the real world it might at I have usually found people were done extreme again and talking generally done extremely well and academic very rarely take risks because they were perfect tracker got first division II first gold medal is gold medalist good he or she will never take something with is a chance ofbecause it will spoil their record those people will very rarely take risks and because they will take very rarely will they take reasonable not deviate from the beaten path and the beaten path is the beaten path with very little aur very less return you want higher returns you have to take a path which is not be Tum I know you have to take that path and to take that part usually there is a saying that poolesville deep where Angels fear to tread and an extreme example what are usually found that if you are to do something remarkably differentit does take a person who is not in the standard format of education and thinking to do that since you had leadership experience in the army and then in the corporate world something like cool your told me about the army the last episode was that the training in was a slight shift in your mind set to be able to work as a team to be able to have some old leadership qualities in each person so when you doing that switch into leading in the corporate world in your findloose screws in your finding the people want train that same manner that the army people attend what were your discoveries about non Army human beings like what are they think this question needs to be taken in some sort of a death because I can give a Shallow answer with their Armies different private sectors different challenges of different on a veryenvironment for different way completely different and understand firstly that lets say you and I if you're working the army together in 6 months time you and I will know everything about each other for the simple reason we are spending 24 by 7 together except when you are only way I am on leave the rest of the time we are together missing the options match your growing up I am in your Paltan you are no way avoiding me so you better final scene you better find a way to work with me whatever it is a corporate you have a set period of timewhen you are 925 your working after that even the world what is happening in your world what is happening in the unknown to me maybe once in a year I will meet in some festival of some brazing day or founders day or something but other than that it's very difficult to really know the real you s i know your CV story I don't know your real story have no idea about your real story have the other story ever told me in your CV and your CV stories obviously an ample story all of our ACB stories I am Play Storethere's a top Mein Aaya kya hota hai iska Sahi Hota uska the time where you go betrayed by you betrayed people where you have not been in your own eyes you are not done the right thing and all that this only a real friend will never happens in the army that is the kind of camaraderie between physically or together you are you friend you in some places you know each other body order you are in the same for 3 months 6 months together so you know each and every idiosyncrasy of the person and you also learn thatby and large people are people will be some part with the good some part will be bad there is no such thing as a good person or a bad person has some extreme example but by and large people will have good things and bad things and all that you start accepting your teammates for who they are and not for what they see we says they are so that one big difference the other is that there is some sort of the parity everybody captain with a certain number of service and you are a captain with the setsalaries are going to be dictated by government of India it doesn't matter Jackson whether you outperform me 10 times you are not forget the performance bonus which is higher show at the economic level there is a paragraph course there are the measures of reward is promotion there is plum posting is there are many foreign tours and all that which are another mechanism silver but financially there is not a parrot easy not very often found in this true story this is actually happened to me I remember when I wasthe company is I was just you and I synergize the annual appraisal came to me via the whole chat and all that and I said OK job well done and I gave him his Envelope for the next year salary and opened it and I was delighted because he got a race that he was not accepting expecting and even though I was thinking but not this much and all thatUske Ghar Se Tera Ghar Mera Chain aata hai kya Uske ghar mein Paisa aata hai use Tere Ghar Mein happy with what is bot in an absolute sense but when compared with the relative sense there is a certain order so yes those levers are very different in India me on the government for that matter that he was a different but I think there are some essentials of leadership which are common and I think those essentials of leadership are possiblypronounced in the army for the simple reason that you are on duty all the time you are for example I could work in a corporate address making up the good work in a corporate and say come to the corporate at 9 o'clock in the morning and 5 o'clock leave no really knows who I am after 5 to next day 9 in the morning and I could be I could be drunk I could be in abusive person I could be whatever in the army or a good fit for your lovethe troops that was watching you all the time so there is no way that you will have to be who you are and that's ok ok with Lord leaders they are not ok with hypocritical leader that's true in every place in every place people will accept of Lord leader theek hai ab main thodi bahut galti aaya but overall I will never accept the person who puts up of acid and actually is something else which I think there is a lot more scope to do in the corporate world because there are these two words so that is itmost possible to do that maintain one not for long obviously you can do this forever but these are some differences but I think the main essence where I would say leadership when is distilled down weather is leadership in the army whether its leadership in a religious institution in a school in a slum in an NGO in in a charitable institution in anywhere some aspects havecommon in the first aspect is a leader has to genuinely cared for the troops genuinely care I am not saying mollycoddle the Troops and not even saying that we had to be in a nice like cup printing at of parents genuinely cares about them a bit 100 wrong decision and order betting that could be possible that a parent in his or her wisdom in the knowledge you have to study engineering and maybe the strong decision but there's no doubting that he has the Welfare of the child in mind so I think that the first criteria that the leadersintention of being looking after the interest of the troops first is got to be very very clear if that is not there whether the army the corporate world every where people recognise is watching out for himself and he doesn't give injection and unfortunately not just in the corporate but in many many segments of life bulk of the leaders are like that it is a site and I'm not making and even pretending that I am not onenot making any judgement on that but usually will find that the number of leaders who genuinely care genuinely care are few and that's why we only a few reach that strategic level that's point number 1 number 2 I think leaders have to be constantly learners have to constantly keep learning again that is true in the army that is true in the corporate that is true in any successful leadership aspect you have to constantly be learning to be able to ask the rightyour do you to ask the right questions on bye-bye can we do it this way why we not do it this way I can tell you this time and I worked with some of the leaders names mentioned also a little while ago and I can tell you they find the time to learn and and and Saina produces I don't have the time you can be sure that the Mukesh Ambani your weekend busier than a Bill Gates son you are aware of this that each one of these leaders have their own way of constantly learning and updating the othercan a person who is a chemical engineer going to raise a telcom which meets every other telcom at its game that you can't you cancel just hire good dialogue cost you can hire the best Telecom people in the world but so can you competition so what gives you that age that you are able to do it it's the ability to learn an entirely different domain in a very Rapid time so you have to be a constant for the third thing is you also have to be very good teacher communication I want just a communication address a teacher anddifference between the two huge difference between the two at why we should not confuse the two a good communicator can communicate very well but may teach nothing may choose to teach nothing a good teacher might actually let an order go but allow the subordinate to learn something I'll give you an example of this is one Mysore zoo taught me this lesson and I think is one of the finest lessons I've learnt in how to teach and how to mentor he was a commanding officer remindMajumdar and I still remember exactly frozen in my head for the general coming for a briefing very very important man coming for a very very senior officer coming for a briefing and he certainly looked at me and I very junior person that point and said ok you are going to conduct the house palpitating and other reversing and as practicing and this and that in this going to come and the time is also shot and I like a new Pizza Gadbad explored in this and that and all that and I am literally a personBadi dost I went through the whole thing and just before the presentation is going to start the syndicated to Mizoram and he started the present the hell did you do that shit but that was the mentorship he actually put me through the palpitations which is going to happen in a high-risk presentation without actually taking the risk of doing that so he made me go through the entire battle inoculation without the actual battle so the next time I had to do it I would be prepared for itadjusted to the not to do it all better then I'll do the presentation will help me in which case I switch off completely because if you want to do it why should I get enquiry Kesar Ka Gadha gadhe pointer Laga Diya but beyond that I am not invested in it but the movement is shifted it to me I became invested in IT personally and use that opportunity to train me on that this is a technique I have followed throughout my career in every meeting that I'll go I'll take one or two youngsters with me for two reasons one is that they statuson the wall and see what happens in this predictable what what are the kind of discussion that I'd answer that they don't have this of an ivory tower Pathani vahan per Kaun look better kya sochte who is that there was a human being they also have feelings they also don't understand many things and know that that goes away the second is I will usually tell them that they listen I am in ask you to take on a point that help them prepare and sometimes of one of the most is that it doesn't hold good so I'll ask them once in a while now these kind ofmix are also techniques of teaching teaching doesn't just mean I can stand and do a brilliant lecture teaching means how do I find opportunities where I can allow my colleagues are my peers to experience that learning by way of example of undo this that whenever I am going to higher studies I will ask three or four people to interview that person and another person OK what is your situationEk Aur not take if so yes why not why now what is happening is that person's riga is being applied right she is applying the trigger is applying the river I am also getting into the brain and thinking of that individual will tell you had in my last you send any person to him for an interview is a fabulous that the nature of the personone source is very good have to calibrated and bring it down if is a 9.3 of to bring it down to about 6 or 7 because you'll always over grade similarly the may be somebody was extremely Sainik or you may have extremely you know local views about something many have a colleague who was a view that women can't work late so if this job requires late working a Raipur for a man not this in the minds of the person has it's important for you to know that myit's important for you to know what is the mindset of this person now you can do a quiz on that person know if I'm batao Tumhara Mein so how do you do that you do this by creating opportunities where you are able to observe that person's behaviour and you say OK when we use but given the situation this is the way the person reacts to that situation that also allows you to understand that person much better and understand that person thinking much better if person a comes back and say that was a fantastic presentation is located must be good in time in excellentperson become the total crude is probably gone good but by his calibration he will always given very important to understand that because eventually for a strategically the you have to use the eyes and Minds of other people to make your decision and eyes and Minds of the people and never objective were always subject they always had a narrative of that individual prostitusi the same roche pictureab so you know that inkblot test open the test for administering the five people 5 people will see 5 different stories that does not the picture the stories in the head the picture is only the trigger so if you have to lead Anjali who are you leading everything about as a leader who are you like leading the physical form of A and B are you leading his legs and his arms and is just are you living in mind reading is mind then you have to know the mind and your mind is very different from his mind very different your mind is very differentyesterday your mind is very different and depression your mind is very different in a creative task vs mechanical task there are some people who will check the hundred the line of the Excel sheet with the same diligence as the first line there are some people after the third line will get if you don't know whom to assign what task even if you have a great team United start messing up I think that is what I mean by teaching leaderleader is always trying to impart whatever knowledge they have to their ecosystem again with a very selfie everything a gain of an altruistic were none of this stuff that I am telling use from an altruistic is from a point of view of becoming a better leader because if you understand how a person is behaving and you are able to impart what you know or what you think in that situation to that person then you are actually force multiplier your capabilitybundu idhar of this you don't teach you visit a ok bye not select this guy why but I like this that person has no idea of where she went wrong what can be recalibrated where is the alignment mismatch at the Palazzo I'll go back to the three fundamentals genuine genuine interest in the teams that you leading that they must do well and that they must doing well is not necessary to give the reason the salary it could just be a member in Relianceembarked on a program which was basically to make sure that every officer who was working in that group the that knowledge level was announced that they would become better people in terms of general education general knowledge better communicators had an internal exam in Reliance call the capsid the career accelerated program which anybody after 4 years of 3 as a service can write an it puts on an accelerated track and this whole initiative of littlepeople we have to give you have to and the number of people who declared that it shows you the Talent was already there it just needed that stimuli and that the job of a leader job of a leader is to provide that stimuli that compares and individual to go beyond limits that has been imposed by themselves using that in Limited been imposed by the people told you are in this good enough for youbut if you actually compel them to try and attempt which is much bigger than they actually make it it your building their confidence new building better you're building a better version of that person which I think is the primary job of every leader second as I told you have to be running constantly you are to be constantly learning which can be Technology can be new concept that can be a different way like the podcast that you have a watch that I am not connect with that what I need to watch it why does it have 4 million views so what is it thatis attracting this form is for million people and why are they listening to this and what am I missing out of that you can Badi bakwas I don't like it with bakwas is not it is good for million views which has twice the number of views that anyone who might boxes got then very clearly either they have some formula for some odd even say something that I need to learn from the last point is that if you're constantly keep teaching 1 it reinforces the knowledge in your own head secondly you aremore and rich team and your building also a very vibrant culture where people share their knowledge and their knowledge creation then create you train them like this for 20 years and one day you tell them collaborate and trained to hold knowledge inside themthree trades I found our common this good leaders have it in Bureaucracy the avett in Army they have it in its the evidence supports the greatest leaders in sports actually make the players train much better than them running zone is a great example when he is there in the field everyone feels that I can operate at my very best some other captain May actually bring a sense of fear into the anybody very famous statement madewho is a powerful leader a powerful leader is one in whose room when you enter and come out you feel powerful you feel energetic powerless leader is one in whom you go your scared and you come out your like half of what you were earlier so the idea of power is different a powerful leader is one who gives people the feeling that they have become more powerful a powerless leader takes away That Power from people a lot to think it's the other way arounddar lagta hai to a powerful leader Hoga Nahin Hua powerless leader hai agar aap dar lagta hai uske office mein jaane se ghabrahat ho Kitni kya Sawal Puche ka yuddh pooch lega Tumhen kya jawab Dunga Dahisar powerless likha Badi you feel ke Hath Par Naam aata hai bich Mein but dekhne ko Milega will take me to the next level will will generally watch out for my interest then that is a powerful I think that these three train time from common across all the three domains that I've worked andCena the people coming back to your story you had one very interesting evolution right after I think your Mahindra sprint and your initial Corporation I will your corporate career divided into two parts in the middle of that you work to the government also on a project file no you can't talk about it too much on a public podcast like this but involve a capacitor work and I'd love to hear it from your mouth to share it with my listeners and all even if you can't say what you did exactly if you take some learnings from dust into your life24 I can't share what I did there will still it's in the interest of us as a country it's not and it's not really important what I did there what is more important is that I think for a country like India we must start understanding the concept of soil let me take a project like Aadhar which is more portable and it happened at the same time and I was quite involved in that also and of coursewho was sitting at that point of time was also can a comment or in many other ways so we have to as a country start looking at leveraging on national capacity not government capacity not private sector capacity but national national capacity mean to National capacity is the government the private sector the citizens individuals all working together towards the same mission because increasingly problems of our country are going to beflex and multidimensional and multi-stakeholder for instance to understand politicians dilemma let se political leaders dynamic suppose you are asked how do you improve the health of a country like India there is no one single trustline you do we need more Doctors of course in it more doctor manasella ninnade Moha Sabari also need hygiene you also need to clean sewage disposal you also need clean air you need to give education to mothers to have the proper nutrition you need took listen to the baby is you need to make sure that there is a post delivery care this thing you have to be early so it is a multifunctional and multi-stakeholder activity which has to work in conjunction with each other just by providing more doctors in all the problem like we realise in Kuwait just by providing ventilators how are you can make for the shortfall of the doctors for short follow the doctors will go to go back 15 years to train a doctor having has 5 years experience then intense than otheryou send me realise that when you are trying to solve National problems you need to leverage National capacity and other national capacity can come from various different segments matter of fact most complex problems in the world weather is The Taming of the atom the Manhattan Project or even a major major things that nations are done it has happened as a collaboration between several entities which included the government the private sector or private citizens they all work together but fortunatelyunfortunately we cannot look at it in countries like the US the UK Europe this has already been done several times during the first and the second world war in the Second World War or in the case of us even in Vietnam is a very common thing for a lot of the military who worked in the military to come into the corporate world and then worked in the corporate world and then come to decision point where they have to take a decision on the military and they have an understanding because they been there so lot of the European leaders orAmerican leaders corporate leaders have had a stint in the forces in the area the case that I am so they understand that government private partnerships are not the adversarial in India to a certain extent they are still adversary it seen as a private sector guard me a Sarkar Academy so there is that almost like a Chinese war between these two entities and for whatever reason valid reasons on both sides made in the government things that in a lot of peoplecorporate sector Aakar after that could be a thinking a lot of people the corporation the thing a government Walekum Nahin karte hain De very lethargic and if you look at their as a working and more importantly their responsibility it is an animal Amin incompatible because if you are working in the private sector Industries grew up in a job you do the same thing and the government the CBI Court come after you because they may say that this clear cut intentional sotheir working environment in which they are working is very different now I think both these words need to understand and work together because if any Nation has to look at solving Complex problems they actually runs a session with CF force and she put them into three different groups and she says ok you are all bureaucrats and government servant and you are NGOs and activistwhat the property is demography what do you think about the government is thing about the private sector is there already always capless money is the only one month and make more money you get the money licence will try to make profitability of it if you don't regulate the prices they will show the prices of medicines aap NJ bopla Dunga yuasa corporate people they say Kuchh Canadian licence Raj for everything you need permission is ka permission uska permission to open a business unit 200 permission this that they have no understanding of our business they don't understandBalaji airport from rule which will be completely NGO activities they don't allow any project to start then nothing to start this that now is the same group of people the same group of shear force when the way ahead of the other side they have an adversarial relationship but guess what for any project to happen if you want to increase jobs in Maharashtra you need to provide maybe Airport newport has to come if you build up pot that will provide jobs to 10,000 people will also may be killed 10000that's all really Turtles die they are the precursor of the nature getting destroyed so that was upon this is also important to realise that in a country like India you are always going to have a solution which is a satus satisficing solution it is satisfactory and efficient it is never going to be super efficient on a scale of 1 to 10 you'll never is like designing a menu for 100 people nobody will be satisfied more than 60% non vegmeet Jyada nahin tha Agar bahut jyada Meetha Meetha Nahin everyone will have a 6 out of 10 rating and that's the best thing you can do in a complex country and a complex problem the ability to leverage National capacity is something that I think India should really really work at an accelerated platform and there is some very basic reasons for the reasons for it is that when the answering a very simple exam simplifying the example but I think it'sthe portlet se the civil services in 1990 decided that we need Hundred and Fifty IAS officers because these are the portfolios 1992 not visualised that you'll need Creative arts you'll need internet traffic monitoring you need this that there's no way to even in Visarjan vacancy that will be required now if you have to position someone that we can see you need that demonstrate you have to bring that person lately that you cannot you cannot tell a person who is winner IAS officerAnnelida is a General officer what is doesn't understand that particular domain of that particular Technologies writing this interweaving of national capacity is something that a country like India should really embark on as a program in every government it has been attempted it has been attempted and like many of such projects it starts and then it had some success and then it but I think this is an area that we that wasthe biggest learning that we do more of it get one we should do not only more of it we should have a much much better understanding of each other's lives and you know for a man I never had that motion in my head because I have worked with the government in my previous corporate of that also work with MHA very closely area and with but for all my friends who opens comment that you know I don't work with the Gandhi Ghatit is such a sweeping inaccurate statement still tell people about my first day in MHA when I joined the time Mr Gopal pahle was the home secretary and Sofia the first day at join us feeling on the paper is that all of those things are not sitting in the waiting room and I sat there and it was like 7 o'clock then it was 7:30 is and it was 8 o'clock I didn't know what to do it was my first day so I can ask the PS of the homethat any instructions for me or outside your sitting I just check with the home secretary in matlab code to immediately the home secretary call me inside you are still sitting and I said I do not know what to do if I was sitting here you go and come back tomorrow morning when will start at the moment so by the time it was about 9 o'clock so I just asked him very casually I said this is the normal working time till 9 o'clock in no no no no no only when there is a crisisgoing out of the room again called out and he said in the home ministry everyday is a crisis that when you realise that people who work under government constraints they are actually it's like putting a string it's not like pulling a string that so many processes that have to be a deer to because its public money because there is compliance because it's not Seth ki company that you know somebody can write offI think once you understand the constraints in which someone is working you will be far more appreciated that the progress has been made in that space that doesn't absorb people in this field that field that field war Circus were corrupt and not talking that I am saying this understanding of each other's domains and understanding of each other they are coming from at a and during my tenure in net grade I may have had veryVivah serial relationship with one or two of my colleagues with one click I remember we had was a relationship but what that man taught me about even the basics of something as rudimentary as Vastu and what are the deep scientific Principle behind it or his ability to grast extraordinarily Complex things in a fraction of time which and a new benchmark for me in terms of learning is your learning that you take away from from different domestic milehas been that if we have to solve Complex problems National problems a very complex they are not one order of thinking that I 18 orders of Thinking are Karunga to uska Sar Hoga uska Sar Hoga uska Sar intense collaboration from different stakeholders who cannot afford to be adversarial because the problem that you are trying to solve is much much bigger than our adversaries and my mat are you ok explainingwhat the Madrid is but it in words that can be understood by a 10 year old so I can explain it to you from Public Information whatever is there in the public information that it's there on Wikipedia to tell you think of that institution as a library catalogue a library catalogue so let's say you are a student of history and you want to you want a book on your knowledge on Ancient History of Indiaare you go to this catalogue so the library in the first ask you ancient history of India is too big when you tell us from the Gupta period ok fine Gupta Period there are four books that I will return 81 is in the Bangalore library one is Mumbai University one is a private collection with somebody and one is over here this is the gist of the content at your seniority you are authorised to see only these things and if you want the book the book is with them will make the connection happen so this is in a nutshell what anyfashion exchange system is supposed to do you just supposed to redirect the information seeking query to the right place where it is and of course also in some cases to Fuse the data together to take data from two or three areas and to make the sharing of data I want to call it intelligent data much easier so this is the charter of much every fusion centre in the world not just that great every fusion centre in the world this is theto Charter to help pick out a needle in a haystack of needles the purpose of it is to better what aspect of the national security National and very specifically oriented towards contractor at least this was my knowledge six years ago and of course after 6 years I have no knowledge of and and Institutions involved the change the gender DNA that changed their motive mandates and I think that's what itmetro from working with the government can ask you very direct question to bring you back to the corporate side of things what did Mr Mukesh Ambani see a new and think they're ok I need this person to ask that your point of view that I am Mukesh bhai for many years and non am from the time when I stood back to the Mahendra group I've always admired certain qualities in a and when I leftthe government as an individual is the kind of person who like Anand has I think he knows his mind when he wants a certain kind of a talent to come into the family what do you learn about in the after you met him then what's the difference between your version of him before you met him was the first when you work with the leader closely and the and I don't pretend that I was in ainner circle or anything of that sort but the portfolio I held was sufficiently sensitive for me to be able to observe him from very closely and I think I'm not just him but I would say his father because a lot of things that you see in that Empire are the foundation is late by the father and of course he has taken it to another level altogether but I think if I were to pick one quality in Amazon leader or as a individual Asuscredible ability to envision things way way ahead of the rest of us I often quote this incident is more of an internal incident and I am getting it here because I rotate in my favell mail when I was living I wrote this incident as one of my experiences that I had with him so I am in the early days had join at that point of time we had I think Reliance as a corporateplease the owner and custodians of the largest number of cctv cameras in the corporate world definitely and how many millions we probably have because every store every refinery every location is pipelines all these things so this is that time and rules were starting to come in and was talk of using drones for aerial surveillance and in a user can do with hundreds ofone room with customers are saying that so I put together some plans and I remember going to his office to discuss that with a man in a talking to him over the drones and other as a big and telling about drones and I know this is why we are doing it to replace the cameras Bala all of that he was is a 1 minute 1 minute and you started amazing in his desk somewhere and from below is selfie pulled out a sheet of paper any name the person who doesn't reallyis a person from blackstone one of these financial companies and he said that he was your last week and it is satellite Creed altair by a satellite not coming from any other business leader I would take that The Pinch of salt but from him it's quite possible so when I was thinking that I am thinking at a macro view of instead of cctv camera and thinking of a dronemeaning of satellite I think that distance very clearly this distance shows that one unique trade it has the ability to envision something which is so huge and so large that the rest of us may not even think in Indore mein that I think is A Remarkable trait and I think every country needs a few of such Leaders because it's these leaders who are able to Pole Vault and and take away the digital revolution in India todayevery person having access to at least content in open the content can be cracked that's not His fault or teapot and I am sure the content will now feel in that space but access to content I think has been exceptional it it is it is it something that lega said when history of India is written this period when suddenly overnight everyone got access to unfettered access to tons ofyes I think it is it will be a huge contribution to every Indian and every next generation I think that's choose the important for all the youtubers life is also youtubers life but you now and I am fashion and you are one of the examples but like when I see some women sitting somewhere in Bhopal and has 6 million followers when she teaches how to stitch a blouse and just thinking of the relevant that Women must have had in a life in this monthhow to stitch a blouse and suddenly everything she became a celebrity but she became relevant she she is now an entity and identity on our own for you perhaps it's not that big difference you are born in the right place right family even if you do not have YouTube access your not a youtuber you still would have had the elements but the ability to take a person who is sitting on the back of Beyond Kashmir and for some remote area and Northeastern I'm there is able toconnectivity get me wrong example in current times but in the Northeast on the remote areas and have the same amount of connectivity that a city kid has a similar to that extent I think that's Revolution people haven't really grast even now that I think you ok Sabko YouTube Mil Gaya is not duty Mil Gai you got you got access to resources which was only for a privileged few he has it the right way to put it is she hasmystery in the future is actually mainstream the future is made the future Main Street and think that definitely is something which sets him apart from many other leaders have worked with them seen also very closely what about the whole organisation I mean if you work across corporates what is on a very foundation and cultural level what has allowed Reliance to break out from the rest of the back because I am sure there is aambition among the rest of a package well but there must be something culturally correct done here to allow the rocket launch frankly I don't think I am qualified to comment on the question that day I think every company every organisation has their own culture they have their own DNA they have their own operating system and they have their own way of operating within the larger operating system so this 45 parameterdefine every organisations path and of course organisation also like human beings have a lifetime just like human beings they are born just like human being they have a young age like human beings and adolescence their maturity and unfortunately like human being to become old and when they become old that to become a writer can therefore should I I I won't take any particular example balance talk aboutrecent phenomenon that we've all seen that a company called zoom comes out of Nowhere and overtake Sky WhatsApp phase space time she is time Cisco WebEx Google Hangout all of them and what exam to become 100 billion dollar valuation why does enough doesn't Facebook know FaceTime doesn't WhatsApp know how to do video conferencing doesn't WebEx Cisco which had the original telepresence don't know how to do thatwhy were they not able to leverage so it's also where the company is in its origin in time in terms of is agility in terms of its flexibility in terms of its eyes so many things come into Play Store to take any one aspect and say that this aspect is what made this company happen is a wrong thing to do because it is inaccurate it's always a combination of factors be just because company a did it company be may not be able to do it because that's the company's core competence company behan may not have thatstopping may not be done that way company if the culture of a company is having one centralised command and subservient leaders that they staffing is done that way the aspiration of the leaders is validation from that Central source where is another company may have a requirement of having multiple leaders let's take a company like Pepsico multiple brands and multiple franchises that need multiple independentdoes stopping will be done in a very different way there the reward mechanism is not necessarily a pat on the back from the main person at top but part of the back from the market over so it's unfair or incorrect diagnosis like your Physical health you can't describe the same diet to two different people and say what works for a Olympic athlete an Olympic athlete consumed 8000 calories a day you do that you will explode in 8 days so it is basically what works for a certain entityI think that group for Mahindra aur Billa aur Tata any one of these groups have found that ideal combination which works for them which works for their partners which also works for the expectation of the second a stakeholder will expect certain things from a certain company or a certain brand they will not expect the same things from another company and another brand so the brand and the company are meeting the promise it doesn't mean they have to be exactly the sameI will not be the same will be very different but each one will find success in their own way but at its core accompanying is a collection of people so one thing I've seen it is from the outside and have been a part of like the Reliance Group of people with my schooling was at the Dhirubhai Ambani International School there is an element of the Reliance culture given in the school the way I look at it I think it's very person oriented as and like a lot of people are elevated to positions ofcommand and I also feel that this is a deep family culture you also see that in things like Mumbai Indians ki pretraining like the old guard so that their reward long-term players within the organisation is a some kind of cultural thing from people leadership respect I'll answer this question and different let's say you have a driver who is driving capability in a scale of 1 to 10is 7 but his trustworthiness is in a scale of 1 to 10 9 another driver you have his driving skills in a scale of 1 to 10 is a 9 but trustworthiness in other than driving because I just joined you is maybe three or four you have to task 1 task is that you have to rush to the airport to catch a flight and it's really really critical thathow to catch the flight that case you need to send 500000 Singh cash to your friend in Mumbai or win punav desperately needs how are you can make the selection right now to deliver the cash you will take a person whose driving skills maybe 7 but trustworthiness 9 so 729 is equal to 6363 in the other case the persons driving skill is nicetrustworthiness 44129 is equal to so when it's a choice between 63 and 36 the choice is very kya so any leader would rather have a person who they trust who they feel aligns with them and is competent enough to do the job than to have competence which is very high but alignment and trust may not be that I now both for alignment andtime is a factor because there is no way I can come and tell you sir trust me I am a very trustworthy person I have to be with you for a certain number of years before that trustworthiness you accept I'm still a trustworthy person I maybe hundred percent trustworthy but for you to feel that comfort that yes I can trust is a different ballgame and therefore in certain organisations weather is reliance or any other organisation which are much more familyoriented which are much more people oriented and is a very people oriented organisation I think the way they go out of the wave somebody Falls ill even during this covid-19 their lifted doctors from all over the world to make sure that every place and that kind of interpersonal you know kind of people care apna family apna hi apna aadami hai to that is a very different from antiseptic MNC kind of behaviourwhere you are just dineout Si grade pay grade 24 that it and maybe you are few clicks but you are never ever there is no such thing as a family in induction different different requirement different kind of people one is not better than the other just different it is like saying Gujarati Thali in Maharashtrian Thali which is better that completely different and I think we have to understand that so that is definitely one of theirthe day you always have to look at the outcome I think and organisations efficiency as to be measured by the outcome a company that is outperforming the market a company that is growing your own your outcome it does show that it is doing the right thing something that being done right that is the way to look at it I got my answer answer all my corporate quiz rounds and all my story based questions I got talk to you about life and the future and this is coming from all the perspectivesaur Army Tenu truck operator your plus I feel you always been at that stage where you been alone is even more features for you the process of learning as you grown and I am saying that replace of knowing you behind the camera as well as reading and all that so what do the next 20 years old and I know that you think of black the present more than you think of the future but still fat ask you what would give you joy over the next 20 yearshow do you answer that after a carrying a few little difficult to understand I wish I knew the answer to the question I genuinely wish I knew the answer to that question and there are two reasons for that one reason is my life has been this is not my career in my my life I think as stated in the first quarter podcast also I don't think I've ever had this structured view of life and life is to somebody to ask me how did this all happened I'll say it was a lot of serendipity lot of being at the right place at the right time for blood ofgood Karma by other people whatever you call it it's been there and into a certain extent I believe this is my believe I'm not asking anyone else to believe it but I believe that the check marks that a person should have at least in the professional side I have a sense that most of the checkmarx I have done it admin to my satisfaction I've done a lot of young men especially I can't speak for women with are not a woman myself but for a lot of young men having this professionbecomes the game you create for your its digits of this is that hole theory of an external scorecard versus internal scorecard so an external scorecard is handed over to you when you are born for women when you are born for you if you could do this school is good if you get science after 10th is good in Science if you get into a Medical College of Engineering College is good if you get selected by the big 4 in your first this thing in your first day of placement is good if you are given a dollar paid job in homeis better than being paid rupee paid job in Pune that's good so you constantly being told that this is good and therefore you should be happy and that's may be true for an external scorecard but some point in time you'll arrive at life at some where you live and then you can I get at various stages also very very nice that I don't really feel good just because I have this I mean you are saying is good you are saying is good you are saying it would look like if this story many many years agowhen I was a kid as a family outing we are going to a place in Karol Bagh and in Karol Bagh very famous kulfi shop at that Kulfi Wilson said that metal Innova stick and it is very famous shop so people come there from there everyone I was their first time having a Kulfi and told that this is a delicacy and all that now what happened is your way at this as they put the Kulfi they also put salt in the eyes so in this particular thing there was someDil Ka issue was full of salt so when I was eating a completely salty and everyone is this is tested it and she told that and that was astounded use of sound heard that I eat like 70% of it I said sab log I thought it was good in life we of one it feels like that no bigul others have told us it is good so we eat it and ministrymight must be good if I am in working for this means if I am having so many likes it must be good and not so sure that that scorecard you want to run with the rest of your life as you need to run with it for a certain point of time because you need the financial security you need to bring up your family educate you kill them all that when you come to a point where this extends scorecard is continuously driving you and your starting dose fundamental questions that is this the scorecard which ismy scorecard original scorecard which has been given to me by my parents by my colleagues by my friends by others and if it is there scorecard then I am I living my hundred percent like so it's a very interesting and knowledge it lets say a person who loves you most in the world are given let's make it your mother in outside easier to imagine that my mother would even the person you love the most in the world has only 20% On The Mind sure you will find a persongift for your other siblings 20% for husband 20% for her only problem I love you the most in the world has only 20% mantra for you why the hell would you leave your 100% of your life for that 20% somewhere people need to calibrate that scorecard and again as I don't think sage young students MBA students who got a very lucrative career ahead of them but using to join NGO nursing in our time and workmy scorecard I find happiness day I see that a lot happening in the current generation I don't think our generation or at least at that point of time that financial Street I had that luxury do SE care do it was very very fix that you are to you are to start working by a certain period of time so I think this understanding the difference between an external and internal scorecard is the first transition that I think I am going through right nowsecondly if I look back at my life I always say that I have always had a posting order come to me it's almost like the army oneday postmortem will arrive in the mail and say you are not posted two sons of place and that's the way my life has been so if somebody asks me in 1993 and never imagined that I would be out of the army is somebody asks me 19067 ever imagine that I am go back into the government has been 2013only because I think this posting orders life has a tendency to send them to you once in a while and while you wait for the posting order you wait and holding pattern and holding pattern you basically try and acquire skills and knowledge knowledge and even points of view which you may not have had earlier Roma not had the need to have a nice and I guess that's why I am right so I wouldI mean I could I open joke about it that if you asked me where I was going to be three years from now and give me 15 options what would eventually happen would be hundred and eighteen I have no idea so but like I said that the good part is to focus on your battery drill so it doesn't really matter then which battery Auto fight if you battle drills are good and by and large role in find your way out of that so I guess that's why it is it is a very longhappened to you did you know covid-19 happened no has a very very long time I say that long-term planning now a days should be about 18 months to 2 years baby Long Term plan just just so that the US get some contacts on the spot ka satavan add one story of mine we actually two years by using of stopping English Channel completely becoming extremely difficult to balance Hindi channel as well as in English and iceMai ko team like my original team and I told them and this is what I want to do anything I should go hammer and tongs on the mask am not the classical there was the easiest form of content you can do and call smart people just talk to them and that is why the podcast started a business that because it was extremely easy to do now 211 your in one half used in this is the fuel of my life and we started Hindi pot message become the main source of convent well known as the Moment vodkajust landed of you and you know the opportunitybecause the US refused to give us a supercomputer in the seventies because they said you use it for alternate uses for military and nuclear know that we went on to become one of the leading missile development programs in the world satellite launching and all other with the Russians refused to give Sarojini Technology we still haven't been made to be a good rifle rifle pistol by so when you are denied something you have to find a way out of it and that is where engineering comes in aso any time constraint is placed it always will spawn some completely new kind of thinking a new kind of annoying that we are minimum not talking about courses abroad a lot of misery and lot of heartbreak and lot of sadness to learn people but I think the pandemic itself has altered in many ways and open the avenues for people to really look at how how to roll out their plans for the futurethat's my definition of life at age 27 that as long as you keep trying to keep learning keep gaining new perspectives lifetime of energy into the directions always meant to be l i think so true and Radhika mentioned in her talk also I think eventually it all ties up together this bricks that I laid as obstacles and in a way these obstacles opportunities bricks and stones and opportunity that you were supposed to get was taken away from you and yoursend it to some other place in the largest things is all pieces for together and maybe when you look back at this incident in my life and I remember there was a certain portfolio I was holding I don't want to name what it was during my corporate you know and I was literally a lot of organisational politics and literally compelled out of that put for you but because it was I was comethe portfolio is the reason why did something else is the reason why something else happened and is the reason why I finally went on to raise the national intelligence grid and I met that individual many years later who actually cause this I am much older person and all and I went to thank him and I genuinely want to thank you that we are not think these instancesthings that come into your life they create you for an opportunity for the ability to deliver opportunity which life will present to you it's actually very easy to look at it in the hindsight it's very easy to look in the inside and say you know that difficulty which I had the tragedy which I had the opportunity that I was over look for that thing that I missed is the reason why I am in this place todaythe problem is when you are going through it now the ability to tell yourself now that now I am going through it may be bad it may be that as it may be depression net baby mental health issues to Be Anything it is for the good secreted Centre that everything happens for the best but it is true that the trick is the ability to recognise it while you are going through better and having the dissolved it happening for a reason it will happen for a few more weeksmum and son when it tends to be a very necessary part of my ability to do something in the future if I not gone through this from are the sadness or whatever I would not have been able to do the seven I've had this and show your body from several people I've heard it from a very close friend of mine who is blind who now se losses eyesight and he says that losing my side was what enable me to see the world in a different way I can you imagine a person who has becomelost one of the most important census being able to say that but he's actually cover that journey is able to say that I think in hindsight is easy when I look back at my are you look back in your 27 years of some failure you had some heartbreak you had to say it was good I had it because because of that I have this now it is if you were to go through today how do you deal with that are you able to say can I think you're right that is really the challenge and it's nice to say that a podcast but if I were to break a leg outside to be very difficult for me to convince my sweetheartbest because during that time you are hurting and when you are hurting it's very difficult to have a perspective which is two years ahead to stop now and you are you are unwilling to be reduced by any Temptation of what this pain will bring to you as a gain 2 years from now but that is the cycle of life I think they all have a certain amount of bad luck and good luck written and that bad luck as to clear outVastu you can't avoid the final question of this podcast is not exactly what the pandemic what sort of a pandemic that I feel an entire generation is dealing with mental health issues I primarily village because of social media and hyper connectivity I don't know whether we spoke wanted in this episode of the Hindi podcast Ravi spoken words that this information which is probably increase the number of Mental Health issues especially when you come2 se 30 years over 40 years so I have you seen this from your leadership positions in corporate I think it's it's good to be one of the biggest problems that not corporate India but India will face and I'll tell you the reason why I think India will face because as we are aware India's bulk of the population is very young and it's good to be young for sometime matter of fact I think firstly we have to understand this mental health is a wrong phrase because mental health is a mother all casual phrase I don't think that the rightuse the right phrase is a psychologically and safe environment ok I think the environment that the youth and the younger kids are growing in today and even adults to selection is psychologically very unsafe explain what that means psychologically safe environment is one in which you feel you can speak your mind you feel that if you say something no one will get hurt no one will get upset and that's the environment that you need in organisations where you need creativity and Innovation and new ideasbusting you cannot have a punitive environment that if you say something wrong you be penalised if you do something wrong will be penalised ironically country to your believe this psychologically and safe state is happening because of losing connection not because of increased connection is true we have many many Facebook and YouTube and Twitter followers I think you are you million whatever but how many of them are really friends of yours denareference range maybe you be lucky any person be lucky if I forgot my friends who are really good friends what happens if subliminal e if a person walk to lose 2000 friends it's almost subliminal laws that 2,000 people don't like many more like whether your good looking or not good looking is being told by a website is being told by an advertisement to have a beach ready body to have it and do you have cancelleddo you have you know shopno these are subliminal messages without being paid into people's head and in the social I have seen it and I think it is considered this is nothing you have to say happened in advertising even hear what is happening is that constantly people are being told you are not good enough not good enough good enough your bad I'm not a good if you them and give a dog a bad name the dog will turn into a bad dogs are constantly if an individual is getting that you knoware not doing enough you not doing enough you not doing it will start actually subliminal e making that person feel guilty make that person feel underconfident and make that person and happy because if somebody tells you you are good looking you feel happy and somebody tell you you are not good looking you feel unhappy you look somewhat changed or nothing change your looks looks exactly the same it is how many people say you are good looking versus how many people have you can do nothingit is what people's opinion is about you I think we should care about people but we should not care what people think about us but unfortunately in today's world we don't care about people but we care more about what they think about us right and everything would be much about it but in our believe we are thinking that they think about us within about us all the time that happens happens to all of us you know you get 1000 likes and 23 dislikesdislike Kisne Kiya By who is the way you want to the thousand like to that 23 May have dislike you for you may have reminded him of some class believe it could be any reason for negative bias to get into that I think this generation of the only use the word mental health writing the importance of creating a psychologically safe environment at home in schools in workplaces and incomeGrounds common meeting ground if we don't address this are aware that the mental health ailments are 37% Indians are affected by the physical ailment only 17% double of Physical health and Physical health is very tangible if you break a leg a people will be kind towards you because you got a broken leg come come you sit over here they are mental health problem people are not kind towards you they are and kind towards right it is truethere and kind towards your so basically I think this is going to become one of the biggest challenges which if you don't address now and it is only good exacerbated and I have everyone message that you want to say I think even for a lot of cooperation with the ask me that how can we improve efficiency is how can we do this platform and that transition in this transformation I must be at least intervening on 6 or 7 transformations in organisation multi-crore transformation and I am reminderyou know physics tuition master we had who sometimes to police like physics chemistry to teach about to pull is likewise to grow tell him that why don't we learn Alchemy so that we can turn lead into gold and you laugh at US and we knew we are trying to police leg and he would tell us that you know this light bulb this old light bulbs that we used to have 80% of the energy that is fed into the light bulb it goes into heat and only 20% convert into lightSSB just make the 20% 40000 you would make a revolution in scientific world just now LED lights do that now similarly an organisation is going with platform Revolution transition and this and that did you know that in a gallup survey as late as 2015 they found that in an organisation typical MNC large corporate large organisations less than 20% of the employees are actively engaged 60waiting for the Chartered Bus time to looking at the clock to Kaise nikalne ka hai 20% actively supporting the company because they hate about their dislike over there if this 20% engage can just be made into 40% that organisation will have an exponential growth of 100% so this area is corporate start recognising that mental health is a direct correlation with engagement so rather thanmising workforce which I am asked to do many many times companies come to music and you optimise my workforce Optimisation what they have in mind ki jo 15 12 log kaise karen 12 log ka kam mein jo Technology Laga Ke Chale on kaise karen I think is the wrong way to look at the right way to look at it is how may be engaged those 12 people so hopefully they work output is of 24 people happiness levels of 24 people that to my mind is an area that is good to be a really interestingto work and I would actually a lot of leaders now rather than studying management theories which are based 20-30 years ago ola Management Theory is a based on the Assembly line the coaters the Bell curve which 20-30 years ago I think they should be studying psychology now and right now I am sure in school you have answered this question in some exam usually maths exam that if8 people can dig of 14 feet hole in 10 days then how many people will take to get in 4 days the correct answer to that is depend on the people totally depends on the people and the state of mind is nothing to do with 18 12 14 and the leader leader leader actually transforms the state of mind positive to negative both ways so I think that answer is the answer that we need the youth to start understanding now that people are not automotives they are not mechanical you knowcanadian people they are brothers sisters cousins somebody sons and daughters summons happy daughter on a good day seventh sad Daughter and mother Day that's the dynamic we're working with and I think this area we really need to bring to focus because one thing I have you ask me what I am good at and this is somewhat of a track record that I'm kind of I have usually had the ability to see a maired coming well before it came I when mindracers he was formed at that point of time information security was not even the radar of banks in banks did not realise I remember many many years ago when I was talking to this wiki in CIA and all this hidden was there that meeting and I said this naxals are going to become a huge problem on the back of Beyond I think our biggest threat that we're looking at which will form the Bedrock of all threadsif you have a mentally unstable environment is very easy to cause any form of instability in suicide straight start going up suicide Bomber can also go up because the guys want to commit suicide why not commit suicide by blowing himself up so I think we need to really be aware that this is one area where I think not just corporate India India should really be looking at and post the pandemic it has exacerbateduse degree as a country as medical Institutions there is not enough attention on it more importantly in India there is a stigma attached to it the moment you fascinating there was talking to a very very senior therapist who told me this that every individual every invisible from the age of 1 to 70 will have some mental health issue at least three times reply viral fever everyone gets it will get it get out ofMeri people are not able to get out that's the way it should be treated and not as some Mein Pagal Ho Gaya type of that stigma and I think this is the right time for a lot of ways to start thinking about it for two reasons one it is a big problem and second is being mainstream there is no stigma in a lot of organisation out of your mental health post covid-19 that I think this is one area which wood is the youth specially one in seven Indian is suffering from some form of Mental Health which meansone of the seven people you know maybe even including you is suffering from it the remaining six have to watch out for that one that's the only way because it could be you like I said it is not 1% could be anyone of us so I think that's one area which I really see as a challenge of Alan generate your generation it is the challenge of your your generation is in a very very psychologically se and safe environment when I was growing up was sentis my parents to read the newspaper everyday I doubt whether Shardul will encourage his daughter to read the newspaper of this right to imagine the psychological and safety that had happened and that that's one of the key areas that your generation will Mini 17 combating this problem is sharing the Ranveer show positive content that stand change the world in a happier more positive please I will do that I share your answerthank you thank you for being written episode 3 of this journey again Lots more content to be created with your readers will do that but I really appreciate all the knowledge so what is said about you getting knowledge from Deepak Jain I feel

are not spoken about on the podcast at and this is a story from my own life something I went through Sunday haven't spoken about on the Internet heros all my life at one time I was a kid release look at human presence around me and asked myself is this really all that there is some people believe that we can seehorror movies Android my life when I was a kid and so the question is there was something that we couldn't see this is a story about my own house about my own building a grew up in had a hospital on the ground floor was a family-owned hospital of mind and on the 3rd floor was where I lived I was always afraid of the darkown house in the corridor always felt like someone staring at me if I were alone in any room which was dark I always felt like there was some kind of energy with me staring at me and always go through a face like that I feel like I went to a longer face than the rest of us couldn't sleep alone till I was out 19 20 years old now back when I was 11 this one time I was sleeping next my mum myAmazon at home during that time and this is also a time in my life was getting a lot of something good sleep paralysis for anyone who's had sleep paralysis they know that this is one of the scariest things that can happen to sleep paralysis is a scientific phenomenon where basically you half wake up while you are sleeping in layman's terms when you sleeping your brain signals to yourassistant not to move at all the way for the body to protect itself basically means your body becomes paralyzed because of your mind so that if something happening in your dreams you don't move your body in reaction to that dream your body's protection mechanism what happens sometimes with people who deal with sleep paralysis is that will open the eyes and I won't be able to move the bodyI won't be able to scream but I want it won't be able to make a sound the only thing that the conscious of their own vision and in a very bad case of sleep paralysis sometimes your nightmares also become a part of that experience your brain become confused between the world of Dreams / nightmares and the world reality while I did have a lot of sleep paralysis experiences this one is thescary sleep paralysis experience my sleep paralysis would often include me waking up in my own room I opened my eyes and a shadowy figure in my room because I was in that sleep paralysis Mod I wouldn't be able to screen or react to the best defence mechanism was closing my eyes and hoping that sleep meet me again was the only escapeone time when I was sleeping next my mum I remember it started feeling something deeper than sleep paralysis felt like this shadowy creators the shadowy power was kind of training me down the bed gradually changed me up entirely I knew something was wrong and were the shadow weekly just cryabout something I don't know what they said he would like to welcome in some kind of a lady some kind of Queen getting Goosebumps as I say this is certainly solve this woman sitting on top of me pale skin acne skin tone up and have a few blisters and I Di HaiI could only see one of our eyes because her hair was covering The Other I would that be read I just staring down at me why you're sitting on top of me I couldn't even move my neck was paralyzed remove my eyes I see my mum sleeping next to me I tried screaming a name but I was paralyzed we couldn't see anything all this while sitting on top of meI could feel her weight on the top of my chest and was incompatible I felt a fingers on my body and the creepiest things I'd ever been through is just 11 years old because I grew up in a spiritual family my mum knew about my fear of Ghosts my Fear Of The Dark and she told me about a particular Mantra that made specificallyweb and spirits remember doing that moment is closing my eyes and saying that mantra for those of you wondering the mantra Om Namo Deta Hai close my eyes and I just wait on me I just realised that all I could do that moment to say the mantra after beta open myshe wasn't there any more this could be just hallucination this could be just sleep paralysis but yours this carier part 2 years later I was watching National Geographic I believe Ashok alien abductions you know how window shows they create a reenactment of real life events he createdreenactment of Japanese phenomenon what is called but even in Japanese culture is kind of a normal in excess sleep paralysis is accompanied by a which sitting on top view in that show is said that one of the theories about alien abduction is that aliens simulate the Canadian experience for some human beings docomments on the human beings but to be able to manipulate human perception the create this imagery of a woman sitting on top of the human now in that show when they were trying to create a visual representation of this phenomenon what they showed that show was exactly what I saw it felt like it was almost the same woman sameJuly staring down same here on one side seam burnt skin untidy clothes pale dead eyes not staring at you angrily just staring at you with the eyes of death nothingness I'm watching the show running of the television immediately running the my mum and cryingrecords so creeped out this is no 13 and my mum just kind of pacified means to be calm down OK then go of it I struggle to sleep alone for the next seven to eight years now eventually in life feel like I grew out of this phobia I discovered spiritual dear most of you guys know everything is spirituality while it definitely speaks aboutpetition and being a good person and karma it also speaks about the spirit world the Astral world dark energy is Demons and also speaks but how you tackle these entries as the autobiography of Yogi says when you step on the I it ceases to exist at overcome my Fear Of The Dark and of just worked on strengthening my spiritualTarak merit eating a lot at around the age of 22 23 Chasma co-founder of isomeric treated with him a lot as well after working together for 2-3 years with work out of a garage inside my building and we often Begin a day by meditating together just kind of maker edit Rumal more positive at one timemeditated at night at about 12 a.m. you always meditate in darkness for depo meditations usually meditations feel very positive this particular meditation in my head was feeling extremely dark the thing is when you meditate with someone else you kind of to share a certain energy you share experiences both a girl can sense the positivity oncity of that particular meditation session so why you meditating I definitely find something dark and that line from autobiography of a yogi get that if it's a few in the it ceases to exist I get married dating events at the don't know that I am Mantra because I went back to the memory from the time I was 11 years old and I felt like we pushed out some kind of a negative energy from that roomenvironment we go in which was my building after waking up from that meditation Aloe Vera Gel as he looked at me and the more I could say anything he said do you feel that we both felt like there was some other dark energy with us and we both posted at the other now I'm not going to name the person but I do have a friend who is considered to be cyclicthat person in every visited our office and moment came to office without visiting any other room he went to the end of the corridor it is can my building my mums room the same room I was sleeping and when that which incident that happened is right above the room and this guy went to straight up and he said that this roomlot of dark energy this room has had some kind of a demon or a ghost with let and send you get the servant meditating from the posted about this meditation makes the environment more positive now I remember getting a little freaked out I went to my grandfatherpretty much the owner of that building asked him about that particular room had been running the hospital since the 1960 but he had a lot to say about that are the building is that the word patients over that span of 50 years who said that sometimes at night they would feel woman sitting on top of the chestpatients should visit that hospital for the routine surgeries and when did the recovering in those two rooms some of them would even report that a woman is name of the hospital beds did see a flash of a really scary looking woman and it will go away all this is right under the exact spot where I had that experience as of now that hospital is defunct it's not being usedunfortunately we don't feel that kind of a negative presence that since the day my psychic friend examined that building we did Puja is celebrated her one that we were lit candles that just kinda make the environment more positive in use another reason why MBA spirituality so strongly my life I felt the presence ofkarao me when I was a child after the presence of Darkness around me when I was growing up I feel like everyone scared of the dark on my Fear Of The Dark was something deeper than just the fear of a lack of light by Fear Of The Dark was the fear of some entity that always stayed at me right from the time I was a child till the time was a teenager and alone to just feels it go with itincline push it out through the positivity of my spiritual practices as a side of myself I don't reviews on the internet but is a reason I'm fascinated by the aukat had aukat experiences many of which have not spoken board online menu which might speak about from your own words if you enjoyed this podcast make sure that comes up but this video and if you are going through any and a pocket experiencesnot the right give advice but I do believe that spiritual practices help combat the Orchid

film industry the wallpapers join you what I was divided into what they were adjusted and when I watched Infinity war there in the film that so to watch a film you tougher than you start looking like that character because of big and you also have a beard like that and your talk like him in that context and then it brings about 2 to joy and pleasure bikecollector what is a lot of what is from whether it's your a photographer whether you are an art director with your printer your returns Yolo coming together to create a one single story that want to last year for eternity whether you are not that's not be refundedMr Rana Daggubati welcome to the Ranveer show is known about partnership with for example that's something a common friend was proved govekar told me he is kind of brief me on your whole entrepreneurial side of things and what I find really cool is I don't see too many famous people really utilising their Famemaximize their business careers I do feel like one of the purposes of famous business and I also feel that because you had a business oriented family you are somewhat got the education in business from them you got the education of cinema from them but that's 2nd gen next Janu triangle really blow things are the water from the thing is true about I know that your planning for 10 years into the future of 15 years into the future they finally coolsecondly could you give brief me on this mentality like why did you did you become famous in order to pursue his business career what's what your whole mission in life with my stories give the sense of spectacle because I grew up watching films like Star Wars in others and I started learning which looks so that became my first job really I was able to fix it is a very long timesmall VFX company in Hyderabad much my first courier into the movies and after that producing a few films autistics lately so were National Award for it but didn't get a theatrical release things like that and the opportunity that was therefore the governing sense of storytelling with a director on active in today's scenarioand it was because I knew the idea of how to put together towards a producer by them so I went off to training in theatre in training in specifically to be an actor in the movies like the movies and overall you is not you don't really ever define job in it you are you do whatever you want you that kind of thing is you at that point and there was a type of cinema that I likedwould you say that point where there was a lot of talent that wasn't very interested in it so that it is a clear indication that there was a kind of cinema that was available to do and you need actors and talent will do that for sure and if I can find that opportunity they find that space I do the devil stories that will resonate in different in the same story can resonator the in a country with similar actors it happened in the past so whether it's from startingcoming to Hindi working in the Maro Dum films like that worked in both spaces were sometimes I worked in Tamil for a bit and then you got to do Gazi kotlu Bahubali things that became National property search for the kind of stories I want to tell and the actor was the only thing that got me there and consistently performing and owning characters and not yourself to you wake up to be a king one day u pic up to be a commando one day you becomepolitician that's the most engaging part of life there is only a set of actors in the director calling action and that's a moment that is away from everything that's real and everyone on that set is working towards just that one shot on that one direction so that that becomes the extreme truck so what I am where you find the artist Delhi heart and you just keep pushing yourself with peoplebecause I think I come from that understanding of a look so you ended up building a company you ended up raising money you ended up selling at it in the selling the company so there is a business involvement in all that time I also made brief investments another company that point whether it is giving or other words which are interested in but never actually run a business for at least 10 years a will only acting in films that is brand new career in Hyderabad Bombay if there is a carrier possible to beacross the country in some form and their what are you understood was constantly using AC and advancements in terms of how we are trying to tell the story there is very little being done in the description on the back into the business it will still as old as it was being conducted hundred years ago I started like how using technology to Hate Story telling you started using actuate the process of making cinema better weatherthe business of find solution binders making marketplaces using blockchain to enable content to whether its opening different channels of really being able to produce content which is just not means being but also culturally relevant that is music which is and also which is subculture as his own right so that was so that that kind of came on where the 360 side opening up so if it wasn't investwe have a company that embarks and holds all of India's mythology in one place and can really become a house which is probably much larger than what it is your anything can offer to to to anyone in India to that really was the direction of each of these investments whether it was in amarchitrakatha whether it was in partnership with himself in his underwear we created the first agency model in rable to find disrupting means to to add this is your story to be told setting to be not winner of this kind of both go hand in hand because you've got to take a few steps to make a news story work so what I get from us in your core your storyteller like and you want to be a part of the process of storytelling because in the modern day storytelling has cinema and the film industry in general attached to ityou also trying to plug holes in the film industry and at the same time ok with this business opportunity great but at its core your trying to tell stories to leave a lasting impact I know I The Way I Look At stories and especially films and acting is that you give a piece of art some amount of your time and then you become a part of that infinity and I feel like you see things that we as well and looking for a businessit is no need you to me there is no requirement to do business visa if that's not something that I am solving for the current market them that I am in awe it used to be an unlisted able to create something which is not there in the in the movies all in the weather television with its film Roti read as long as there were not have been around to INR in terms of making content so I can exactly understand what the pain points on all of these programs are whatwhat is needed for talent what is needed for studio was needed for tech like adding that's unable to connect the dots and each of these business ventures have not served one or more of those problems and pinpoint the intend to do business in his first very important especially if you want to be the creator of landscape because they both go very hand and it can't be structural or processed the way otherthis some some said that you can consistently follow this conception requirement for creators and business to go and ok completed breaking away from business how come you have this peaceful humble Vibe in Saturday use degree do like a generally I am not generalizing but people from outside the film industry would look at the Hindi film industry and point fingers say things like you know what's the world most glamorized rat race or that too much arroganceAnam Amin the YouTube words and a meeting people who are on the fringes of that industry and just the general mainstream actors mainstream directors a kind of look that with this Hawai you so arrogant Vibe original why you so angsty and I don't blame those guys I am not I am not saying there are gandu Angry but I do feel like generally actors in this country do a lot of pressure on them just because of the nature of Fame in India and ICU your soul I can send out and now is thatsouth industry thing which I am not exposed to and everyone like that in the south is it just you and you want to complete it's really wanted to meet the biggest film of the most unique film or something that stands out with each otherfind whether that's really well the competing factor is a is came from a city like Hyderabad aura city light which visor can you make a film that stand out globally receive that's really the agenda for the competition among the lot of a business in Telugu at least I can say that there is Independence Day is on independence in this one large cinema with coming all of them kind of have their space that they are taking and in fact they were also in the theatreold baby the first Industries to open back and that releases and touch control number is once again in pendrive with less of the outside that whether it's there is that surrounded with whether it's with Paparazzi with press with advertising with music a lot more happening in Bombay City to I don'tpurchase on the people in the industry and when you meet people in retail you meet people fashion within Bombay aur Hyderabad is slightly that energy be collecting Bombay city has that energy of heavy on just driving ahead and adjustedthat the driver had no right man the other the other thing I feel is especially about South Indians in general and you can't generalize South India because I know is very very done I have a lot of South Indian friend but as someone from the northern part of the country what I see in common and you know there are parallels in cricket is well UC South Indian cricketers everyone's technically gifted everyone's very craft specific that means AVN cares a lot about the UNOfind details of the job they choose to do that translates into this hold on let me give more of my mental energy to the job and doing rather than caring about all these superficial things it is that sensenew audience and your pic like three films could you recommend like 310 people should enter the Telugu film experience through and why those three specific forms today's audience referencing let's be released in the round there is a film which is Bahubali that I would show the map easily to show here goes to the space where everything is about scalewe want a film or a story to be told larger than life it's any comes from a very Indian understanding of what India is right from the heart want it if you see a Ladka stories whether there Ramayan of the Mahabharata the come with scale they come with scale they come with what they come with everything that is big to be told in terms of a lesson to be learnt something that's where our ko story telling competition at that position at showthis is a film called Pataal Bhairavi is a very old black and white film of MS NT Rama Rao because folklore was something that was opened up and Maya bazar these two films really is one film my Bazaar opens up a folktale which is written in the Mahabharata which solly prevalent to fewer areas and other then that story is not even had another place and feature film is it been made and and big stars did that if you if I would take the otherthey would win in a recent time will be recent film called alavaikuntapuramlo which Allu Arjun and Trivikram where it consists of plastic family drama holds basic values of father son understands Indian sentiments very deeply V so that will be a step whether it's that or Attarintiki Daredi yourany of the family drama film will be the sector the next one is the ratio of films like care of kancharapalem in others that are extremely small in budget made under two free throws a budget films that will touch your heart and antique few places that you want to introduce them with his various genres of films and that all of this is possible here and whatever cinema that you resin into you get toyou'll get to see a pin in volume right I will check these out and having the obvious next cliched question is if your to do the same for the Hindi film industry for south audiences who have never ever seen a Hindi film what would be a three films award the one you've seen it bungalow 3 Idiots that be the first because it encompasses how you can make such a large mainstream films with such simple drama and thehuman emotions are usually these films are you treated as small Drone of films or that have in a Retail Industry want to take a story like this but you are in the Hindi and Bollywood figured out a way to tell it in a very mainstream sense and those stories become extremely large that big fan of the show because this it touches every audience from 8 to 18 years at film with thisstated and second piece of tissue is DDL or anything that world which opens up the family drama what North Indians are at the culture of North India is what's the the music of North India WhatsApp I think all of that you can open that square of infamy drum then I would definitely show films the extreme Unicorn its film tamilrockers.az whether that is now part ofHindi film Gadar really created mainstream waves right now I feel like think it's been remade in multiple languages multiple place that that's that all the films advice management doing all those they create such as human drama across them and I think to understand culture of North India understand the sensibility of everyone is in each of their own risk and takes you into the homework homes are not sweating thatthat doesn't have to be cinema recommended again this is just a perspective is mean of your make a domain podcast but you know have you heard of the fish in the water metaphors basically like to take a fish out of water the fish realises Ocean divers in water all this time and doesn't understand the nature of water while it's normally swimming the same thing goes with human beings and culture venue in a culture you probably don't understand it was because it's normalised to you so what is not Indian culture like you know when you see it on the outside what are someaspects of according to with and which is which isI can't defend very much because I'm not the best in terms of what I've taken from each of these spaces put them in that place where is the first exposure to everything that together or vice-versa Tamil music directors sitting in along with the new Punjabi singer that happens in Bombay there be different ways people conductbut in terms of a sensibility to art of storytelling at least we pretty much operate the same if it's there is a mainstream and there is a subculture and everybody differentiates between whether you are in Hyderabad Bombay aur in Chennai there is what is mainstream and there is what is subculture and that thinline now that is kind of getting filled up with it and digital waves going Hai right that's that it is right nowabout storytelling art and culture I do feel like this is where the Indian epics come into play Ramayan Mahabharat it's the same kind of story at least the backbone of the story is the same all across India value of Modi East West North South Corridor Kyon Amar Chitra Katha you send your favourite comic book is the Hanuman comic book of Amar Chitra Katha a goal of mine and life person from an artistic standpoint is heavy watch Dragon Ball Z I want to make a MahabharatBall Z like a Dragon Ball Z style Mahabharat because I believe that the art that is shown in Dragon Ball Z it applies very well to the Mahabharata great example of a Dragon Ball Z style Indian Epic is the old Japanese version of Ramayan that they had made have you seen this wear a very beautiful hand drawn art and I do feel like children are drawn naturally to overly saturated colours this kind of largespecial effects which sometimes only come into play Through animation so are you working towards something like that I was no the animation as well because I am sure you'll have something more Bahubali style in the pipeline for yourself on a more personal level AT believe that your goal is for which we partner with Amitabh Katha but I also thinking animation or you know what the question to you is just kind of let this Amar Chitra Katha theory of mine explored in this podcast why have you partnered up with them in the first placeto consistently make content which is about Indian culture then you have to go find the place that has been making and Institute writing into culture so what is no bigger play the Amar Chitra Katha to be part of that nobody not be as to why question why was then the second thing is to be partnered with the first thing is to really scale-up films like in mythology where is the next film dawai working onas one of those properties was to create a bank of 8 which is now unique where is it has been always a classic traditional sense of what animation was there was bits and pieces of Amar Chitra Katha article that that in the past and today also you see a lot of animation which is targeted towards children and there is very little whether it's in the sense of a graphic novel or in the sense of anything that sports teamwhich is adult iterm2 consume there you go back to a nostalgic value of AC ki and its continued to stare at that 3 level but nothing at the various formats of this as much as we have things for teams that already out there 7 Nawab is to try to take a direction for how you get much younger audience into it and much older audiences that so as a company right now is provided with mythology folktale brave hearts andwith wisdom in that in that format used to kill each of them up to 60 take the directions of of actually going live action and recreating monuments and staff that used to be whether it's the barbarians whether it's Rajput go in that direction of creating number getting them either to scale on different but it is our go back and create one of our role in terms of pipeline so that's that the direction of where we see thataunty Kambi stories.com in a c k in terms of trying to take this to see that there is a enough of a Overseas audience which is Indian that consuming it and what will also doing is Creating multiple versions that I'm going to try and all all Southeast Asian languages we want to travel along with the mythology where the methodologies to visit Indonesia Balivah to stories to where they actually block and also the process of generating a bunch of story where she have a bunch of drama and from the Mauritius that Upcoming exam from early Cayman Islands upcoming news of the day gone in different places their days to take back and take a more historical roots gana devotional and religious approach to a love that idea of you taking mythology exactly where it went and then like creating for them as wellplease send True Value will see a larger Cherry to get together right in the centre of this place to go to the airport you will also be used as a journey between the day was on your stress that was the beginning of the Bhagat purana now so much visual reference is there anything that it is directing us to get there and this is the place where this storythat's what kind of hurts me about other history that start in Indian schools will own way too much about the mediaeval times the recent times about the Independence movement when there is like this glorious history that you should be learning about Prem mediaeval times for example the whole thing about Indian Dynasty is when this India was a Sone Ki Chidiya that it took Indian culture to Southeast Asia and spread as far is the Philippinesit's not spoken about enough and then you know that would the art of storytelling my do because this is that borders are gradually disappearing as the human species is evolving so a storytelling is what's really going to create the soft borders if you make sure your doing the same thing that the Chola dynasty did but in a much more 2021 contact I got back to thatRamayan question the Japanese Ramayan have you watched it because I mean I will born in 93 I believe that movie released in 9192 to check out the movie because anyone who born in the early nineties that's a reference point when it comes to Ramayan is not the TV shows its its doors cartoons that were drawn out of these gorgeous cartoon if I think of Ram everything Hanuman that pops in my head like that's my visual reference line and itsmost beautiful animated movies in that light the other thing I gotta ask you is about your whole business dealings with and blockchain and all thisfuturistic terms which possibly through a lot of people generally Amin again this is need analysing but I see a lot of people in media the in the media Industry all over India not really pay that much attention to take is very very few people it from me all the season media entrepreneurs who suddenly looked at Tekken se ovate check fits in the my business and can really disrupt shit so I have two questions for you the first is who introduced youlike this aspect of Texas oil business friends from command line through visit is it just people your meeting is it some stuff for studying and second question obviously is how do you see the next 20 years and folding for the media business because I know that you are planning to words that that everything so nowvery very basic you at to understand anything at a very very primitive level and you got any what you learn that won't load from basic and went up because Tik Tik going up with them so I was part of that curve and what I got to see whether from at different points standpoint whether it is Bahubali or other visual effects based films that it it is the easy advancement in what it did 2 picture and sound consistentlytube and then you can search and I kept travelling abroad UFC of how the business in the world cup do it and there you realise as on Amin whether it's America whether it's especially Hollywood everything is illuminated on whether it's Tech with its cinema with its media all of them in one single government in terms of and that's how the big corporations available throughout the industry which is which separatefilm and Television is separate from another great each of them in terms of best practices and start using it in the format so blockchain came in the innocence where it can't be dismayed use your face to start selling art films tools used by these and other places that are much more seamless form and then there is basically you use take to remove the middle men like in blockchain okdoing their thing that's the first pink Ek advancement rather that we did this second piece was consistent whether it's a or whether it was here or we are there been investing in a way of using content is changed the way you your relationship to a star your relationship to a movie your relationship to a Merchandise that you have from movie all that is changing as generation uski passion and now if you are born as acomedy love spells and in what should feel really like this one direction of growth if you want a gamer and you are consistently in a gaming world where is appealing as to you to you come then that becomes a generation ship to have you think and have you are you are you relate to it can't control your story teller with its flat within its 360 whether it's wrong with your in IT whether you are outside it I should be able to tell a story and check if it's a visual mediabusiness to connect with people with requires content and storytelling to be at its first ki to revise the search vote it is so great because there's so much content on it or they become platforms for granted to be there so so ultimate your these developments and advancement served in that directionpersonal goal are you are you just kind of focusing on making industry better and in the futureis to create a forever game without you consistently Bihar weather whether or not this tour is need to lead the direction and the vision to do whatever comes in the future reading that that job given bro why don't other famous people think like you like people had your level of Fame why can't they are you know thinking in the direction Ameen Ameen you you you have a pedestal of am to work out of thishaha you know what I mean by why don't why I don't other mainstream stars think this wildbecause that's been where I come from live in first m4ai run office before I got on my Rahane film set a run proper officer I think that's kind of things in excel exercises on excel sheet much faster than anything else the next section of this podcast is about life happiness and human values in general dudh before I get into the questions I just want to recommenddo you think you might enjoy it probably already seen at its sole is pics are sold on hotstar use Pokemon new generations and how they interact with contact the cal my entire generation the mental health issues generation that could be the big challenge for everyone living through the 2027 born after se 1990 dealing with a lot more mental health issues then generation Bond prior to that sober soul is one of those moviesso many questions very very beautiful what did you like about the moviethat's the beauty what picture is done over the years with many different things of that there was my favourite and then it became Inside Out and then became soulmetered film directed by the same guy I forgot his name Brian something I believe I can't members name is dene shy but again I got it could do that 3 movie question if you had to pick 3 animated movies which had an impact on you what would you suggest the ordinancesfirst I guess that's the first film II terms of cartoons with Tom and Jerry your Mickey Mouse for everyone in that world University from Kulfi together from any of the place a Pakistani I think those characters that that is a child to crop is start holding serial group of friends let you need to coverGoogle find that you want to friends to be like that so those characters can wafat so I put film and those characters all together in one and growing up I recently saw something love death and robots reason no no no Netflix you must watch it is each one is a different story and you should this one called the three words or three something like that so fun festival that it is blows you in terms ofstory telling DAV connected to any creative fieldplace that one would ever said that they chose water based business that I chose to or anything that in that manner was done on on the Knot on result but on every day's work progress and what you learn not presently we feel that I did I got to learn something far more than what I knew before and I never did beforefilm pirannavane excellent I want I learnt about it is in the 90s that I've only heard of in BITS and pieces to derive your joy from learning recreating getting people to explore to recreate time place and antique 500 people there in being able to createthe most significant thing that we can do or any other living creature is his ability to create whether it's you are able to create a path was unable to create a show doesn't matter what is but as your and the time that spent on creating is always the most joyful because it comes with no real impact write any can be hard to enter the state of flow to create of inwhether you are an art director with the European per your dancer your Lo coming together to create a one single story that will last year for eternity whether you are not that's not be there so you've answered most of the questions that I had planned out which were more specific to business and happiness and mental health and films but we got 2 Twitter questions with you so you know a lot ofSab comment actually about the opposite of happiness which is tough times dealing with Fame and especially when you are a public figure so much your life is like out there so have you had taught as for example someone called Jaya Teja asks in the pass Rana his face some health issues and maybe some issues in his relationships so keeping the movie is a side how is it possible for him to be so creative and what is the thing that keeps him pushing his onlyin terms of a professional front how do you rise from the past and what beliefs make you riseevery sense of competition between sizes never assume does competing with anybody or anything because there is a story that I was telling which is always unique and didn't matter if it cost audit rules of a cos 1 profits to me a story is a story and action and whether it's animated 30 second thought that I make or 30 hours series in goes to the same Intex if you remove the sense of financewhy you doing what you're doing it is scared to an everyday sense of it and look at each of the material that you are you got to work in as the separating return that's to me that's that that's one part of it and with that comes Fame but being famous isliye job its separate of all this is certain thing you have to do it needs to be done there are certain coaches have to do for textand that too much in terms of doing the right thing wrong thing happened happening and more about did you have any dark faces on a personal level like did you go into any form of self pity at any point in its normal I know I know I am not talking about if you stretch that self-pity emotion but did you ever feel a sense of Darkness around youWilliams video super successful in film batane your health is taken it ok to do know you can put yourself back to doing another film get used to it and find your purpose is actually and that's it is a story that will drive the story is what drove me out of it is going to get this story is from what we loveinterview earlier the time of the day I got diagnosedwill the Infinity war and I had an awesome Telugu film industryit brings about 2 to joy and pleasure bike let us stories coming that can be brought to you by brought me back to what I needed to do likewise each one will find what they love the most whether it's music for somebody whether it's reading from readers matter what it is you just gotta find what you love and and find the bestthis is just different function of how I behave with them I appreciate you sharing this heavy nested like it's not an easy thing is a Republic platform soap appreciate that Jhalak Rawal asks you have a sense of Belief in God and does it play any role in your careerwhat you are able to do it yourself is that that's the that's really the energy that is where I leave faith in something else or someone else with great reader for learner of everything that's old and comes from inside knowledge you read spiritual books have been on offwould really in a direction of stories whether its a book of the storyteller come to me like anyone saying something so right so that always how I've been taking things and and from the story will come moral values thoughts philosophy everything ok Rishabh 11 years how does Rana Jagran shoots business work and stay consistent and avoid burnouts because it might getmobile me and this is something that any creative professional faceseverytime I try to figure out how to get it done and and doing things that will bring you joy in the sense it brings the others also want to put that out so I guess we'll both ways it is worth I also want this from the Geeta that and popped up in my head through your definition of joy which is karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana which means that you just give you over call without carrying your results your competition overOK then asks do you listen to podcasts because you do seem like a dude you listen to podcasts I don't know why if yes what type of what caused you listen to what you enjoy isEntertainment Award topic what genre it can be about an automobile it can be about somebody gone to space doesn't matter but just if I get a point of you that is very new and unique I'd like to listen to check out certain episodes of the Ranveer show like son episode ok ok this is a very nice question Raghu Deshmukh us Rana the huge fan of Mahabharata how importantis mother Mahabharat foreigner in real life how does implement lessons from the Mahabharata in real life if you need to get them doneyou avoid these characters become energies and energy but you nice channel did you get when you doing a certain task then you become the Arjun other and you get it done or vice versa want to be another character get so it's you are if you can't take them take a story strong enough as an energy and be able to implement in lifethat's pretty much how vi these were written in the first place that starts a beautiful answer man Bandhan OBC a follow-up question for me as is there a particular character of the Mahabharata Secret Life of bees Arjun that I've got a bow and arrow tattoo for the same reason but for the exact reason that you saidcharacter cannot right not what they steal the green then that's really what what are mankind is made of date of single nothing that extremely is right or wrong with me and agree that we are all living in and we got to figure out the writer ki movie 4 right slightly controversial question but feel free to answer in whatever way you wish Nikunj 1192 1596she is the bright side of the film industry can Rana share some light on anything that dark that the Aam Janata wooden no is4th Industrial Revolution where in its content and stories that have taken friendship with everything you whether you want to launch your friend whether you want to make a film with the idea or two for peace of storytelling That Matters across the pot so I think today the sense of being a storyteller Robi in the creative industry has many many more works and and give your longevity in terms ofBijnor to create that you can do as for as long as you live and continue being inactive for as long as I will do if I can consistently be good at same applies to a musician x y z whatever you are so that's that's the beauty of the art such that no age got no limit to power in terms of anything and it looks to be an interesting question Amit Mishra ask how did Rana handle the pressure oftelling anybody why kattappa killed Bahubali and sharing your so again the character you played in Bahubali your to bulk up for it so could you justGandhi audiences through the bulking process this is what planet and asks and also the following question is would you ever do it again Badi bulk up that much for a charactereverbuild 6283 single day for over four years of my life and training to ascertain whether it's without very very little or no breaks it all and you repeat that I was in terms of consistency and that we get Girish Aage Uske kar asks is there any sort of a void in your life right now and if there is how what are you doing 2 filmnew thinking of failing at everyone and again and that I will feel that work with beautiful we are looking for everything you create man on a personal level I'm looking for everything you create in partnershipchitrakatha you can De made of and boys dream alive and I would say so for all the boys and girls out so god bless you brother thank you for bringing mythology back even if you are just starting out of that process and thank you for being a storyteller I am sure there is a lot more stories coming out of that mind and other business managers and mining what you are doing again using Your Fame the like build things and just taking out as far as it goes good luck would have itgod bless you before you leave I have to ask you to say just three quick pieces of life advice for the youth one Europe places in you can do this so you can do that because it is saying that is because they haven't done it before that sold so which every time someone says which means it's an opportunity and you will be the first one being able to do that again that's what one needs to take this secondlibraries threw things at you whether it's good whether it's bad will keep throwing things at your not quick enough to just pick the good and drop the bed with speed use be going backwards and not forward so I think whatever life throws at you be cricket understanding this is right and this is where you want to be and movie for there is a long-term relevancewhether you are making of film or whether your make the t-shirt whether your whatever feel your Android 10 years from now should in packed influence or other directive to some change of the world that you want to see these other three things that probably leave thank you let you go thank you brother God bless you keep growing keep sharing all the stories and all those ideas thank youthank you brother God bless you keep growing keep sharing all the stories and all those ideas thank you

and didn't really know what is going to next mother's life nh33 he became one of the country's youngest billionaires and is the co-founder won the country's most respected bootstrap startups 0 that we've already had Nithin Kamath Nikhil elder brother on the show's speak about the story of zero the this is Nikhil Kamath story his version of zero the zero has plans for the future and we want to ask questions about the stock market and personal finance in general elements TeluguNikhil the friend of mine is also one of the most relaxed but intellectual people you'll ever meet in your life lots of intellectual stimulation and lots of financial knowledge and lots of startup motivation coming your way with Nikhil Kamath on the Runway showzero the co-founder on the show Nikhil Kamath welcome to the Ranveer show thanks Ranveer thank you for having me now this particular the subject title is dropped out of school at 15 at 14 or 15 around that it and then one highlight from that should be how your brother claims are onemost naturally gifted stock brokers in a tree diseases is so costly but we actually get to the storied you agree with that said well I think as brothers we have to say nice stuff about each other through some part of it is exaggeration I'm guessing that I usually with my gas celebrate this letterbut I feel Laga Hai Yahan equation with you are you are you conscious of the whole billionaire tag which is associated with the commit brothers a Lil bit but it's a new things we don't know how to deal with it at your conscious but I think time will tell how we are able to utilise it if you Look upon it as an opportunity to do more than you think by virtue ofcapital I think is a good way to locate it also valuations do not mean you have that money right back anybody can be valued anything it's a company's valuation it does not mean you have a billion dollars in the bank so it doesn't really changed that much just put this in contact for a young businesswoman understand valuations and equity basically se person a create the company and don't 50% of that company eventuallyworld of investment in the the financial would say ok this particular company is worth 100 crore rupees that person becomes words 50 crores automatic at 6 at what you have in your savings account current account for your own personal portfolio is different from that of the two worlds meet like I'll tell you in the startup world right typically when you start a company you Raise funding to go ahead and you know spend on a quietgrowing your company founder don't have secondary dance by secondary amine is when they personally take out money from the company for a long time typically when you do many series a funding they will be opportunities for a founder to get some liquidity a seller part of his equity and take out money then that equation comes into play but for the most part a company's value is a company's value and not very often is it that personbut you think of it on a personal level because I know your getting into the dirty details Badi early but you are a spiritual guide have a spiritual inclination I feel you get conscious of done by personal level that why did life and it also really young men like people don't associate the billionaire with someone who is not just in the thirties early thirties at that so you end up becoming existential on a personal level with thatnot yet I think luckily for both me and then where is surrounded by people who kinda like mockers at every turn han colleagues and family and stuff like that so we keep all of this at check Kailash we were talking about earlier he gives a hard time is time in AdWords Men should anyone having these people in our life I think we do ok now your storySchool to become a chess player is a true that was intense partly true I think I was reasonably good it was growing up started playing very early to bed 5 or 6 when I started you know you play that you played the school level and you played the district the city the state and the nationally and stuff like that all of that happened dropping out of school was adonation of many things not chess alone the fact that he was not very good school I don't think I've is the best student got the best marks there are also other things it play like I started doing some business on the sites to sell mobile phones like old ones which years 9th Grade 2002 something like that Lil bit earlier than that I thinkIndian recorder job in a call centre at 17 and I think the the drive to meet money was there from the very beginning and I would say looking back at it I have more regrets about having dropped out when I did you meet people you know you made friends in college and each time I meet people they talk about how the best friendship in the best times in their lifehappen when they were in college and I have never had that experience and nor will I ever so you feel like you missed out on a certain experience in life that was specifically what you regret about dropping out at the only thing I regret the rest of it I don't like that but the experience is going to college which is in every movieyou see friends from college in its reinstated you know all over every time you meet somebody from a group of people who went to college together that i m s trading and probability that two talking about really I hold you say some very interesting and one of your YouTube videos you said that chess creates a veryenvironment in your head because it allows you to be creative within a framework of pay decided rules and at the same rules somewhat applied to the stock market and Finance chess is less about intelligence and more about the ability to remember every game which was played historically so you need to know all the openings that are out there you need to know middle game and game theory and there are a bunchbasic structural rules in chess you have to like train control the centre develop your pieces quickly Castle as quickly as you can you have to follow those rules and then you can you know at the extra thing which makes you are differentiated chess player not used reading but I think life is like that you can't not have any rules whatsoever for certain level of discipline I think was a lawmaking every success story happened what kind of this API if I were to be created with trading I would say things like having a stop loss not taking too much leverage diversifying not touching Penny Stocks that are used in trading there are rules in chess but what you do outside of these rules makes you different but you have to follow these rules again referencesPardesi date with your brother we called it test cricket it can I test cricket like you play a slower study game play article you play going to the Classic definitions of things so I just want to highlight something that you spoke about your you basically were talking about the concept of pattern recognition that ok you seen a stress games you can learn from it and then when you are in a situation where you want to win a chess mat you go back to one of your old pattern is this is similar to thatchess game ISO in 1997 and that the basic concept of how artificial intelligence works also when we do any topic ai-powered product so I powered apps that was happening at the court level u feeding a lot of patterns that system is learning it and that executing things based on what the old patterns which also reminds me of an article I read it into Asian human intervention of people with 6 and I can read peopleread situation at its core is basically pattern recognition for discussing the Australia Last Night the morning when this morning but it's basically you you end up reading some one eyebrow movements the way the eyes move the way that lips get purse stop or whatever is called in certain situations and then you are able to and a go back to your own memory andhighlight a moment from A pass wale ok in that situation this person was thinking in this way before Nikhil might be thinking like this in the context of this business in your let me say this will let me take this decision which is a very strong is a very important trait in the world the start of the game in just the professional world but doesn't tuition come into play in the stock market is well and is that why you brother call you would naturally gifted at this gameI think it was so I've been doing exactly the same job I do today for a long time ever since I've been 17 years old so it's been a good 17 years of watching the markets everyday I don't think I have missed a single market day if the markets have been open and I might be anywhere in the world but I am in front of my terminals or during market hours and looking at one thing for so manyeveryday I think give you a sense of intuition I think it does and everything is the same logic that it's pattern recognition and I am it could be a think there is no structure to it if you go back in time like the very early traders are there is something called reading the tape would just look at top prices changing and be able to discern trends in the market that has the kinda like become parson is nobut I am sure there is some level of in need you can call it feel you need to have a feel for what is going on in the market and that helps you decide whether you should go long shot what you should do it like that it could be like family it depends on if you'll ever did you know if you have 100 rupees in your account and in a hurry to make money if you born 1900buy something worth 2018 very easily become gambling but if you follow rules and you're looking to make save 15% or 20% and your in the market to Ghana value over the long term then it's not like I am so movies like Wolf of Wall Street for that can 92 show a new highlight Sone aspect of the stock market that they've shown which are not really true other than other than the lightcome to the technicalities finance what are they show that probably not how it really was sisecam 98 I watched it a couple months ago and a lot of what he did back then is no longer relevant or even possible because Technology has come in and kinda streamline the compliance around trading right Wolf of Wall Street and other Great movie that I love I think should people in our industry in a very bad lightI think people in that era were able to drive up stock prices and manually to a certain extent for the lack of Regulation and lack of p********** in the market not that many people access the market that time it would be very hard to do that today especially in large cap companies there is very little you know inside a staff or manipulation or any of thatcoming back to your story will you see your elder brother in organic active the stock market you learn it yourself like there's a lot of teenagers young college rules and fascinated by the stock market 17 stepper motor does bunch of them don't because they are afraid to the thing I know I don't play with money money is to real-world thing what was your mindset at what age you started at how would I think 17 I still remember cause I had account with Sharekhanyes why did Nitin being in the trading world already made a big difference and Drew me towards trading but trading is one of those things that you can't really it's not a team sport I don't think to people can trade together it doesn't work like that there is a different style of trading for every person and the best teacher is probably experience you have to you have to drive you have tomoney used to make money and then lose money again when you go through that Cycle many times you start to realise what you did wrong when you lost money and that becomes the the teaching from the time period and initial your playing with smaller amounts that was comfortable puliraju initially when I started to work in a call centre call 24/7 in Bangalore today is a when Call Centre started you knowinto the night shift night ride as well to the money which maintain was savings from that salary and I still get paid like 8000 rupees a month or something that was not the large amount of money at all but the thing with stock markets is it does not matter what your capital you bring into the market it is still a lot of fun outside of the money making aspect to watch something go up in value after you have bought it is very accelerating in a dickwinner a very weird manner but could you explain this photo very often when you buy something and it works out it is not because you did better research than anybody or it's not because you are smarter than someone else it's a factor of chance and you know many forces that people will not truly understand but I think the human mind is wired in such a way that subconscious dutribute to the stock going up to something you think you have done correctly and when the opposite happens and the stock goes down the same thing happens again you think you have done something wrong so you start to evolve and actually start to become a trader when you come to the conclusion that nobody can predict stock prices you could have been doing this for 40 years you might have more information than anybody elseit is impossible to say stock is a price hundred and it will go up to 120 in 3 months nobody can make that call once you arrive at that spot then you focus less about predicting the future you worry more about having risk in all market conditions you think if the stock was from 100 to 110 how can I have the best risk metrics in place if it goes from 100 to 90 the same refunded become 70Hindi new arrive at a model portfolio which should do ok in all the some circumstances and then you just close your eyes and pray for making predictions on stock prices impossible and I think people have to realise that were really again if you are to light signal out one particular skill would probably be pattern recognition for anything else I would see more the ability to be able toobjectively read sentiment at the end of the day stocks move not because of how the fundamentals and changed not because a pattern which happened in the past will replicate itself the entire premise of technical analysis if you watch TV 9 people keep saying moving average crossover head and shoulders and stuff like that it is based on the premise that the past will repeat itself I personally think market activitywhat happens tomorrow might have an organism parantu what happened in the past so I don't think that helps as much would be able to read sentiment the stock price is more if more people want to buy and less people want to sell it to look at people around you and figure out if they are inclined to buy I think that really helps to understand in human psychology I think you would be surprised buttrading is essentially just understanding psychology understanding what investors are doing understanding what promoters are doing even to the extent that understanding what leaders and politicians are doing cause that in turn has an effect on what happens to the underlying companies right for the analysis explain what equity trading is short so each time a company needs to raise capthe either go to a bank or the go to you know a private equity firm which gives money privately if they want to raise capital from the people of India the public they go to stock markets so I have a company eggs I make hundred rupees of profit I need 10 rupees to grow my company so I will go to the stock markets are saying I'll sell 10% of my company 400 rupees you give me the money and then you will come share holders in my businessthat is essentially equity being created and then people buy and sell that equity constantly and that is equity trading speaking about human psychology so you understand human psychology Velamma scale because of trading in the stock market that also teach you human psychology on a very 121 level you think about better rid of people has won a lot of people tell me I Am A terrible reader of PeepI don't know but I enjoy psychology a lot a beat fuminori Innova psychology around finance or even the behavioral psychology aspects of think it's the most interesting thing in the world to try and understand what somebody else's thinking and what is driving them to think in a certain manner I find it fascinating butif your brother called you what are the most gifted traders he knows you know what goes on in the head of someone like that like like you like a few if any value knows if you look at a proven that with zero the everything you guys are done at what goes on in your head is actually born with the gift of being created finance on every day basis to constantly think of the stock market other number slashing you know nothing like thatone thing the stock markets teach you is humility is you might have been doing it for 15 years you might need a lot of money trading but the minute you let that get to you 21st year will you know take everything away cause every trade is like your beginning and the trade is not concerned by who is placing the trade very it the ecosystem which is very levelingX-Men 2 capital and someone else might have 100 rupees but when you buy or sell to the market your exactly the same but outside of you know being able to read sentiment and having having a lot of experience in trading and stuff like that I don't think I am doing anything special the only thing I've learnt with time is the rules that I have in my trading systems and these are not fancy yourthese are not things which are difficult to replicate in very simple stuff as long as you did the simple stuff correctly and you don't have ridiculous Expectations you can't go into the marketing I make 30 40% every year if the risk-free rate of a certain country is its a 5% inflation is around that if you are making 19% return if you are trying to achieve that I thinkmarket survey great please the one thing people forget when you compare stock market with other investment like real estate or Bank fixed deposits and everything else that is available in India is the liquid nature of stock market you can sell it at any point of time and you can take out money and that makes this product a lot better than other products which don't have that aspect of liquidity we all talkwhy so many people are coming into the market today I personally think that place that has a huge factor to play in all these people in the pandemic realise they might have a plot of land somewhere they might have a home Somewhere But if things go crazy and the need to take out that money tomorrow it's not easy but in the stock markets it is and see that more money will come in by virtue of this reason is won yesterday we were talking abouthow generational gap Sar reducing basically means that Nikhil born in 1986 and Ranbir born in 1993 of one generation on 1 1997 is a second generation phone 1 1989 is a third generation of the generation gap is reducing which means the world to getting fed up with new of pressure more advanced and more rapidly advancing mines at than ever before which is why I feel that huge burst in the world of personal financemanagement all the way you know your average person on the road is also concerned with how do i x money went through Mutual Funds through you know the stock market for everyone in this whole ecosystem that the country's Kinder entered zero there was a very right moment app but you guys began as with the intention of just starting a Portfolio Management Serviceand then something happened the longer we also got underweight let's Nobel product so my question is what happened along the way because if you can you guys are great rather than sure done a great job as portfolio managers for Chennai is only those people who invented with you but why did you all go down the road of creating a tech startup through the world of Finance because it is given a lot of inspiration to a lot of entrepreneurs mother mains examopen content after speak Mithun I really starting over how I can incorporate back into what I am doing right samjhoge also had some kind and inspirational moment like that and that my question when we began at the very beginning we wanted to do broking because we were traders and everything which was available out there was horrible it was very expensive week-long ki so when we started cost was our unique uspeople came to us because we were charging a flat 20 rupees and everybody also charging half percent which is evident times as expensive as us are the shift from cost being the US B2 Technology I think to be fair I think the credit goes to Kailash and Nitin maybe when we hired or when Kailash joined us I think that's when we actually became a tech Player andTech products and everything around Technology has largely ignored when his his doing all the all the credit there to him and on a larger scale I mean the only way for us to reach millions of people across the country is to have better Tech products and other people and reach them online I don't think the brick and mortar way of doing things works any more in fact Bombay this weekend at the meeting a lotpeople were in the brick and mortar Industries even these guys are now exactly what you're talking about right now they realise how important technology and I want to adopt it but I think I think it's very hard for someone who has done staff a certain way for like 20 years to suddenly change and become a different kind of company I think of Ton in every companies life cycledoes well right everybody associated with that company like I was talking about reading a liya is naturally surrounded by people were treating them like they have some superior ability of the gifted in some way by virtue of what happened to the company many times how well the company does is a factor of timing luck and where who was at what point of timeimportant for people running companies do not forget that but more importantly I think you have to understand when you are becoming less relevant in every industry in be able to replace yourself with people who are smarter from a new generation like you are hearing to earlier you see my generation being for lack of a better word for gifted them like the previous generation probably would say so I think I am 34 now and I'm sure in 46 years I will become less relevant than I am today and the new 25 year old will be better equipped to do what I am doing but I think I have to be smart about that and I have to make sure I find those people today and not wait for me to you know you become less competent in a way and then do it that that if company is going for much longer and also about the guy who started it allhumble and taking feedback man like something out in a team review recruit younger people to join our team sometimes your to arrogant alag listen to them that so others can be had of filtercopy dice media there was a simple copy of Windows is a start your Pita from them right and how do you keep your content relevant measuring your content is putting off how do you help topics you know popping in your head and said the beaches hire younger writers every year you hiredfree born people Highway 95 born people have the 97128 justify the younger and take me back right from the bottom I think I think we are there I think in a couple years me nobody remains the largest forever write like we've gotten lucky and with the largest broker and like we were talking about Asset Management be coming back into Asset Management in a way with Ruby kin and focus on your trash can I space but in a couple yearslike everybody who is you know me on a train or anybody else who play playing a role of leadership has been doing what we're doing for 10 years 11 years or longer in many cases to be will have to bring new blood in and allow for that new blood to take prosaber leadership is the older people become less relevant speaking about new blood of God take you back to the time you 15 and I don't want your mind that was ended with a verycollected human being is doing his own thing but was there any kind of fire to prove yourself after dropping out what happens once you stop going to school you feel very insecure your friends your classmates of the time go on to you know colleges and they have a certain trajectory for you read a lot to overcompensate I think I went through that phase accessory cell that you did whatever you find interesting but while you are reading your not actually reading because yourinterested in what the book has to offer a part of it is you're interested but a large part is you kinda like dealing with your own and security or not going to college writers you feel like a child I didn't go to college all my friends date but at least I am you know reading and learning in I am not being left Behind during the more valuable education in some cases yeah but in most cases no I would say causeI don't think I would never recommend dropping out to people we got lucky but not necessarily on the people who dropout you'll have more than ten or twenty who get lucky the vast majority to have that formal education structure behind them prepare them for so many other things in life which dropping out not right and I know that you can highlight luck as a big part of this whole process but other than that on a very like you win levelwhat did you do right from the mentality perspective of Tom And execution despacito not from a business perspective by Nikhil what did that 18 year old 19 year old think correct what do you willing to do that University of the rest of your life when we begin broking in 2009-2010 we were coming of the financial crisis which happened in 2008 stockkids were not cool broking was definitely not cool with very little Innovation and money being spent on doing new things in stock markets so we started at a point where there was a vacuum in a way for anybody to do anything new in stock markets and took advantage of that if we were to try and replicate exactly what we did back than in any other time Navy in 2020 feet wide I don't think it would work so thatuse path and and personally I think I'm in my entire career of trading or broking Asset Management the one thing I think I have the one thing which has been a little bit of a differentiator is all the time and are spent on the stock market I am sticking to my knees I am not trying to build something where I have to start learning from the basicsthis is something I've been doing all my life and I am attempting to do new things in the same industry is essentially the same job but with different cancer now adding that makes a huge difference between an iPod highlight something for you because I just feel your to ham log I so you may not highlight this yourself give you spoke about sticking to your needs but in essence that preparation for your moment maybe the 2008 crash wasmoment budget spent from 1999 to 2007 just keeping at the luck factor could be that you found your Vibe alien life you found something that you enjoy something I'm coming at you but you kept at it and I'm sure that even once all began zero all those learnings of 78 years of work with just came into play right place right time and I think what you mentioned there is very important the fatliked this job the fact that I like this of stock market and that's to be differentiated like after 17 years like five years down the line if I would not make any money I still think about visiting and reading you never to be losing money they enjoyed that much I think that was the real differentiator I mean they say that success happens when preparation meets opportunity I also feel it give that another which is called the muscle of funreleasing joy in your when you speak about the stock market auto financing so now after zero has been established the obvious question is what what next like you guys any does a lot of people would probably stop doing the job after the restore point like which is the carbon brothers we revise the planning for the annual like you know hiring more building teamswhat's the thought process will right now I'm spending a lot of time on rubique in which is the Asset Management Company what ok hold up I need you that really little what time management so if you want to invest your money in equity markets to get a return you can either do it yourself or do it through a fund manager Asset Management has three Kinder licences in India you can be a mutual fund you can takeany amount of capital you can't really had too much hedging is covering for Risk by taking a position on the short side you got a break that down so so is se I want to buy Reliance I want to hold the lines but if Reliance Falls 50% I want some kind of insurance so I will buy 100 shares of Reliance and then I will also add to that the instrument forpaise to rupees on my Hundred rupee investment on Reliance to cover the of possibility that the stock fall 30% save the stock Falls 30% that to rupees will become 20 box and Alive Alive kinda like kurti the part of the disk using Yolo yeah yeah but that to rupees is coming off my upside is that ok goes from hundred 210 I am 808 so that is essentially hedgingMutual Funds Mutual Funds can do any hedging you can take in 500 rupees thousand rupee investment there a pooled investment vehicle where a hundred investors put money all of it gets collected and aggregated and then invest in the stock market the fund manager will typically charge you a 2% management via and send the money you make to present on the money invest the money invest it is expensiveit used to be a lot higher and they were distributors and all kindly cages in place the regulator has cleaned it up to a large extent but still a lot of work needs to be done the second mode of Asset Management in India is a PMS where you need to have a minimum of 25 lacs you give your money to fund manager again and he manages it feel the Third way is a category 3 alternative investment fund which is what Ruby can hear you havebleedy two heads up to 100% so you don't have to necessarily bet on the markets alongside I don't have to bet on a company going up you can bet on a company going up was a company going down and gain from the relative arbitral which is available there I'll let me give you an example in a mutual fund if you want exposure in the IT Space you will buy in process in TCS in a category 3A if you can buyincreases if the price has gone down and you can short seller TCS at the same time short selling is whenever you bet on stocks price going down if something is 800 and I short sell it when it goes to 90 make 10 rupees a profit so in a cat 3A if I think Infosys is relatively better as a company then TCS I can do that transaction and make money out of that buying in process and selling TCS whatallows for you to do is not be so dependent on market cycles you don't need the market to go up 10% or gradually grew up every year you can bet cross button companies in the same sector in different sectors that would we do it Ruby can then what does it mean for the consumer for the consumer you have stable return profile and a much lower volatility profile than buying amutual fund SIP for example if you buy mutual fund in the market score of 10% you make 10% If it goes down 10% EWS 10% but you are you can create a risk profile when is the market go up 10% you make 67 % in the market go down 10% you only lose 3 4% for it gives you differentiated differentiated risk profile which is very attractive to many large investors so let me just get this straightabout getting into the details of the finance on the technicalities of it you basically creating a system where consumer Where are really rich person can come and say I want to get profit from this money no matter what I will Park my money with you I will invest in your company you can handle my money and got them ok very likely that you will make so once the amount of money which is higher than what you mean by allowing the money to just be back part in the back exactly it becomes very attractive now because interest ratesyour Bank FD with 50 give you at 9% of 7% now if you like for 5% so people like what is the minimum is it like you said I'll try to write about a million dollars is minimum and 7 crore people start the word scale it significantly beyond that the other thing which is wrong with the Asset Management world today is se Ranveer wants to invest100000 rupees into wealth product when you go to share private banking and wealth advisor the guy who is going to sell you the fund will charge you one or two rupees t**** 1000 mm already in the fund manager will charge you another 2000 rupees a year if you make money if you don't make money will charge you that and then there will be a lock in period you can take out your money for 2 years and the whole experience is not very transparent trying to checkthat you said you won't have any middleman Sonu distributors when you invest 100 all hundred goes into the fun we have said no management fee if the 2000 rupees your paying with your normal found here we don't charge any of that we go to the extent why we don't charge broker clearing please custody accounting Demat all of this is zero the only thing we charge if the hundred becomes 110 at the end of the financial year10% of profit as a feasible take one so what we're trying to do is become more client aligned and only make money if the client makes money but still charge and much much lower than any other fund manager out of 10 people do not realise that if you pay 2% in fees in 20 years compounded that of your principal it it makes a huge Dent in the return profile you receive after 20 yearsand we felt like Asset Management in India and across the world has not changed for a long time through beginners attempt to make it democracy is it anyway and make it a lot more transparent removal of the linkages and a lot more efficient Richard do you met last night is the CEO of that company I hope to bring all the podcast you got a former Royal Air Force pilot who is like both the corporate veilthat crazy but from what you say for sleep do you think that you said that things have changed in the last 20 years so the nodes of the finance was sort of know this like they know that this is what happens and that the business model they were adopted so you are applying zero the logic your again let disrupt everything was thrown something but the next next question is this I'll try it and I see their customershow do you find them in the first quarter is your own personal network first it used to be personal network but we've been doing this for about 18 months now so we can finish the personal network very quickly and now we get a lot of different referrals and there is a Lil bit of which is going around and that gets people interested in typically people seek out for performance and transparency result right and I would reach out2 hours on their own and alaska's about you know how is it how does it work how do we get involved with zeros are basically tackling everyday consumer with young college ke XUV 5000 rupees to them and then the other part of ecosystem your tackling your business owners of the world and its very interesting do I find it for a long time in my life I did not really meet people all picture do the whole sale standard thing rightEid a very very rich but be the also very interesting you know everybody is the story everybody has a story everybody has a Ego and everybody has a perspective they very opinionated and the fact that I did not meet that many people for so long and now suddenly in the last 18 months I am like during these new relationships and meeting so many people it'sdoesn't matter who you are what you done when you go to somebody and your asking them to invest their savings with you is a look up on you from a certain length so you have to like sell the product every time and I think you learn a lot from that even now laga do you guys have zero that your credit get this straight again maybe a ultrathin eyes of the nineties it would take the seven crows and problem for itpeti operate your home in something else and you create a new option for the Ultra my question is what do the Ultra HD nice of India Today think like can you can you generalize can you I can of India so the problem in India is there all to real estate having a and the they don't have enough diversification and a lot of money stays in The holding company is there main businesses and they don't like to invest in things outwhat's the logic protection lagao and protect myself I think it's a General distrust of people outside of their own holding company I think in large part fund managers Mutual Funds banks private banks are to blame covers a lot of these institutions have left of people over the last few decades and now this large promoters are like instead of going to them usemessina business less hassle lesliganj all of that will try to change that at the end of the day any business and finance is a business of credibility right so the way to build it in my opinion is being my way transparent will it takes time I started now and I don't know how long will take but it looks good so far in the last two years the company has come a long way to again speaking about these UltraTech when I'm assuming that you be embracedsales role recently deleted all you have to learn about CS places because of you can learn as a billionaire founder at 34 and you can also learn it as a 21 year old concept of the same as it's very humbling it so you still now I started again going to like in a lot of meetings in person many times will make you wait for half an hour and then in your mind your like being a bit candida your thinking like do you know why am IMysore today what after the meeting is done and after I have seen what the company is capable of doing I think there is a need for a product like this and I think this company will go beyond just Asset Management to have a network of civilian as from across the world so you have a nice day in a South Korean American Indian to put themall on a platform and help them connect with each other in a in a manner which is better than water private banker old school merchant bank has done up until now I think will be extremely interesting think of it like because there are no bridges between the geography as a Nigerian oil refining I would never have thought and his wildest dreams to approach Indian cement maker to export cement to thatbut if we can build a bridge on this platform beyond Asset Management I think that will be a great ultimate goal for this company and and information at the end of the day and knowledge is something I really like gaining and this gives you differentiated perspective because your talking to people in so many different sectors on every day basis outside what you can read in the news this is the best and knowledge can get Androidlearn about what is happening to Cement price by being a part of this transaction then just read about 7 price in the news and I think that in turn makes me a better investor and a trader does the saying I think from the US military they say that the leader on the field is always right which basically means that if you are the middle of things you have the best opinion on a subject and use might report something but you will only know the truth when you're living through ithow strongly believe that your greatest living the life come from going to people and if you are a podcast host even better with other get to do this on a biweekly such a big difference 100 zoom meetings with clients and staff for during the pandemic but what you learn from physically meeting someone and talking about whatever it could be about the industry you can never replicate the non AC room callwhich is why you dropping out may not have been bad for you again I hear you hear what you think but not everyone should drop off but as long as you are that urge to learn and as long as you ask the right questions does nothing that can stop you from a well-rounded education and life and education is not limited to college degrees in books education is about your own hunger and your billion and humility to save one thing I just thought of it like right now when we are talkingwhich makes me up a little bit better than others is my ability to deal with things logically when it's like when there is Chaos and things are going bad I think I am able to compartmentalize a little bit better and remain calm in rational and make the logical decision versus The emotional one I think that's important in investing by trading as with any YouTube what the Saga of make thequotation about myself now so I am not take more than likely that was there in your 20s when you guys would building 0 the training is always yours by design things happen like this pandemics ok 27 march was Chaos that I mark itself for you guys if ok withbetween your Habitech product is different man Tech products we are typically used to a day with the market you that goes up half percent of 1% in down of a person and 1% in that in turn leads to se X million transactions a day on a day when the market for 10% or 15% the number of transactions will be like 5 volt and everything changes I like how you servicesinjection the amount of time the load on everything it gets fake your Attic and the flip side of care less if we have like a minutes down time now like it should relative to every other broker out there all of a peers if you would like put the amount of downtime each one has had you definitely be on top you probably have the least amount of downtime but even then if you have one minute things like spiral out of controlevery journalist start calling you that are talking about it in CNBC and approximately 1 minut market volatility in turn leads to all kinds of volatility wow even when you select a finance career you are at the mercy of the market was happening in a will have effect on your whole organisation right to the bottom that but again like what happened through the pandemic did you guysSiri exploded is always that is always growing but the pandemic is where things just went through the roof I think we we can you like can factor two or three big reasons as to why so many more people started trading in a people wear at home they had more time at hand always wanted to trade didn't have the time now they have it into free fire coming downplateauing real estate sector for long time like in India Red residential real estate if you rent home should buy a home and rented you probably get about two and half 3% and the capital appreciation which happened in the 90s and early 2012 not seen in a long time people are coming to terms with the fact that when I invest money in residential real estate a the order fit increasing in value 10there is no longer true and to 3% is not really a return which even matches inflation to they have to like look outside of real estate and Bank fds to retain well against inflation not even make more money that definitely played a part in why all these people are coming into the stock market but I think outside of all of that like volatility it it gets translated into newsend noise used in noise intern translate to more people in assuring that there is something going on in the stock market anything subconsciously attracted towards which is what is happening with script after SQL without script to now before we get to the Crypto question the precursor question to that is a 22 year old of today 23 year old of today that has an intention of being rich for lack of a better word what should his financialright now be according at and considering that not everyone is drawn to the stock market as much as you go 22 year old let's morning 50000 rupees 20030 20000 rupees saving say about 15 to owning 20 in 75015 a very frugal 22 year old are doing thattake advantage of remote work and this book from where you are skill set and probably save money by staying at home I think I think at 22 your appetite for Risk should be larger so I think spend money on yourself this is one thing I have realised with time and my experience is in my personal lifethat 15000 and tended towards learning a skill training yourself to be better that's probably the best way with the highest odds of Getting Rich because once you later that many skills in foggy weather 28 29 you be so much more desirable and a lot more people will pay you are lawyer I would in fact If yawning 20000 you can say 5000 rupees a month in a bank that 5000 is probablybetter spent learning that gives you can move from 20000 to 15000 the issue with this wasn't really 22222 I feel like always had that little bit of patience and write long sightedness still going to 2000 of today are not patient and and I'm saying that like some Dadaji Dam just five years old and I feel like the different generation with different waysthat smartness is flip side is a serious lack of patients want everything now that you would prove yourself is the earliest start at the bottom you will learn a lot and then the explosion later but keep at it advised to 22 23 year old especially in the whole entrepreneur ecosystem is spend as much time as you word on you're not trying to figure out what Proyou want to solve on on picking which industry you want that problem to be and you never want to be swimming against the tide pk sector and industry that is a growing and looks like it will continue to grow in the next 10 years like that give an example I think people who are doing anything in fintech all broking of Finance right now probably are in the right place because in the population of India only about to 3%Appa country has direct to indirect access to financial markets while that number is maybe 95% in America something like this population will grow definitely spend a lot of time picking the right sector like if you are in the if you're young 22 year old boy trying to start something in the mobile wallet space it's no longer relevant you know that industry is on its way down what's theI think u Pi killed the use case for mobile wallets structurally and ok Crypto we gotta talk about this is the most common questions we get after the session will take out the Twitter questions 1 km in 5 hours rapid fire but let's talk about Crypto wallet but like what is your studies money and the behaviour of money inside what is Crypto for you and ask you the technical definition of ityou see it as an opportunity to grow your money as a consumer report you put your own money into Crypto let me free face and I'm no expert on Crypto I personally do not have any I don't have any of the popular cryptocurrencies available out there so when you think of currency write what is currency essentially is government explain it in terms of NikhilRanbir 10 rupees again so when I give you 10 rupees what that not denotes is if you take that not to the Reserve Bank in our country they will give you something of a certain value that notional value is the 10 rupees now government debt and its leaves appear out of it and the talk about the dollar because in many ways that kind is the currency of the world and thatKinder mix rupee the vortex and the euro be worthwhile so back in the day when you took $1 to the Federal Reserve in America they would give you the amount of gold and that gold give value the dollar the gold standard got removed at a certain point I think it was Richard Nixon remote it and then we had another system the bretton woods system where every other Global currency was back to the dollartoday said we will no longer give you gold and if the dollar is it 50 rupees you can go down to as low as 45 we can go up as high as 55 but you will trade in that range relative to the dollar that changed and now we're an ecosystem with the American government has been printing a lot of money if you want to look at the average amount of money different might not be exactly right herereduced be something like half a trillion dollars a year over the last decade it became a trillion dollars a year I think now it's something like 5 trillion that's the amount of money they have printed in the last one year logically if there is more supply of something the value of the should go down but the value of the US dollar is not going down because a lot of the countries outside of America hold a lot of American death and the value of the death would comevalue of Dollar way to go down clip other countries have a hold of dollars is it Canon service use cases as to why the US dollar is relevant and we all benefits India for example will be the export of services rate if the dollar depreciates by a lot aa IT companies will no longer remain relevant there are many many like in a tiny creations here and it makes sense for the world to have the USwhere it is right now and it's working for everybody now if we continue to print money in the manner that they are at some point in the future it would be logical and plausible to think that they will be you know many people who will question why is the US dollar still holding this much value when there is so much of it available in the world when that happens cryptos will become a lot more relevant people willtrusting governments with the currency that the government is providing them IC Crypto to have a use coin at that point which is how far according to 20 years they had to call but I would say much sooner than 20 years and on the flip side the problem with Crypto is it's not good for government we had that Silk route issue whether we're selling all kind of stuff online and the fact thatsee which is not really regulated in any manner is attempting to challenge the Global currency is we have today will not be looked upon for only by governments everywhere you are taking over control from the government to a large extent and the woman's I think we'll make it harder for Bitcoin to any of these cryptocurrencies 20000000 all this being said a currency which is that volatile is not ascurrency if I told you the 10 rupee note you are talking about earlier what you Apple today tomorrow you could buy a car with that same 10 rupees a day after tomorrow you can't even buy a chocolate with the 10 rupees you would not want to hold that 10 rupees it and not not hold it in the sense that you would not want your entire wealth to be sitting there will be interesting to watch what happens with script was going forward but I think he'll be a fightgovernment will fight against Crypto across the world but they will be weekend in that fight if we continue to print money the weather today it would you invest money in Crypto in the next two or three years because at the train right now officially the world of two it was overtaken by cryptocurrency and general Bitcoin in general ethereum in general are you in treat would you put some money just leave it if I had to go back in time and whyone thing I think it would be great to just because of how much has officiated but will I buy today probably not I think for the reasons I mentioned earlier I think it is not just fairly but maybe overpriced considering all that is happening in the world today and I can properly point can you think the Indian Government and 2018 report the regulation that banks can't do business with bank accountscripted and then all the local exchange is we had here at to shut down and stuff like that I think they've got a new study from the supreme court to High Court against that mandate but the government has still not when the said people in India should do Crypto but if this happens in something like America we don't know what the new government things about cryptocurrency and even an officer shot while but if they come and go against Crypto I think it could fall 501984 depends a lot on the SAT is a completely out of your control your brother recommended ceepens to me was reading the Third book by URL at that point and Sapiens taught me a lot about the concept of fictions around us with basic and and again yuval Noah harari is a big character on the spot on the whole you reading all is books that opened up my mind coming back to fictionthat the ten rupee note is a fiction you owning your house and Saina document is a fiction who decided that a document a piece of paper can't decide Nikhil on the particular house and who decided that the jacket wearing Ruby prices over in a world surrounded by fictions when he goes on to say that the concept of Patriotism is also possibly a function when we want to control a very large group of people you create aaround something that will inspire them or create an emotion within them who decided that governments should control the country and this is like a very and ask his style is it completely agree with you I I don't know how I don't know the audiences and I don't know how this will be taken but Patriotism in its truest sense has lost a lot of relevance in today's worldbecause of globalisation because it will nuclear weapons because a full war between two large country is no longer relevant and I think the world would financially and economically be a lot better if not for patriotism we celebrate your item is patriotism in India but were not as bad as the Americans could America you find a flag in front of every third how is you know if the world was not to have bordersif it were not to have distinction based on you know all the stupid things we distinguish people based on I think the quality of life of the entire world the access to resources would go up like the world today produces maybe seven times how much food as the world requires today we still have people dying of starvation and we have climate change issues we have so many things that will be helped by a less patrioticwhat is the thing is because Patriotism as a concept has been around for so long and I believe is very good to love your own culture negative Bin born in a particular culture and raise it embraces everything that ok countries culture stands but if Patriotism is something that can get you to hit someone else or to attack someone as in any way emotionally writer hate comment under post then you got ask questions to yourself I totally agree I agreeembrace your culture I don't think you should fight for your culture if something is dying a natural death is something is progressing or transgressing into something else naturally because the world is moving in the direction I think we as humans are too small and I think it would be very bigoted in a way to think that we can change that and retain something which is naturally fading away I think we have to be more accepting to changenot just in religion politics evening companies right things change all the time are the sooner you are willing to adapt the sooner you willing to embrace change I think the more the more relevant you stay for long as a company that spot at anything your business kar you I don't think so I mean to be physically fit is very relevant if you walk into work not feeling physically fit it it affects you mentally butside of that I think I used to be competitive at some point I think with time I have become more and more like less inclined to be in a very competitive and stuff like that did the stories I'm kind of this happened to me I had like simple things like sleep wait hours a daythat I think genuinely means I'm becoming less competitive and interesting though I hope it's a click of you know you become less competitive and then you wake up one day and get dry when when when he was I know that I'll try it and I can get that comparative award ok Sofia I want see near the end of the volcano in the chemistry I have with you at your favourite ekad many more places but I decided to INRtwo sections in every podcast one of which is the rapid fire from Twitter where list of the water sending questions for you and the second one is possibly the few deeper conversation on life in general I asked that if you had to ask one of India's youngest billionaires Nikhil Kamath of zero the any kind of question what would you ask him personally Ramesh Mishra ask ask if we can find my startup I need to start dairy farm in organic farmhometown lines on my father is a lying idle and here I am struggling to make ends meet many cases a business can be started without external funding in farming I'm guessing you can get the capital opening because your in the world of Finance you have to study multiple kind of industries what is the future of agriculture in general Somani mixed opinions from people actually banana there's a lot of potential speak to business contact Vivek Bindra medicines and odhavIndustrial law and order what's your post I am no expert here but if I had to wager guess I would say aggregation is the way for a lot of what the government is doing also seems to be internet that we might we might have a world where we have fewer farms but much larger and a lot more organised that create all new problem what the farmers of today were do and will have to as a government I think p.m.remix show that taken care of and they have some other Avenue to I think you ask me my goal in about I am doing under 20000 jobs at for something something my heart says that I have to do something for the agriculture discussed on my guys who had office fanatical opinion here I think this is no taxation on farm income right I think beyond the cap it is it has been miss utilised so much in our historyif a farmer is earning more than 1 crore I think they should be Income Tax should be taxed like other people in the country the small form farmers of course have to be protected and adding that change will bring bring a lot of clarity in this ecosystem next one will more personal the Hariharan as it great seeing you doing a podcast with Mr Nikhil ask him how he takes his success after the lock down and how is handling it rightwhy don't you explain the concept of success and no you don't even think you believe your success I don't think so I think I am still in insecure person in many ways and but all for yourself with people who are sceptical about everything your doingland value in their opinion is important I think you're still available it as long as it that the next question from the same person is what made you guys believe that your idea of starting zero the would result in success when I was starting out what was the initial again it was very organic I I don't think I am a big fan of planning also because a planned many things in life in there were never really worked out it wasorganic Bihari that we would be successful because everybody wants to be outside of that there was no like intelligence there anything and books and people that inspired you reading a book which I just finished fear of death fear of mortality at its very very interesting who is it by the denial of death Ernest Beckerhe talks about how we as humans forget that we are creatures are we have a certain amount of time here and the way we live life of 10 is like we think we want to hear perpetually so why is it important for me as a 34 year old guy to know that average life span A70 and I have 35 years left in live my life according to that was thinking I want to live on for hundreds of years in perpetuitysubconscious thing I think we live like that and we don't realise it but when you put a finite number there I think you become a better human being in many ways to become socially relevant to the amount of greed you have goes down and all of that I don't know why I am referencing this inventor ICSE school where we had some fantastic poetry Thomas and his poem about the Greek goddess who falls in love with a really good looking human beingenchanted by his raw sexuality and in the poem for kids should blessed him with the blessing of immortality with the blessing of Immortal youth this dude becomes old brinkley is body parts start falling on the whole Poems by dark mode how possibly being a model is one of the biggest cases you can go through using of 14 year old is changes 14 perspective as wellremix Ankit asks and founder of India's biggest trading platform what are the changes you guys are bringing in to pull in the youth of the country because even Nitin Accord with thought that the youth is the big customer at 0 education is the only way I think our system of pedagogy in India we teach kids for 15 years how to make money but we don't teach them how to manage that moneysomething is missing there and it would be prudent for the government to add you know financial literacy early the middle school I think that structural the will change things got a popular masks resources for learning stocks and Finance for beginner and you are so very interesting second question how much finance knowledge is enough for you to begin investing in stocks first one is varsity we have a platform which is great for beginners to thissecond one I don't think there is a finite amount of knowledge that you can actually define I don't think I have enough knowledge yet as long as you know the rules I think probably more important than knowledge a bunch of people are going to highlight among Pilani question bunch of people was this same question Nitin has got a lot of and boys and girls by after interview people love is Rahul Dravid of life how do you guysbut I can't imagine that no you don't interfere in each other that helps but at the end of the dayone life in your brother's this if you don't have each other's back forever who has read we remember that even if there is a slight clash we know last 5 minutes left right ine thermacol followsbecome as good as family I tend to keep things within and I don't communicate where I should so my interpersonal skills are not up to par the very bad Nitin on the hand is much better he is here is a great EQ and is very good at resolving conflict with his personal relationshipPooja Sharma asks how do you keep yourself motivated now the markets its I don't know if it motivational addiction but one of the to visit place and what your opinion on breaks because again when people are seeing this bootstrap Monster calls Hero No one thing that is done by human beings who probably get tired and go to the mall D is a very we all go but we don't really miss market days I will Mr market day inover a decade how you glow of weekends like you did last night I had the opportunity to go this deep with another human being unhappy make friends with and open up my mind your smartphone and the mirror on the bottles have somebig blessing of my life and district spending time with you when your friends as they was incredibly stimulating ok an interesting question Verma asks what was the pressure like in the early days of starting $0 when apparently was getting threatening calls from other brokers because we all had like disrupted that whole part of the finance world as she does not that bad I think it's overstated with time buteven at the very beginning the people we worked with close friends that they were people who lived in the same Apartment where we played cricket growing up there were people were friends first and then colleagues a lot of fun with that we are not making a lot of money but we would definitely having lot of fun to play Counter Strike for 5 yrs it was a day that I don't knowit was a lot of fun football build such a strong sense of humour and Team Spirit post my guys to play football football after this guy interesting question again Prashant medicine La asks what is every person in India launch to trade on the stock market theoretically what will happen if we could I think there are there is president there are countries in which 78%population has light direct to indirect exposure I would say not 3 but even in the US your photo and care some kind of equity component in it will become competitive will become a larger market in to become a great place for companies to raise capital let you know that is Abhishek Prasad asks what is zero thinking of rural area development and actually I would also lost in oz UC rural parts of India getting into fintechpersonal finance as a concept which will emerge from all that has happened where organisation will slow down to a large extent and Tier 2 and tier 3 downs will start picking up will be interesting to watch what happens in how much financial exposure to these terms in this is your request for highlight the lot of questions about Ruby can coming in which is your brain child so and young kids a call it gives you asking this questionI think almost all the other questions have been answered through the Cosmos of this podcast but I will ask you one last question from this rapid fire round sudhanva asks what's the role of newspapers and current affairs in your financial game site is asking for trading stocks do you think newspapers play a massive Road know how to keep up with current office you read the newsbut I think what what are you replaced I don't think about call financial earning as news after they are not reported I think reading a company's balance sheet and actually seeing how revenues are changing and margins are changing mixer much more seminal impact in reading use which has been published because they believe that just for you know leadership and everything is exaggerated rightbecause it reached the end of a podcast you ask me yesterday menu planning for this show and I really deep questions and Loki deep guy and Kunal Shah Twitter about this one is that the big gift entrepreneurship other than the obvious ones that money Fame power is that you to go through a journey of self-discovery when you are not purchase so true you get the sea the most naked parts of your own mind your own insecuritiesget to know yourself with people believe meditation does the same sitting in silence for so long your going with them but speaking about business are you happy now and you have a sense of spirituality with everything that happening around you to be honest I have not understood spirituality I have many friends who talked about it and how much it has changed them but I asked them what is spirit speciality for you each one has a differentI think it means a different thing to everybody in terms of happiness I think again it's a very relative concept relative to any other time in my own life I am happy your today for sure I feel less insecure about many things that I felt more insecure about historically Kare Kare Rudali ask you for thousand securities that from a new vision and insecurity is a birdfeeling less important than I actually was about relationships about financial goals about money lot of that what is it will all through ever since 14 15 16 it has been there different points the different in security has played an important role maybe in the last couple years it has been more around relationship feeling insecure therethe people you care for if they don't care of you and things after you know we all have relationships with all kind of relationship and friendship with your parents we have romantic relationships all of that I have felt insecure in all of this reduced because you lived through your late 20 January 30 what's that like another view contact to this questionlike early twenties about finding your feet and understanding where do I belong in this world just finding some sense of popular want a finding your purpose but just finding something to do your mid twenties about promise solidification and learning learning beyond college in Academy and demux I am curious to know what your late twenties are because my reading of it as a 27 year old is that now you've found your feet you solidified now it's about getting your weapons polish top for47 agree with you I think late twenties become about consolidation where you start it different for different people I am guessing that you start achieving scale and you become not an expert at what you are doing but you become a lot more proficient I'm only going by my experience but I think 30030 is the time especially if you have don't have dependence if you don't have kids you are not doing enoughtube baby to be if you are alone you can have to like you arrive at a point where you start questioning the purpose of everything a lot more existentialism yeah I think midlife crisis which is to happen in 50 is not happening in 30 is because the social media we could be thanks toproblem solving at every also through this part of the particular is it carried on 40 for men from Indian guy where to live your life that is it because we can Indian guys do go through that that that that one Stark form of success in that Indian guy space where to enjoy a little kid that unless you want money you want any respect in the society which doesn't even matternew think about welfare game controller but if scared in your kid that 30 years mark what was your mind the light and what happens to people around I think in many cases you start thinking I wanted to do a b c by the time I was 30 am not done so you are am not done a you think about that but I think you changed a lot more at 25 25 is a bigger birthday than 30up until I was 25 to enjoy my birthday is in GSM 25-34 year celebration and moreI know that for girls in summer spotted with Saman media friends we get very conscious of the skin and wrinkles and aging and I'm just like you know him even older women are attractive I have you had the idea that wrinkles are not good guy what happens for you done until you like the changes you notice first if you go and have a drink for example right you would be hung over full 1 half an hour 27 probablyfive hours 834 it does not change your body takes longer to recover if you want to work 2-3 days in a row and you manage to get 2-3 hours of sleep only it will hit you the fourth day you will fall sick may be a 25 did not happen socially you are judged a bit more than you were when you are 25 for example if you are using a man like I'm guessing youlike am I I don't know if it is more about honesty this after you finish your and I think this is would want to know more than the other questions we spoke about tonight's life out there that I had a very serious relationshipDon tattoos like it kind of put me deeper in my work like that was productivity while it was the scale of my own vision and everything became more motivated you know that this is going to be seen whether Ranbir Kapoor movie Rockstar in that zone where busy Tute Dil Se Sangeet sangeetbroken relationships are you can just be through any kind of heartache it could be feeling life after business collapses whatever it pushes you want to like and extreme drive mode and definitely will have been in that for the last two years which means that I am a Lil bit emotionally unavailable because my team needs that emotional love and care is currently ship reflect the my kids and direct the love their Radhato stable relationship which means on the flip side that I had a bunch of not so serious relationships in relationships are not been messing around not been sleeping around and all that but I know it's not been as serious as what my older serious relationship was created tempted deflecting and not answershort answers and black single right now man and also strongly with a good way to promote the fact that your single sign-on applied podcast started between the concept of arrange marriage to me if not exist in the for adults and a girl who has a great for arrange marriage problem the same mindset is a guy who is a bid for a generic which is that why not you can have fun with you don't have to go the traditional weara lot of dates which mum said sure that's that the plan man also I have dated a lot and had my fashion of one you just onward travel that this moment you have on travel way of looking at mountain snow peaks on tomorrow when you're looking at in lakes job clothing in this board and that the real Joy of your problemis mustard appreciating just your own self experience what you see through your own eyes even more than love that I know that your your beyond this area your back to appreciate and relationships now and I also strongly feel when it comes to happen if you have to define happen is objectively that what you want this stage of Elijah what experience in a recent past really cause you to be happy I had this notion thatship should be all-encompassing like you should get everything from that one person that has now changed to it is issued and put that much pressure on one think so you know you have like a hundred people in your life you get something from my friend you get something from a colleague at something from my brother and all the love together makes you feel fulfilled I think that helps a lot when you're getting released do you feel that you believe in destinyif I do I don't understand it yet I think of 3 in life I have taught you something to be destiny but then something else has happened along the way and my version of destiny keep changing so I don't know a lot about spirituality in his pocket and a boiled down to just being a good person and I see that and you like the way you treat people when I saw the people in IT industrymeet our human beings but other than that like and I also see a lot of men in the thirties nobody wants a career as a set or at least Carriers have strong Direction they search for deeper answers the search for spirituality is the fact that I don't have any dependence I don't have anybody to look after everythingI do in my life only if the situation changes there is no end to hold it there is no ok I I didn't have a now I have a I won't be what you do with the PF not figure out yet but I feel if the situation does not change and I don't have any dependents you're probably end up becoming more socially responsible and do more for others at the end of the day it's it comes down to that way back to lovenew hot romantic do men like will but that I am interested in a tell you the truth I have had for relationships in my life and every single one I have been dumped and I've been on the receiving emotionally unavailable and slicing your perpersonal life exactly that is so true I think what works at work does not work outside of work and to remember that in practice that is very difficult to remember my first co-founder of Rajas to your younger than I am I had the to your head start is way Ahead Of Me mentally now after spending for use in the real world but back then had to teach him to be a little heart less and tough that kill the kid inside I'm a riderpersonal life as well and you got a drawer system is a man come back and just learnt the switch off and still be a child with your mum will be your romantic romeo with the person your dating I think I was watching on TV on Netflix bridgerton or something like that it kind of made me think about how much time we waste wondering how we are being perceived and what people thinkwhat we're doing in our personal lives I think if you paid less attention and we did what we truly want will all be happier both persons in both of the parties in a relationship would be happy and spoke about perceptions Road question man but you know the billionaire tag does carrier sense of status with it and you see people treating you different after youpublicly acknowledged as a billion and feel women saree treating you differently people are probably a bit nicer than they were before I mean I will be getting myself I didn't think that women on the other hand maybe but I have not experienced it yet but like the people aspect like what happens to people suck upa little bit maybe but I will be deported yeah I think I think what what happens I the biggest thing I am trying to change is kinda like to be a bit more Din accessible I was the kind of person who would be friends with absolutely everybody and it puts you in a uncomfortable position with new people thepeople were friends for life Janu 10 years in 20 years they remain the same their own your ads as to what is happening to your family in all of the day we like they will bring you down to the ground by by quickly but it becomes harder to have objective new friendships because you don't know what the agendait's not too bad but Lil bit another rude observation Manoj with us today at the energy in the room was positive people chose the surround yourself with the ups and downs in own personal world but generally it was possible what does someone in your position keep in mind when you cutting of slash accepting people in the world into your world is it intention of academic and this was help me discover myself bettermake me feel comfortable and I don't even think I think that much I think there are two kind of people one who find negative about a lot of things Pessimistic people who are generally complaining about something that has happened and life typically takers in not givers and there is another set of people who are warm sharing giving and are optimistic in adverbin many ways university right that everybody has issues something like money does not definitely eliminate them if anything the scale of issues become larger but when you find those people I think that time to will be to hold them closer in the past I have not done the best job with my relationship not just a certain kind but all can you had that what you think with your work I thibecause I was more insecure than I should have been I would walk into a friendship relationship thinking what could go wrong versus focusing on the good that it was giving me at that point that you are 34 old speaking up yeah I promise that that that was which is when you hit the 30s mark that you give you are able to notice weaknesses in your own character oryah message chatting now because this the general way to you know what I would do is when someone said something about me I did not like I would be like you know where defensive about it without thinking about it now them defensive about it but maybe I think about it before I am defence with with the relationship water gold O Yara video open your sonif I'm even dating someone not not very seriously but I am in a relationship with someone from holding that girl hand that problem my best moment of the day even after the most successful or most traumatic professional experience the add-on that particularly loved us for human experience man I think relationship goals are much less the person has to be a bi Si Di but I am somebodyvalues the ability to forgive for giving people a lot can we all grew up Reliance grew up a screw up to find a person who is very forgiving and values peace of mind as much as you I think would be the most important thing that most men can't stay loyal and I can't disagree that are romantic guys out there want to like you have a long-term have you seen the Pixar movieold woman and old guys have Disney shows their love story for kids till the time they became more than the lady passes away but I still love the full movies but what he does after her death does something that fulfill 14 wishes for guys like that out there which we associate with the relationship of a subjective to every relationship the key here might be to communicate what you are willing to do and whatwilling to do and what you are hoping to get from the relationship and I feel like as long as that communication is OK your fine in the relationship I've done A terrible job of communicating in the past I should not be here any kind of a Proton protagonist and explain or talked about this dude that's the nature of entrepreneurship in general in new tab somewhere behind do you do that again learn from my mistakes that what made my business grow this is what I help my personal lifefinal question regarding the selfish and about Meme and services youtuber who opened up so much light on the show what you think I am doing right so that I can add up all over my weapons I think you did last night bye sitting in chatting with are still 5 in the morning so it does not feel awkward now and I think you have this you look verygenuine and you feel like you're asking a question not because it has to be asked but move because you actually want to know and that is that sense of curiosity which is very endearing friend main Ankur warikoo is also YouTube from the Sadiq he had answered my questions during the lockdown existential crisis as the meaning of life by working so hard that you'll never find happiness unless you define your own version of happiness and he said that his version of happinesshappens when he satirises curiosity keep your curiosity and answer in it and if you have

Sudha Murthy mam just speaking with you know is an owner hosting you on the Runway shows an even bigger on a thankI am you know usually what I do with what causes we kind of warm it up for a guest and then eventually we give them a heavy question with you even before the interview started you made me very very comfortable when we come to have to ask to heavy question write a front what is the what is the meaning of life according to your and I'll tell you why I ask you thatLord of people my age does a lot of people younger than me hu dealing with something called existential issues we hear a lot of people see what is the meaning of live wire working so hard what is happening someone who's had a journey like yourself I'd love to hear your perspective mam identifying their first year is elephantdelete element elephant everybody has their own way of defining life because it is with respect to their experiences they may be sister sister but lifethe day the person has to run it is not the father mother husband wife children gift to my definition of life is entirely left to my experience and highly subjectivebetter happy or is The Contempt contentment like in beginning of the day I get the work which is useful to me also I learnt more than normal okVIP road enough to ask you don't have to you don't have to use all the adjective we can directly as okdance with I am just hyped about from the previous this is definitely one of those because this is honestly something I visualise for myself this is a big big day for my Kari of let me be very direct with you about the the question is going to ask what what do you think is Mr Narayan Murthy is meaning of life I understand your meaning of life and you think it's the same and is that why you know you are considered one of the country's most successful relationships that you have a line goalhow to tell hundred percent what is his concept I can make a train with him for 42 years and more than that 43 yearsonly getting data the aim in life and give 100% to that and that he believed that creation of well is to the nation is very important it is not enjoy a well thought to create that we do not consider is important when creating jobs create in well drinking paper from from lower level level to up better level is meaninglife it means a lot to give respect you then then you should know that quality for example is to tell about 40-50 45 when we go out people don't respect they they don't knowbecause India showed Indian showed their capabilitywow ok I have so many questions about the marriage the relationship in general but I will pick your mind about a little later after first ask you something more related to yourself I know your movie buff and I also know you know the amount of positivity and motivation you put into all your books and the same that's the kind of energy at writing in my creative work as well as always a certain underlying sense of upliftment of positivity and movies are a big showof weight comes from your particular kinds of movies someone ask you from your perspective is it is it that is that we watch movies to get a sentence as a perspective and you just really enjoyedthe tune you know that acting and that is how movies are just not that it is much morepositive it affects people particularly teenager in rural area lot more and it has to have a positive message believe movies and just content in general carries the something I believe inthe content of the movie should be something nice then only entertaining and making money and showing which which is Really effective because it has a great on our can I ask you about the five character building movies of your life like if you could go back from all the movie is used forbhai sahab Madhumati Aditya road from this day I am not 75862 years into many movieto list is not 5 then it was a greatexcellent actingname the name the lord of romantic movies so that that's probably something I have gained from your answer that you are you enjoy your romantic filmsnot worth it for the respective initially but later the otherbecause that's not have a lot of young peoplethat is Rajalife doesn't show any competition you are a big childYouTube face it except valueerror did you should I forgive you ok forget is better known in the best life should go on in life you can get stuck in a place and that's the reason after Oman real life where you are to believe that person under the 24 by 7 and that it offers will be recognised each other for Androidnegative but you are enough to understand that it comes at a package anybody has become the package comes with the packagenegative thing and move on in life that what I can tell beautiful especially considering the in your life this is a slightly difficult question and only asking this because you are a writer so your maybe I wouldn't ask everyone this question but since you have writing experience may I ask you what would you define your life as before during and after theInfosys in one sentence each so if you are to define an adventure patients in an unconditional lovewhat everything unconditional love for your help but unconditional love for that condition of unconditional love for your companyI have unconditional love and passion to help you know very little is known about you from your childhood in your teenage you live in the US know about you is you know that you you got your donation and philanthropy ideals in your childhood but what else do you think went right according to you live your to gauge your own childhood and teenage what has gone correct for you which has visited the older version of yoursthanks your parents for all your family for thatwhat I have added a couple of them like my grandmother told me when I was young child you know you should call everybody the child who is two years okused by Morgan and his love for to be loved by grandfather taught me practical is life into food but you are very practical in said how to run the help of compassionate you should do the people were hungry ok who you should extend yourself with the difficulty and whatever they taught metheir product my grandfather Tony 16 years old better place to drink tea and what is it not come70 years and it is not always do your workgo on helping keep your life is full of AP in helping other than thatbut then it happened OK then everyday routine your to write 25 lines then namaskar aap to god I did for long time but I continue to do you spend money without resetgood health products in the queen of all subject lover other people about what do you feel that added to your life like the way you say that this your parents give you that this I am sure what is givenhusband and wife always learn from each otherthe passion that that takes you up and passion you require that you are your own and people behind you are with you that I like this pattern made it to the built-in forces and of course with a lot at early I did a lot in Philosophy along withup I can have the cake and eat it too you can do that if you want to expect when you go back to the beginning of Infosys and on a very personal perspective what was going on in your head when it came after one sided ok this is the plan this is what we going to do what was your first Instinct when did you visualise all this happening like that you have a feeling that it would go down this pathI never thought I'd never dreamt of a company is doing I would do I have to help him a lot because he was working hard was passionate and and you want to do something because the entire community of our us know but it didn't know I did not know fundamental of business but you know what were your early at Imphalbetter word brutal learning like you know at the start of was what were some tough learnings for youvery very young and when did you realise that things are picking up like any incidentI mean it was any lekin that first tenure period I am sure they would have been some of these would you be open to allwhat everybody we are same did you have moments you know you had to motivate your husband that usually what happens in marriages and I'll be very honest with you for one thing at least kids my especially when my have grown up watching this movie was Spider-Man you know where Spider-Man going out and have you seen the original Spider-Man like the first 10 andis he going on saving the world but the love of his life is staying back and she she helps in through it motivates I'm so do you think you guys had your Spiderman Mary Jane equation back in the dayI know whether company started a small housethe one which gives correct either way you can talk to youAnderson and always happy today you are you should always be happyenjoy life do you think that was going wrong with this whole generation you know the kolahol generation the mental health issues generation right and the lord will attributed to social media a lot of people attributed to the pace of life now but what your opinion on thisperson to whatever is there which to share sharing became caring and sharing sharingare you with your children if two different religion to have an independent India after 70 yearseconomic condition of the country was different economic condition of the country and we should not say something is wrong with the generated if it reflects what is there in the with the now where the family that your plan think everything is plenty then you don't get you it ok to when you are brought up in prosperity then then the thing makes you happyholiday what's the Year ok from where the great thing today youth Children Day Delhi Agra Nainitaland get it to happen and get it I didn't get 157ok noyou are you can get at hand but don't drink and don't make it in Acer all in your head but they went what happened the part of that if not in your for that you should go on adjust adjust a nice to meet you said that you keep going to the next year and your expectations and when did not met you get unhappy becausesinus problem the core of why all these things are happening and that's why you think so much sadness in the whole generation to the question is on a very daily level what do you think is one mentality switch that people can apply that you may be you learn se in your twenties and love to know that actually Khud dial back to your version of yourself in your 20s what was one daily mentality switch that you are appliedGoogle educationPatel for a simple and be happy for the college where to go to study well I don't know well anywayattitude and that is also wanted a mature that 45 feel like you've always thought positive thought long-term you be fine like you had that visiblematterlearning new things everyday make Kiss Me Ek so it's strange you said that because the was going to be my next question for you anyway I feel like your lifelong learner and the case with a lifelong learners who writers is that they transform all their immediate openings in two books into content so you are coming out with the new book right now what in that book 2nd year notes for children and thirdly what are adult lessons are you put in itgrandparents by soft stories this is a series of grandmother stories is a second book in the series 2 din covid time when the law of tort grandchildren come to grandparents house and her grandparents help others think over time and along with that every day they will tell story the story about 17 aur 18 and every story has some meaning of positive meaningtube stories make things positive you packaged only of positivity from this phase of your life into those books into all books this book for have you have you ever had come and tell you that may be your two positive thought tends to happen now a days especially given with me if company not content that's feel good everybody know this is all Falls this is take positivity but I know that's actually how I thinkabhi office something like that children why why would you tell parents to purchase this like what what init 0 connector child loanand in that time the best time for them to make to read them in this period and every lesson 10th something related with let Ho right not found out we do not found out I'm more important that you should have many people in your life then you shouldexample with builder building with many pillars not the one pillarrealise what you're learning when you grow up I Feel Up big bunch of ethics and morals come from these experiences so why is it that problem what you are trying to do right it some very heavy like that you thinkmore about I want to talk about books now because writing made me to realise many things that in India we require English writers because majority of metro cities people go to English medium school and once I write in English they will be translated into all Indian languagesthe bird the golden being the best of stories that the grandparents that of story then single books on and got it layer and how was a big episodetheir culture related to their connected to that we require that the language in English children of today and I am also talking like in comparison to a child feel every younger generation is very differentnegatives but what are the positives like do you think you know that because of the internet because of just having so much information around them think differently but I'll have you seen your end consumers mind change you see in your customersformal writing is important after right I don't know I am not got any feedback to it that way but I have many people telling me that reading the book that changed their children reading that they told me but but from from all the younger people you meet this is what I see like even I am 27 and even222 road I feel like the whole other generation of the 18 rose is another whole generation so I am very hopeful about the future of India what's your what's your take on a dawai going to CV 100 more Infosys style companies are we going to go into very golden time todaywhat you can write you can write and convey your ideas to other writing because we have a twitter words and some heavy questions that have come in for youbut feel free to answer them how are you want if you want to make a answer short long it completely out female ok cool we will do that so the first questions from Yashvi burger was also a youtuber she has asked the very straight question which is that did you ever face any kind of relationship problemsHindu marriage without up Centre but what what is the core of handling it like you just be stay calm during the situation so the next question is if you had to just in in short explain how you managed to kids a career supporting an entrepreneurial husbandand you know all your other artistic endeavours what to do you know say what is the core of that whole process for you ok when when did the realisation of giving back to the community arise this is from why Satvik and were there any in a battleEurope throughout that whole process when you meet your goal did you have any inou-battle yourself about ok How we going to give back or Europe on my personal level what what do you think is a part of my book one of the book and the subsequent books they are absent in the difficult question of handling people coming to me that I ratingI stopped drinking milk three thousand stitches old and is god related to my work even today the next question is from Chitransh Motwani yes even today how have you stayed grounded like how you stayed humble through it all I know you answered it but maybe we can highlight it again for the questionabout me and I believe in it and just talking about it I believe in it then nothing special that she asks that you had interacted with Dr Abdul Kalam as well what are you spoken to about him and could you elaborate a little bit on him like you know what was he likewe always thought about that thought about education and be happy with everything that happening today in India like about how his vision for the youth come true I don't knowwhat

like Bitcoin ethereum on its effective hearing about explained simply explained so simply that a 6th standard 3rd standard students will understand what Crypto mean that aspect of it from this Crypto basic conversation this is Sumit Gupta the founder of one of India's biggest Crypto based companies coin dcx sharing the knowledge he studied for the last 10 years and your knowledge back 10 to 30 minutes enjoy yourselfSumit Gupta firstly welcome your Ranveer Jo thank you Ranveer secondly you are one of the most insightful vehicle amendment to your back yes in Bangalore yes I am going to somethinground trip to and when the time is that will have you on the show the time is right time is right here I am so height in the last 2-3 weeks in the last 12 months baby what happened sure so what happened in the last one year is it happened and you have seen a lot of countries printing trillions of dollars money coming into the system so what happened here isat the Fiat currency that is INR vs dollar Euro that we hold is the value in overtime matlab all currencies of the world so rupee and water Australian Dollar value themselves against the American dollar so they are related what happened earlier whatever Fiat currency that we had was backed by Gold until 1972 73 Uske bad rahe the money that you have that comes into the system that is no longer to Gold and the government can print as much moneyI want now we have seen us printing trillions of dollars which is equivalent to the GDP of India imagine that much of new money coming into the system the value the things that we can purchase that hundred rupees in in few our future right you will not be able to buy that much so the inflation can happen at the value of a fiat currency is going down over time pahle sau rupay mein bahut hi jyada Itihaas Aur Main Kuchh Bhi Nahin Aata right and as we are progressing that money will continue to develop over time so what people do is people usemoney to invest insert instruments now all of that money is new coming into the system write an affair is getting the values of people have started putting more money into Bitcoin why Bitcoin because early people used to put money in Gold real estate equity markets equity market is already at peak real estate and not giving that much return so what people have done as people started seeing Bitcoin as a good store of value people of RH they don't buy gold now buy Bitcoin write a very good healthinflation so whatever happens to have Bitcoin so lot of people including companies like Tesla people that started putting their cash reserves in Bitcoin rights that they can that if that appreciate in value the cash doesn't deplete over time so basically at its core if you want to become rich you want a good investment strategy cryptocurrencies in general one place to look at and Sneha if I invest my money is likely that I will get profit over time is a very good portfolio diversification if you have one lakh rupees you can50000 rupees in mutual funds 20000 in stocks 10000 rupees let serial state but you should have a part of your portfolio into Crypto primarily Bitcoin which is the store of value to the very good education inflation and very good essay to have a part of a Portfolio so I will ki you are prepared for your from the crypt world I am not a content creator and I am looking at investing my own money but I used a lot of Twitter and that's apply for a loan a lot now had your most awkward awardI have heard all the amazing Naval Ravikant ok so much wanted to look up to achieve something in their life and they are talking so much for taking a part of women in putting it into it was talking about it I want to learn the basics again while I know the basics I want to ask you some more advanced questions which we will do the second part of this podcast but bro matlab if you had to explain Crypto 2834 oldwhat is sure to get the real world example in when we interact with each other there are various ways we transfer value right we either give value and form of money in Warren form of information know when we do this trade of value or information we need middlemen right for example if you are taking if you want a cab unit companies like Uber ola if you want to buy product online you need Amazon these are the companies whosethis level of Trust between two individuals directly transacting with each other write a while because if two people want to communicate the nearest Central party Imagine The World where you don't need is middle man and two people can directly transact or exchange value with each other without trusting a centralised party Vikas centrist party can be corrupted right there in future if there is a way you can transit or transfer this valueover the internet that blockchain provides a blockchain is basically a technology that decentralized that isn't so you are no longer trusting a part of a single entity right now we trust banks but we are seeing what happened to the banks in the past night we don't have full transparency of how they operate in a decentralized manner you will have full visibility the entire ledger is public and you can trust the system more without without the need to trust a centralised particle system isabe so se the case of a Punjab National Bank that now if I put all my money into the payment doesn't happen maybe you're going to say azara to purchase something and I give that Punjab National Bank card or any other bank card which is kind of it going through a rough time it may not work it may not because of their flow like Punjabnext of their management of that particular Bank best of their work and then your money and your spending power get affected so you are saying that blockchain will remove that gap between you and your Zara colleges in order to do a transaction you don't need a bank you can directly transfer between two individuals not the money that we have right we trust someone that the money has value but where did it come from right at the trust come to the trust come from because we trust these middlemenwhat is brokers to build that level of Trust just because that have Society of Corporate area if you look at the evolution of money houses of us back people use to transact in Gold right there were kind that are made of gold and now then because gold a based on the actions are difficult to do then we shifted to a paper money at which used gold as a packing mechanism now that is a ward lekin Bose several years now money is not backed by anything right so tomorrow if a bankdown without you your mistake you are getting affected you know if you look at 2008 financial crisis what happened that was a mistake by some of the banks were there given bad loans and the whole world got into recession that not happened after Bitcoin was born write up pseudo numbers name called satoshi nakamoto he came up with the way where how can you build monetary system without the need to trust banks and you are sure that if you own certain vitamins that completely belongs to youdoes not have you know need insurance from anyone is from a centrist party it is your own money that you have full control of doing now a news 20 years into the future when Bitcoin and cryptocurrency the more common if I want to buy your suit I can pay you in Bitcoin and urea cooler received and you give me your so rather than you're having a debit card machine me having a debit card putting it into your machine from each other phones offerTechnology will be able to transact between ETA yes that can also happens if there are various case of Crypto asset side one example Bitcoin is an asset just like how you treat gold Bitcoin is like that it is a store of value right are there are certain currencies are the government will develop this something that you might have thought about CBCS Central Bank digital currencies nocb disease can replace the current financial rupee write that can be a digital rupee which runs on top ofblockchain wala ful transparency of how the money is being used lete there is a donation right with over a lot of forms where is donation now you want to see the entire ledger how the money came where are you go you will have full transfer is transparency the entire system that is what blockchain provides God so I'll just makes it even simpler for the end-users basically I will consume a lot of Crypto constantly and the understanding I got about blockchain was that I am not saying thebut higher authorities have a lot of layers so when you are trying to say transfer money from India to Bangladesh it has to go through many many many areas but with blockchain coming in you can skip all those levels are they going through the easy route from person a in India to person behan Bangladesh on transfer money to Shakib Al Hasan and I am sitting in Bombay I just 1 RK Palace inside as if you were sleeping all those layers of governmentsalthough the Bureaucracy and as possibly why government are a little afraid of cryptocurrency yes you are absolutely right so this can be technique in theory it is possible that you can the transfer aware that it is going to many lives even though she became a profit of the money transfer that you are making As human beings on money for themselves so you are sleeping during the money transaction is between Ranbir and Shakib Al Hasan in Bangladesh not all those layers of government officials and right so if we see how we transfer the moneywhy do I apply to you if I sent thousand Dollars to someone in the US it is not paired together at various middle mentioned what are the reasons of people sitting in physical Bank branches were making the transaction happen and that takes lot of time that cause a lot of money now with blockchain you can do all of that instantly near instantly and almost free of cost zero need this model when the system is designed in a way where you can transfer value efficiently what's the whole financial markets can improve can become more efficientsufficient but farmers secured and cheaper also that will save billions of dollars to the government not talking about transferring money from one country to another that is why regulations comes into picture we don't want a world where people just send money to each other anywhere in the world and that is why regulation 17 fuel terrorism like wrong things that a lot of the public has a negative opinion on Crypto dating ki yaar if it becomes powerful thing like terrorism things like time also might become a possible it right but right now I will get the datawith script or less than 0.3 % of the transactions are not being used in the right manner write a mean like if you look at Fiat currencies all of these activities will happen like with INR with us is that still happens Crypto makes it more transparent now you can track the transaction that the positive of it matlab ok let me get this straight so that the users also understand se if I am buying your suit ok someone who also owns Bitcoin in USAanyone know some interesting No Entry but because the data of Ranveer and Suman than a transaction of me by your suit is in India that person sitting in US can actually view our transaction ki haan theek hai ine donon ke bich transaction will not be able to see whether Ranveer and submit the condition but they can see in the larger the transaction happened at this particular timestamp of it is secured transparent without revealing The Identity of the people were doing returns as if like let's in the case ofman sitting in Afghanistan wants a money to buy guns or water setting them and they have Bitcoin cryptocurrency if they are buying on the bottom of this is an expensive purchase and USA buying guns and bombs from I don't know maybe someone sitting in USA making themselves that the big purchase everyone wants Bitcoin will no ok there is some part is that happened in Afghanistan which is a big amount usually doesn't have the something scaryso now let's inform government authorities or whatever and send it to investigate the kya hua kahan Hua the good thing is that when you're using a cash write a thousand 2000 rupee note there is no trace of it here you can completely trace how the money went Kisne Kisne kharida hai did you go to the second person vahan se kaise kiya hai and what was the ultimate place where the funds are used with this with the right regulations you can keep complete check on the trace of the fundwhether it was used in the right manner or not that is where regulations will help the country to use the positives of the blockchain technology to use the positives of the underlying trend that we are seeing how can we make the current financial systems more efficient or keeping the bad actors out of the system actually we are saying that all the Crypto officials like yourself you are also some leading the charge for Crypto India we have cleared duty 1 class bro quickly introduce yourself towho are you what do you do I am an engineer at an entrepreneur I have loved solving problems are doing experiments are taking rest in life as you can see so I am during my college I learnt a lot of things about new technology script was one of them after that I did my first job at Sony Japan that's what I heard about Bitcoin for the first time it is difficult to understand between was difficult I had a hard time I left it I did not invest if I would invest in 2014 I would be a millionaire by now right side inbut then I felt that that one of the things that had what if I have learnt that time now be the same state whether everyone is curious about what is bitcoin what is blockchain technology and that the thing that was all like how can we bring Crypto to India was this very little activity that happening in the country where if you see the other countries they are more progressive they are adopting blockchain their building solutions they are making their current systems more efficient the making and Bitcoin friendly tiptoe friendI feel every opportunity for India to grow your nuts that you read on Twitter a lot that every other country is figuring out ok how do we work with Crypto and in India lot of people especially older people are saying we don't want to just because that is that there are issues like yourself but you arehan to questions one just give the audience some perspective that if you invested se around 1 lakh rupees in 2010 in Bitcoin how much would that be worth right now I think that would be worth more than 500 karod buy no 1 lakh rupees in 2010 she was more than 500 karod I've read this American Twitter handle he had started investing his dad's money in Crypto he thought you will create afor his dad 2012 2013 he took some of his admin 7 registered in 000 what happens is that it blew up so much that it became his retirement fund and my return so that's what is this happening in the world in financial education when it comes to investing in mutual funds in the stock market but this is modern financial education you need to see the rest of the world is doing coming to history you know how they say that a lotcountries in mediaeval Times disorder expand their thought about new technology with about going and taking over the country that the British rule is rule does also keep in mind in South America the ancient civilizations were completely destroyed by the Spanish and a technology which our country is a dog new technologies become the kings of the next 100-200 you didn't understand is that for Indians to understand if you look at the internet write in 1997 companies right now we are seeing Amazoncompany built on top of inter internet was new 30 years one right people didn't know that will use app like Uber you know eBay to do the transaction people come countries were adopted Internet no internet also a lot of things people could buy do wrong things on the Internet now people country is regulated countries tried to promote the use of internet within their people and then now you could see billions of dollars worth of companies or trillions of dollars of the companiesinternet alone India was a little little bit behind in terms of adopting this technology in what happened in India currently has 44 million it developers engineers we are we are not that advance in terms of creating this company's right now we're seeing the safe shopping guarantee as amazing set of talented people right we can build this company is leveraging technology right now blockchain is one such technology India should not leave behind them you'll see all of these blocks and protocols companies coming out of the other countries not as much happening in India because theunderstanding about this technology is fairly narrow in the country what you done to do to solve that was launched the platform called vi learn which allows any individual to learn Crypto blockchain right from the basics of what do you do specifically what is this is the India's simplest way to invest into cryptoassets to buy Bitcoin you can buy Bitcoin as low as 10 to 1 Rupee value in best 1 Rupee into Bitcoin you can do that why pointthis confusion FIR I want to invest in Bitcoin but I don't have the money to buy one bitcoin that's actually not true you can earn Bitcoins with how much in rupees right now it's tougher on 35 36 X 36 lakh CR and also by 1 Rupee ka between which two point zero zero zero zero 3531 Bitcoin has like hundred million parts Santoshi Santoshi Santoshi is that Paisa rupiya paisaok and you are actually through point is it also educating people about the use of Bitcoin so I mean if you had to educate someone right now is completely against Bitcoin what would you say or completely is cryptocurrency because also Twitter India is running a campaign #indian2 Bitcoin what are you guys fighting against is a government coming out with some kind of policy to ban it what happening itsso my money in Bitcoin so what happened is in previous back when government was evaluating it they were looking at Bitcoin as a currency right where people could use it as part of the payment system where is bitcoin is not exactly that because it can help you transfer value but if you look technically it was thousand rupees to send Bitcoin from one person to another that technically not feasible notso a government have three years back 5S back cover of websites which used to accept payment in Bitcoins and of course in there can be bad thing that can happen but in the last few years the role of Bitcoin as a currency has diminished now it is evolving more like an acid class 9 of Tesla investing into Bitcoin write their own to send between from to someone else I just want to hold it should be invested 1.5 billion dollars in Bitcoin addressRobert and that's with the intention of justice hold onto this money that's let's hold onto that money and try to accommodate as much as possible right now we go 20 years back in time when gold was less 8000 rupees and you know that gold is going to go this way you would want to hold it right this was how much like the right now I think it would be around 50 lakh Rupees 1 Kg 1 kg and maybe long long back it was worth a thousand rupees 100 rupees also at gold is a long history board was also one rupee at somenight and it has evolved as more and more people start trusting and that the value depreciates why because gold is a supply constraint thing right you can't just make gold of 10 year same is Bitcoin Bitcoin is stored in a way where you can't meant more Bitcoins that's how the system is designed to highlight something the whole world is going Digital in every possible way we are entering a world of virtual reality problem in 10 years time I will be ready player one is a movie about Virtual Piano social media will evolve into virtual realityeverything is Virtually everything is videos Instagram pose and all my relatives why you doing this virtual thing is not real world and it and no no hold on this will be a lot of money at some point and today when they find out how much recharge for Instagram post for YouTube video then we did this this is that happening in the world of Finance where everyone is not stick to the analogue stuff stick to the old school things these are tried and tested and the whole world of Cryptowaiting you don't know the world is going digital hold onto them will be worth something in 10-20 years yes we are moving to digital economy whatever be used in the offline world now most of the things obstructed online right when you should take online use lot of data write and in a data is the new oil if you are a country which has lots of oil reserves should be super right if you are company with lots of data companies like Google Amazon Facebook fans of data that can youdata to create profits to create use your data your own data what you are doing to show ads Nights your data in the internet what is not secured write it needs to be your data should be with yourself right that's why blockchain comes into picture and as we are moving in the world of digital some people say that a bitcoin is like the gold for the digital economy in the offline world we have gold where we use gold as a store of value in the internet world use Bitcoin as a storevolume whatever we see in the offline world is now currently shifting using this technology in the internet world right now we are using platforms like YouTube imagine a platform where you people are watching it and rather than YouTube taking the commission on the commission comes to you so that some good structure between the content consumers content publishers and the advertisers and all of the system can run without a company like YouTubeanyone think now let's talk about the individual consumer someone who wants to actually buy Bitcoin these two questions one is it safe for people to buy Crypto right now because the government Bans tomorrow what happened to the Bitcoin you want what happens to your startup and love to know that scenario also second hand laptop actually what and why people should buy it right with what intention is definitely a part of the portfolio but I also preparing for future so let's talk about a sentenceI have some extra money line ground even if it's 10000 rupees like I want to put it into what should be thinking what should they be careful about short sliding everyone should have Bitcoin as part of their portfolio simply because it's a very good for Acid to have for better portfolio diversification right now we invest your money in a lot of Markets and we don't know what can happen Cena to diversify its so that you net make Gota turns on the money that you have invented and now talking about India yes Crypto isthat's something that I also felt when I was when I heard about Bitcoin for the first time it was difficult to buy Bitcoin 9 things have changed the app that you're talking about some time back conditions goal that allows is just a matter of 5 minutes we can purchase our first Bitcoin as low as 10 rupiya do you need like you need to give you Aadhar Card details you need to do your KYC just like you doing any other platforms you do your Rob KYC verification once you are done with that you can deposit money from your bank account and purchase Bitcoin know that platform also logiTor Vipin safely no need to put it in a cold wallet or somewhere outside you can just put it in the system and B as an exchange take care of those funds whenever you want to use it you can sell at any time you want and then you want to build right you can also try to any other address that you want beautiful but again about the whole thing about government saying no we are thinking of buying Bitcoin all what happened only put money in Bitcoin so what happened is a clear trend in chips I was onApna panel with Mr Subhash Garg was a former finance secretary and they have mentioned that the understanding the government had in the past was it like a legal tender now legal tender something which is like Indian rupees the know that we use Bitcoin is not supposed to be a legal tender Bitcoin is more like an acid class that you hold and invest in for long term so governments have also started realising that it should be regulated right and the all the the RBI andgovernment bodies outside there were also regulated and recognise this is an asset class in us if companies like Tesla can invest in why are we stopping Indian companies or corporations to invest in S8 plus liquid fund which is the future of money that trend is shifting I believe that our governments will also see and try to regulated so that more companies cannot come out of production Technology and and India write a for example if India was given the opportunity to hold as mucholdest possible they would want to do it right now this is an important in front of us where Indians can buy Bitcoins that it becomes a good store of value India you are GDP will increase right India should asset depreciation because of asset depreciation are well within the country will increase is it fair to say that Indian should take a Lil bit for risk right now forget what will happen in the future put some money earn Bitcoin right now maybe the whole GDP increasing will give the government the reasonok let's listen to this India want to Bitcoin #c what happening yes I think everyone should have Bitcoin as a part of their portfolio it can be point 1% I agree with you like when you are saying that in that I was also for young was that put something in Bitcoin and there are lots of people on a platform was not invest in equity markets they believe in Bitcoin they believe that ok this is the future of money I would want to put my money into Bitcoin and and you knowtrend Risk Hai To Ishq Hai Ishq Hai To Ishq Hai you have a minimum with by walking into a lot but you are a long time I don't know whether it is going you don't know the whole world if America China Japan Australia everyone start using Bitcoin the Indian government of this is a ok everyone using it if we are well be that was economicsYaaron while there is a possibility of government banning Bitcoin government planning trip to is also a possibility of everyone going on that she and maybe at that point between the valuable 200 times what it is right now so while it's at this stage you should buy yes you should buy it and every government is regulating it right and governments will be forced to dukan technically stop buying Bitcoin and technically stop because that's not controlled by the centralit is no point bending and I think the right approach would be to understand the technology and regulating it just like what if India would have blocked internet 30 years back right would be far far behind in terms of technological and North Korea like we would be North Korea and what should be more open open to new technologies and I also feel that if we and the banning Crypto we are on path to becoming a North Korea in some way like so it needs to be needs to be legal justbut the rest of the world yes when I look at the world map at the point of Scandinavian countries is probably the most advanced both in terms of capitalism as well as just people who have great work life balance people were very sorry I was also working trip to a lot Norway Sweden places I think I don't exactly Galati but all the countries are open to get NOC India is going to be the first of India band is going to the first country to ban CryptoX ok I probably actually just want to end the basics episode right now lot more date October to the end consumers that you get the listeners in the next episode actually talked about how much money to put away which cryptocurrency is to select and also be revealing where I put my own money and how to think about that was not the actual process to water for part 2 but before we go to part 2 Sumit Bhai any lastbasic learning you want to add about this episode explain what cryptocurrency and blockchain is a anything you want to add to the sure this is a new acid class what is very very important is to understand what this is all about night I before I started messing I learnt what Bitcoin is what blockchain is how it can however decentralized future is good for the overall humanity that I think if anyone is curious about learning more about it does a platform dissonance theory ofanyone can go and start reading about it from the basic premise that the fasting once you do that a while you know you can also start taking some exposure into Bitcoin maybe winner starting with S 100 rupees see how to change housing changes and then gradually based on the risk appetite build it from there is one thing that you should also ensure that you don't put money in all the toes there are some good place out there are some bad but it's so you should very carefully choose which project you want to put money in and then will comemore about it which tokens are good with Crypto is good in the next episode of this is what is man is what the Ranveer show is taking 10 years of this nice knowledge putting it into one episode of basics shareit video shoot your friend show it to anyone who is against the idea of cryptocurrencies left foot education order not debating not anger not buy Asus lots of older people are killed in the very against the moment you C bit bit bitI hope that this podcast injured and I hope that the next one give you actual feasible actionable stepsfeasible actionable steps thank you so much you see 1 part 2
96,Cryptocurrency Special - Part 2 | Bitcoin Advanced Level By Sumit Gupta | The Ranveer Show 98,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9n8w4bxJ0k&list=PLfNW_1ECVaThQynVe4QDlBM5S6Kzy8CeJ&index=97,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U9n8w4bxJ0k/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCV1KsfLQ0t_-2jsAnWOKOxOxEVRw,top I highly recommend you check the route of you don't know much for Crypto but if you know your basics write this particular episode 1182 the more advanced side of things if you really want to become a multi-millionaire a multi-billion using cryptocurrency is you gotta know this part of the conversation and of course this could be follow-up podcast to this one it comes to the subject of cryptocurrencies for Bihar Suman Gupta once again dishing some in ends advance cryptocurrency Gyan on the issueSumit Bhai Bhai come to Part 2 of our can we show special on cryptocurrency part 1 was a cliffhanger in the end we spoke aboutthe fact that there are dangerous to investing in Crypto and you should know Lil bit but which cryptocurrency to put your money and how much money we of this one is bitcoin everyone knows give you know ke Bitcoin my money should be but this so many cryptocurrencies the something on Bitcoin gold the something called ethereum is a bunch of other ones as well as Rakhi Let The Script to export speak now through what is the strategy for everyday person like what should be thinking about diversificationlogic about put your money multiple places to be safe how would you divider money so once you've decided that I want to put money into Crypto right it's important to understand what are the acid that we should put in their 10000 plus get out there and not all of them are good what I feel is that most of these projects will fail right and therefore as a detailed if you don't have the next to identify which are the projects which are going to be successful can become the Amazon of the future in the world of tip toprespect yourself only to the topic wise which was like a win over large caps limited to Las casitas Bitcoin ethereum to enlarge cancelled large cap likewise with flex Hai market cap they have a long history they have good network effects and people trust them you need to see the carbon around for a while and gives lots of other human beings trust anyone but I remember one story so when I was you know new to the internet there was a website calledmillion dollar homepage that website used to sell add space in iPhone by 10 by 10 pixel dislike $100 right and now it's not there anymore so there are a lot of those who want to write the Hype and want to make quick money order that it's important for us and invested to restrict yourself only to the project you really understand that education comes into picture for to a college student who has 10000 rupees where would you put his money ifI would ask them to put money only in Bitcoin ethereum and what would be the divide divide majority of that can Bitcoin and and I personally follower 3621 strategy three-fourths of that is in Bitcoin one-fourth of that is any theory of their done the same but forest one very close same logic that you know you should put something completely gone wrongother than ethereum Bitcoin is there anyone you are looking out for them saying that ok they take this one called basic attention token that something that I've put my money in and the simple reason being so just like use Chrome browser this is a this something called brave browser not brave browser is a browser which doesn't which doesn't store your data will not see ads coming onto you right youyou want to see ads will get paid for seeing ads matlab ok so basically this is where can you download Internet Explorer like Chrome or any other browser is called Brave Brave browser and that is made by the co-founder of Mozilla Firefox 42 that person when he realise the power of the singular system that person made brave browser and with brave browser you can browse the internet right now if you see anything if you enter anything on your data is recorded people know ok so many things like that he likes football let show a football related atbut brave browser is like I don't want to tell you who is using this completely anonymous your data is not stored in the system if you want to earn money by seeing at right now what happens if people see ads and is just the ad platform to make money right and you know we just give openly our data that do not be the case or data should be with us only had a very interesting here on Twitter way back and statement in the Tech world is something that the Aam Janata the average personunderstand that if a very good product is free for you that means you are a product like that means that usually Google give you a lot of help in a great product product you are being sold because they are taking a dayunseeded rather than spending money on Billboard advertising posters of a product why don't we make small posters on Facebook and will only show the people who actually by yourself so brave browser and the trip to associated with brave browser so that you can right now if you look at its not some project that is this out there and not doing any real world change in this there are 10 million people using the browser on a daily basis to imagine the scale and we're just at the startblockchain technology and if it has to go a long way like you know right now where internet is internet is used in the immense power and how we can build a product on top of it similarly there will be various decentralized applications on top of these protocols which will make a data are only in which will make it super secured and you'll see company is being built on top of these Technologies what is the name of cryptocurrency you basic attention token bat batand your logic of investing in that is han these people are probably going to grow going forward yes that is a real real world product which people can use I personal use browser I do not give my data to Google brave browser has made another product call back which is the token which the underlying token which runs this is a utility token so what that means if you want to be a part of the ecosystem and if you want to something up by saying thatnow you know if we use Chrome we don't get anything you want to make money out of seeing that you can choose not to do you want to make money you can do that and the token that runs within the system is the basic attention you get paid in back yes ok so I had you have to pain baith Gaurav so as a system scales the utility of the bat token also goes up and that's a demand supply them with the demand if there are so many people like hundred million people using the platform that would be publishers who would want to you knowI want to run their ads on that Network and can only pain basic attention token and that is what the demand will come from the publicThe Brave browser company by putting your shares by giving your time earning and back is similar to that any social network that is out there you call it Facebook or Twitter any can any system can be made in a decentralized manner that is no need for a company to run at the use of a company's to manage the data you know built for all of that can be done in a decentralized minor also where the community who is the product people who are using the product are essentially the shareholders in the business and there are morecoming in that will give more value to the existing people were using the network coverage in this case if start of a businesses are intelligent everyone can create their own cryptocurrency which is the centralised which is based on blockchain technology has the same USB of Crypto token is locked in a decentralized it safe secure all that just come up with something intelligent like this so this particular brand brave browser understood that ok we will paper2cr ads from our clients in the very intelligent business started going forward if brave browser becomes popular and more people on bats and if people if the brands are paying them in bats bats will also be listed on platforms like you like me and it is already there ok invest in by 1 Rupee worth of bat or whatever amount you want to invest in god as it gets more adoption the value of bat will increase and is not just about but there aredukaan software which are solving different Real world problems like can you have you like insurance now when you take insurance from a company you ultimately trust the company was giving the injury that is something happens they will give the money now there protocols that are built where you don't need to trust was complete the system is designed in a way where if you satisfy these conditions will naturally get paid coded the future you know right now what happens when there is something I believe when is that you know 1500 years back we use to trust the word Apne bol diya main Maliwhat happened but now that is shifting what we trust like right now it's like agreements we have so much agreement now in the future code is going to be the loss of example right now what happens is in any service whenever we take any service from some company we trust the company that if something happens they will do this all of that can be coded ethereum is allows you to do the flexibility to make smart contract example if this happens this is what will happen it can bename is also called like you can program money program the movement of money these things you are making a contract in the digital world through code geass ok so basically life again take the example of the brave browser you are selling your time the computers recording has Ranveer spent one minute of his life watching this particular add the code understand ok Ranveer watched it now let's reward Ranveer with one back token tablethis is how the system inside the computer in the digital world scanning a real-world thing like your time and rewarding you with the digital thing like back based on your activity it's like It's like playing you know call of duty or pubg where you play a video game not do well that would've given in the winner will be rewarded with new things like new packs in that even pubg with own cryptocurrency in Call of Duty could have its own cryptocurrency and then you could use that sink or float on platforms like yours with a few things likeBitcoin is healing and you can pull it is a pubg Bass cryptocurrency let's think of starting a beer prices based cryptocurrency at some point but what are those of the world Amazon the world you think that they looking at something ok let's now release a jio krypton I think all the companies if they want to build loyalty within their communitiesI will eventually be a shifting to blockchain-based tokens if you see internet right now if I am browsing internet there are served in Singapore or some other country where my data goes to that server and does the computation for me now what is happening is all of these computations can be done in a decentralized manner and with that happening there will be thousands of devices in a kilometre radius who will do this competition for me and this technology blockchain technology to makehundred thousand times faster have to wait for a long time in order to load a website to download a file it can be done in a jiffy just because the internet is the centerline competition is the centralised you need a supercomputer the supercomputer can be made by millions of small small machines and they will do the competition for you know in order to run the system you have to incentivize these millions of small small computers and that is where the token can come in to picture right that the incentive structure within that communityand it is not like where you are trusting companies like Google or Amazon to store data the data is distributed across those millions of computer is just one example of us back there was an episode of Game of Thrones that was leaked if you use blockchain technology and break that episode of 1 hour into millions of parts the hacker cannot stole those millions of clips that have to have millions of computers to get the entire episode out that What blockchain provides the data super securedand it's not easy to access their of several benefits in terms of security in terms of speed other doctor provides you bro I gotta talk to you would Bitcoin a lot I got October Bitcoin mining but before that I just want to give the listener some contacts on the people who invented blockchain the news that this problem is coming out that everything is becoming centralised like that the Google the world Facebook of the world I am zones of the world holding too much power because data is the new oil their own data of everythis is not safe for mankind it is right now you are suffering for advertisers tomorrow your staff will be sold may be for something else to manipulate you may be in some ways to become a Slave To The big corporations that was a logic Gate starting something like blockchain and I'm sure that when they were the European put money also I make something called to is that the actual history of how blockchain Technology game of the blockchain technology was therelong time I think what we need to see it all started with Bitcoin so you know people didn't know the term blockchain Technology earlier the internet works versus how blockchain works like What's the difference the internet the way I look at it is one big digital sphere with things are connected all the data everything you do Facebook wwe.com and blockchain is like thislet me see in this way of What Internet did to us right internet with the internet we can transfer information from anywhere in the world to any other place right internet allowed us to transfer information from one point to another book 1 second when you bring engineering of the internet is actually cables right but the whole world is the date of the data matlab act in the Atlantic ocean that actually cable laying down in the ground of Atlantic us so we use internet very casual but actually thatupon the day watching over you are using an internet is getting transferred from America to Europe to Asia using actual cable cable OK it is all the transfer of data internet is what like transfer of data from one point to another data has the information internet allowed us to transfer that from one point to another anyone that's the infrastructure that we don't see right now you know a lot of people I feel that in the next three to five years will start using these applications like brave browser between not in a weekI will not go that much but it was happening in the underlying technology blockchain technology will just use it again coming back to that C example blank you explaining something about weblog and fits with XP of the internet or is it and others fear itself it's like so blocks in peoplecode is like wap 3.2 so the web 1.2 was where you browse our website and you get information web 2.2 where you can also react to the information you know all the social media came into picture and it completely changed things you can build communities on theright you could react what is what are the people are saying in the web 3.2 is where you can do all of that in a completely secured manner or without the need for a centralised party to run and control the can I give an example of web 1.2 was a movie web 2.2 was a movie where you can take Palak virtual reality video game that 3.5 take Badi badmash call so no one knows that ok this is Sumit using thisyou are protected from the external world and you can still do whatever you want without any without any security laws and you control your data God so basically the internet is one because your creating this digital universe and blockchain is just like your armour now everyone wants to know I am from in Engineering collegewe connect on all these random jokes and I can talk to a deeper level as well bro I have friends who have been into Crypto since every 3-4 years and a lot of them talk about Bitcoin mining what is this even mean what is a bitcoin Miner people understand between Hubli to understood what is Bitcoin mining so if you look at Bitcoin Bitcoin works on a proof of work consensus mechanism let me break the down two partswhen we talk about blockchain blockchain is a series of Anup that's a series of blocks every block has data data within it now how do you add new block to the blockchain that has to be decided by the network was item when we talking about decentralized world where we don't need Bank to control our money hear this community is this people are controlling it right so when you have a new set of transactions if you want to add that set of transaction to the previous blog that is your miningwrite in order to add the new Block with the previous long and with that how you do that is by solving a complex mathematical puzzle anyone in the network can do that if you hire computation power you can solve that first you need good machines unit Muscat to select a very high quality in computer process or something right now it can it be done on mobile phone on a laptop but now as the system is getting bigger in size unit Complex machines right and with that competition power just like we domining and you have to put in some effort to get Gold that was the value comes from if we could just get Gold of 10 year the gold will not be that much valuable similarly in Bitcoin it is a complex you have to solve that Complex mathematical puzzle to add new block to the previous block a When you add that you blocked whatever transactions are there in that block gets added to the blockchain and the system rewards you with 6.25 Bitcoins 6.25 between so you are basically saying thatthe same way that country's print more notes this is the world between the Universe of Bitcoin printing more but can't give negative after you done some work after that we call proof of work you have to do work to get that and while you're doing this work the system automatically runs were you don't need a centrist party to grow the system me what happens if this fresh Bitcoin it's never been with anyone before this is freshly minted bitcoin and every four adjust drops to half so you know19 is used to get like 12.5 Bitcoins right now at the moment you get 6.25 after 4 years this solving is called Bitcoin halving that happened in the mayor of 2020 for four years after that will get half of 6.25 and it will decrease over time but the value between is going of a lawyer what is going down the demand is going up that's why the price is born to Goa horror show in the same way that brave browser reduce book of their logical we have a product of a browserand we will utilise that they've just thought of something very creative in order to make their cryptocurrency Goa in the same who were created Bitcoin thought of this mechanism ki we will create the real life video game for the code as for the mathematician if you want to earn some of our product you work towards it then when you put it out we expect that lots of people start mining Bitcoin it will go out into the actual world and then value will go up and will keep this game with a smaller and smaller rewardBitcoin holds all the properties of a money so you know whatever money does whatever Goldust this follow the same process where you can not just create artificial supply so if you look at the white paper Bitcoin that cannot be more than 21 million between that can never be mind right now we are sitting around 18.5 19 million between that are out there in circulation and how much would you think it can go up to live for the next five years like you said 18.19 by the year 2140 all the midpoint Bitcoins will ever will be mined ok but you are time till then then after that people will continue to participate in the system by getting the transaction fee so in every so if I am sending Bitcoin to you that has to be a small fee that is paid to the minor the Bitcoin miners will get fees from those transactions are the new Bitcoins to stop coming but right now if you are a bitcoin Miner you have to do a lot oflearn mathematics problem sure to learn coding you go no it's not like that you just so there are a lot of mining pools also so you just give your computation power right or you just tell them ok mine Bitcoin on my behalf right not difficult to mine Bitcoin from small machines ok but there are solutions which you can use to mine Bitcoin usse mining pool this is a separate company a separate startup that is going to start our communities who combined their competition power to mine Bitcoins ultimately Bitcoin mining as a function of how much competition power you have Bisoncomputation Powder Room that all the computers together is it something like that so what happens is enough if you want to mine Bitcoin you have to crack the answer of that puzzle of right and its random right so every computer can create a certain number of hit and trial every second are called the hash rate ok if you can create more hashes in a second you can this higher probability that you will be the onetrack the dollar to sum of Engineering create a very high quality processes that extremely fast maybe by combining the power of multiple computers and their processes and then you have a chance at doing it like and a building a very very big machine gun using many many many guns together and then you are the chances ok if you have a big machine than your be more likely to hit the target target gets hit by 6.2 vs 8.5 which is worth how much money 630 500034plus you'll get also get the transaction fees if someone takes your Bitcoin and if you are the one cracking that code whatever transition is chosen out of the pool that will be added to the blockchain and you will get the 6.25 Bitcoin plus the face that people have paid so imagine I'll come back again Bitcoin mining to Gold mining you are that my no was taken on that one piece of gold can you take a small bit of that is of gulawat and se ok I am gonna give it to my mummum is gonna give it to her sister when my mum gives it to her sister one tiny part is a piece of gold come back into your hand and making money 5 is a lot of money to be made is bitcoin Miner the difficulty is that you have very high quality Hai competition power but there are Bitcoin miners out there like in USA not Silicon Valley is not particularly Silicon Valley the various countries colder countries particularly to generate but interesting part isparticular energy consumption is for lesser and far cheaper than what is needed to run the current furniture systems if you want to earn money the paper money it cost billions of dollars every year to the country to run the current system because a gain of like technology and power using it is for efficient way to control the hero2 to the monetary system it's far cheaper for more efficient and doesn't consumer law of the new renewable energy is currently going into a Bitcoin miningwhat you're saying you are saying that like solar power that getting from the Sun The cheap so people use that energy and preferably colder regions to mine Bitcoins man your saying like Finland aur Iceland one of these places will have a lot of Bitcoin miners my will sit there you will have the energy of the sun to power the computers it take a lot of electricity allowed when is that vary directly from the sun and in return for beginning 6.25bhaiyyu blown my brains of my head of the office next question is this and talking to you as an entrepreneur because you run A Crypto based startup somewhere in your head are you thinking of going to a cold countries in becoming a minor or having a part of conditions have a unit in cold countries are no that's not in the plants there bigger things to focus on my biggest focus is on your how can we build and shape of the paper industry in India because that is a highly untappeda lot of progress has been happening outside but India is like full of opportunities India has such amazing full of people if we can you know leverage that that's why my focuses so take us through that game and like what is that video game like that your life is one big video gallery onley games and as you said no my game is India is equipped to industries in India startup opportunity thatyes also with blockchain whatever happens so there to persuade ride when it comes to kripya is an investment whatever happens in equity markets all of that can be replicated in Crypto full world faucet is there so if anyone wants to be a part of the seeker system they can build all of these solutions and we as a company are more than happy to invest in them so that they can build that started right we can't do everything all by yourself that were going to grow the ecosystem write a lot of new status from India comes up and Milk products andwhich Indian scan used to do better investment in organised on a given real word analogy of this in a dinner time before cars were around it everything is be horse carriages and someone said that ok if your horse carriage based company today I'm going to make a horse carriage which has space 1 full family today make horse carriage with his face was one person and design Oscar and this is no I am going to make a carTV but he said Undertaker horse carriage industry and just make cooler more futuristic version with it gadi called bikes using the future cars and bikes of the world are going to be built in the financial system of blockchain and cryptocurrency is going to replicate existing financial Business Finance was some kind of intonation to check and see that We combine these two skills go into the world of blockchain and kripya and create more companies anything that happens in the current furniturescan use blockchain and build a decentralized financial system which is also called If I write because of an innocent are so many problems in the current ministers and their banks are still using the old Technology write the people in the village they don't have access to credit they have to pay 30 35% now with this the whole world will world will get connected and it will be very easy to get loan the whole lending boring space will get a walled and and you know one interesting thing is thatin the world of blockchain blockchain does not distinguish one individual from the other a bank preferred to sirf high value customisable that were the business from they might not want to serve a person sitting in a village in Africa but blockchain Technology key does not differentiate these people visit robot it's a It's a robot replacing a human being is an algorithm rate and they will not differentiate us every person will on the level playing field and with blockchain in to defy we willformer wall furniture systems examples to give analogy earlier we used to communicate by papers like in love letters for understanding handwritten notes and then email changed everything right now in financial world we are in that zone D fire everything will change people all over the world will be able to share lend or borrow with each other that they'll be able to create instruments where they can get passivated everything that happens in the current furniture systems can be moved in a decentralized mannerwhich is very likely going to be the future that happening its already happening by your grace in the like I really appreciate you being on the Ranveer show at back cubic time irrespective of what happen in our country of you go to Finland and Iceland I will come and meet together like oh my god you opened up my mind and I hope that I have taken your voice out there I hope that reaches even the Indianthis podcast is supposed to reach I am looking for creating more with you in the future bro what evidence on the online World review offline world in the blockchain world any last parting message for the listeners were gone through both these podcasts and are probably just full of thoughts right now the way I see the space it is like you know we are 20 years back in the world of Internet this space is full of opportunitiesentrepreneur of if you are and technologists if you want to do something there will be hundreds of a positive difference right in front of your eyes which can become billion dollar companies of the future bright and that is where India regulating Crypto will give the chance for these individuals to build these companies in India you know the dream of becoming a 5 trillion dollar economy can be very well achieve this technology so my message would be for anyone who wants to enter into the field of blockchain in Crypto you knowfree to learn more about it reached out to me I am available on the social media channels feel free to reach out to me I am more than happy to discuss brainstorm and see you know what creative thing can be done out of it right and because there is a lot of things in India can do in this lot of potential tons of a posse like everyday I don't want to do this but you of course there are very limited things we can do as a company so every Indian who wants to do something in the field of blockchain and cryptocurrency feel free tothis is the future 5-10 years down the line you will see how obvious that was right and that changes happening right in front of our eyes it is our time to leave rigid and build something creative out of it as a country and a back cubic time bro like this good luck to you think god bless you thank you and I hope that this 3 easy educated spree that on reaches out to would have to reach out to and at finally probably and this podcast by saying that you knowwater Tola Bitcoin investment but also India is far behind the world in many things let's be the generation that takes India of the CEO and this is one easy part like them if they are maybe 5 strings you need to attach to the Indian body and pull it off the venerable I do feel Crypto will be one of the strings in a string of content we can become a hub of content in the I also feel one other thing is artificial intelligence because artificial intelligence is a lot but I'm pretty insidehuman being capable of doing that other because we have good if you see each other so I don't want the other two links are meri man entrepreneur friends would know I didn't take any q&as on this one because I know for a fact that we will have Sumit Bhai on this show again even this one for the hindi version of this podcast god bless you brother good luck with everything and thank you for being on the Runway show thank youbhojan of this podcast god bless you brother good luck and thank you for being there and we show thank you

creators of this recent content creator generation asking about the future of contents in the 2027 a look like asked him about his secret formula for success without revealing too much in the intro allow you to sleep in the one of the heaviest podcast especially if your content creator 1 notes with this one super value added in a positive because he is one of the most positive nowadirindi show Nasir Husain namaste welcome to the Ranveer show welcome to the Indian wife love you hear I love you why was a content creator how much pressure so muchpositivity what you are the driving force for your driving force man Ranveer thank you so much with us I I tell people sometimes Why the hell do Indians watch me and I think it's because they think I'm in the end you I have the same thing about and also visit in every time I feel like I'm more Indian then Israel your American Palestinian I visited Israel once in my life I've travellednot all but not as much as you have but I have travelled in my life and is one of those places that stays with you forever just something something about your country man I can't I can't define It stays with you forever for good or bad it is a very very controversial country made the most of the country in the world but the different things right and you an alarm for the things wrong in NSIT what's unique about IslamI mean as a tourist you don't really get to see much of the wrong you go to write the tourist spots to speak to the locals but what's stayed with me is man I feel like it has this very very unique energy most people that you communicate with the I don't know whether it's because we were to listen broccoli tourist different than the rest of people people people have different energy and resource history attached to that the land as a tourist when you see it from an objective perspective it justiceTushar Tushar is have something you call the foot spa which is it just looks like it would be nice but straightforwardness you know we are straightforward this is what we mean this is why we care about if you come off as rude doesn't matter like that was his face get what you want with your own hands and I know it to some extent it's quite in YouTube and something about that from thatmost intelligent populations and I feel from a modern day perspective it's yourself and yuval Noah harari you put a smile on the map that Sab big statement that I am nowhere near as smart as you guys crazy smart it is essentially I belong to both nations in somewhere for Mix lyricsrelationship with this is as complicated as your relationship with your ex girlfriend you now so I don't know about you but it's very complicated relationship no I get it but you know something that doesn't belong to belongs to mankind in general and I strongly believe you on that same bracketIsrael and Palestine the nature of the work you doing man it's very easy for lack of a better word spiritual but you are putting out a lot of goodness out that people trying to pull you down like I know about the whole Al Jazeera thing that happened and updates on this more people than just Al Jazeera who tried calling you down I don't get why but it's really sad that someone is doing such good work is kind of food and that I guess the nature oftime in some way I think I'm taking any change in the world without drama or without controversy or without without someone getting angry like anything that is new or about to change something there is Resistance to eat like look at the app that we use today write like Uber and Uber came along so many people protested they wanted to kill Banta company but now I'm sorry I cannot live without Uber or grabnever seen anything like it as a compliment how there someone from Israel and Palestine and not make me it is well there's someone come out and talk about this for the world without going into the politics how dare they do how they not be on my side with coronavirus in Israeli I think that is actually as basic as it soundsTitli new 70 years there is Bilara conflict in social media before social media the only people I get to speak or the Brock as companies by Al Jazeera for CNN or whatever and they have a gender that it like to pursue for decades with social media now some smoke from my village cancer in his opinion and and reach as many people as a broadcast company and that is amazing that was available controversythe idea that can reach millions of people is new it's no more than 78 years old so that I love that you know again just want to interject there with a bit of spiritualism one of the books a bunch of the books I read on the concept of spiritualism says what every major religion of the world original leases treat people as you treat yourself and the other thing is considered31 a piece of the same / is no difference between Samantha in Brazil was a Saman second Nepal Samantha in Japan vs Samantha in Alaska it's all the same and on the other hand we have social media which is polarizing people which is making everything us as we all know grayscale so am I mean I feel like we're entering some dark times before things get really positive it like thanks to content like yours thank you gonna like Jay Shetty people are willing eventually become positive butdark face before period you think relations came unify initially yes I feel that way back all the religions at the same things I feel like and this is kind of what you all sources and knowledge books that initially the goal of religion was always good and an over the years religion became a power game so people near the top of those religious sects and let's change of this rule and that in that roleOLX tell the people that this rule actually means this and then that we can you got twisted over time so one of the spiritual is a books that I've read also sells its controversial think this is in about 2580 to 500 years from now will not be any religion itself will be like the one thing however in the whole world is gonna follow one kind of thought processyou pray that might we pray Taraweeh like the first followers of his new religion will help them like my new video my newport as my new image add a new product doesn't like it will make another videothat every single person has a God in their life that is called different names of some people is the algorithm some people it's Krishna bhagwan some people it's you know their diet if they put that died the forefront everyone is something you get offended because of and there's probably what you call god that is true that I don't want it's such a pain that everyso I would like it I would like to change at some point I want share holders to be my new God what do you know what's what the next 20 years of your life looking like according to a used and right now in New York someone who doesn't seem like you plan to for head but why would you like like to take you 20 years question is which were plan for 5 years at the time butgenerally speaking you know as three years you some queries enjoy being creators should I just enjoy being informed the camera and it is make one show every year make a mini box in holiday Villa with attended many awards ceremony is possible that said I've never actually been a from the camera creator I think this is the second new new idea I've always liked it off behind the camera trailermy next 20 years at same I would like to make NAS daily work without Desire so my name is my name is this I would like to become a big thing without relying on me which means by default you have to the company you have to find teammates you have to build an organisational structure with accounting hiring video making dough making partnerships Tak everythingso I will be fascinated with the idea of 10 Nashik Arabic many people may not know but it is communist but if you like my videos are always about people who was always the last few months so many people so is this person this person this person this person and would like a nice group in an experience like to be also the coffin as group which is the people group in which we create products we create organisational institutionswhere it empowers it that are there are good for the world so for example we have not to use right now which is a studio company of production company that create content and its great it was continents it helps brands it makes money then we have not Academy which is it is a very empower individuals to become an Academy themselves if the technology platform available right now which we think to grow with the very big in the future and in the next 20 years ittop 10 hotels in US towards na spawned na stop I think that's my 20 year can fly go after that I think meaning I will lose meaning I will lose meaning in company is a loose meaning in product I will lose meaning in profit and loss statement accounting knowledge but I will not like the private sector in more and after that I think the public sector become is an interesting place to be and because that's where you can have to changeMaryada powerful but that was even more powerful is the person writing the law and serve I think between private and public thing that's usually turn off where I see the pursuit of meaning is and politics at some point I think it's not something that's like exciting but it still if you look at the options I have you like if someone says I truly hate the way the world live right now in IndiaI truly dislike the traffic in India at 5 p.m. I truly dislike it what can you do changes that with the question that must come down it comes down to ok you can make a media campaign against that you can go a volunteer and raise awareness about you can be the cause that moves it faster little bit smaller you can build better traffic systems available make more infrastructure given to the realistic at some point you realise the matter what you do the problemhas not been fixed the only actual solution to the traffic problem in Mumbai is a freaking governor of the president saying they would limit the number of cores starting from next week ok bye bye no more than 5000 cars on the road at this point of time great Yuva Limited just like Singapore done so I think I'm solutions actually exist much more on that level rather than on the on the on the groundno that's gorgeous plus with biohacking coming to play people say that anyone who are a Jumbo 93 your born in 92 lift at least 2019 193 and then it's the question of how far do you want to take care after that so reserve weird questions to ask someone until the reason I'm asking you this feel when you are born with this blessing that all content creators are born with which is violent creativity where you're thinking of new ideas all the time you want to doalien things so do I am also thinking about something in a parallel tangents to what you're thinking that thanks to the blessing of creativity that you and your possibly born with the question is if you get a chance to lift the age of 200 in a healthy body would you want to leave that long can change the world for X200 use another question I've ever been as a question for the if I lived to the age of 200 it means that everybody how r MedaI am the only one living 200 everybody 11200 your call group listed 200 at least with my call that a big difference I don't wanna live forever every person I meet you are you die if we see my kid I know I'm gonna die before my kids I would not have that sadness and I will ever be able to be emotionally attached my kid if my entire core group list watch 200 I would take it would take it in a heartbeathan han because then I can start making much bigger butts right now the bats were taking on my cannot paneer so dear 50 years Max what is what can happen if years wine tours great what is I am living out of 200 then for sharing a bi vi the state on almost right now change the value today for sure right to study the future lot because I anticipate that as a constantly to you do and speciality for yourcontact I am sure you studying the near future now I'm sure you win answers 11 questions about the pandemic but what do you think this next decade is looking like during the dark decade you think the decade felt like you know you should have you found her on the spark that I had I had my father what's 8 months ago and it was over the top rated episodes with dead because The only things about that write The only things about hi hi booksbecause its Traffic Racer tell you how the future is now look like I generally think in 5 years of 2008 junction between half years I don't think too much about how the the the the the the the long future looks like I feel like we're going so fast that you need to start looking into is your chance to I think the next decade is one of the great you am so excited thatreason for the next decade is gonna be amazing for the top 40% of the world is give you really Siri for the bar on 60% of the world so I would say if you're listening to this in India you get a mixture you make it to the top 40% because I think a lot of jobs can I just disappear and I don't think I don't think documentsIndia or even Switzerland aur America will be able to keep up with the change and a lot of people before I generally speaking I will be poor but they would not have something to do with other 40% you had something to do when you have a lot of fun doing it what do you think I mean you know you why we can't predict every single industry I do see a rise in content creationand consumption all over the world in Netflix invested 21 billion dollars in just the last you on the content and it still not kept up with the demand in terms of how many new shows People watch how many people watch over the next 10 years if you give every single human being the weapon of creativity I feel they will find a job either within the field of content of applied learning from the field of content in other jobs for example once you learn how to run a YouTube channel you want titling thumbnailSearch Engine Optimisation you can go work in a digital marketing company you can go work in an app and help the US because you understand consumers that much so if equipped to the weapon of creativity I do feel that their kind of be a little more safeguarded for the future and I also feel that whatever business you want to launch content creation is good to be a part of that business over the next 20 years so you might as well know the abcs of Ages the way we learn mathematics in school creativity and contentshould become certain connotation is because it could be articles it could be poetry it could be the only thing that it told you School that ok do for fun but does not make you money no no go back to that loan how to write essay is loan how are you doing I don't need that it is sohonestly it will work it if you are killed by Now listening to that also in storytelling still to this day does in equator job it is not equal to job at all I remember a few months before I started NAS daily my colleague call me hate you want to come to this story telling class in your for $400 and as it is for what I know it jokesI didn't know that storytelling is what can I make NAS daily succeed and so I think for people it's our world then you to make that connection between storytelling class to making money as a job much clear because right now still very very very faagi that's what you're trying to do with the Academy was launched and I am also working towards building some kind of infoideas you set up doing the Indian versions of that like a sort of Indian version of it but the big the big ab I feel uneasy field is exactly what you said education in the bridge between working on the creativity and making money at great for the world yes exactly that's why I think right now the the way social media platforms have built which is it is 50% you keep 50% or a million views and give your Fun box are you joking that I have made a Minipeople interested in this video is your platform could have evaluation of a hundred trillion dollars and you're giving 5055 on the box and with in India you give me to have a box that was so I think at some point the valuations of the social media platforms will be shared to the creators at some point the next question of course is what the future of social media using the rise of Clubhouse it's an app that coming up in the stateNIOS upload my own domain of engine timing great on club house but I think about it will take off Mein we will grow you know what is executive Sushmita vacancy and other Tik Tok sad Revolution I believe when virtual reality comes in everything unchangeable the world is gonna come ready player one amazing ready player one no not yet but I know that I mean when was really comes to a person in Indiaperson in San Francisco with 50 million dollars in the background with virtual reality comes to a person in India become the foldable man all production Studio Jagan have so much fun is a great that it is restarting right you you you you you stop text Studios you you kill the with normal video Studios and you will new Studios you literally have like it stands for a well in a creation of moral with this new industrycreative destruction that for example right now everything is ok all money although there is 1 trillion dollars in value in oil that means if you are in a sustainable industry next solar or wind or whatever you are about to get a one trillion dollar versus value transferred to you from this company was conveyed I to you in 50 yearsexciting to see the transfer of value from industry changed and if you can guess the next industry like you can I get more so that transfer of value in cell width of this forget me excited for sure as to exactly what that platform is going to be an AC no one knows that it's very very difficult to know like a Snapchat Tik Tok vigo based on cycles and if you like in news goes on 7 days are caused by I care about something withstate capital via 7 day in entrance I think the world has to social media like 5 year insurance Snapchat was Google message so I'd rather not look into the fluctuations of this year and next year it was a look at the the general trend of words and capture some that value would have thought of over the course of my career some kind of frustration sometimejust again violent creativity thought of the fact that some creative should the get together and build the next social media platform where is more create a friendly I mean if we are talking about that gap in the market why not an asset area 12 biceps and Abhiyan new Jay Shetty get together and build out like the next Big value adding platform it is died and I feel that something was the next and use this isn't doing rightwarm up for that this is that my dream kind of goal in life I not yet the next Big Tech products and don't say Ocean Indian buildtech product again it's a product of the world is a product of the community talking about you know it was let's make it off again yes so funny I know that it is coming up I thinkvinati I want to issue is the supply of content or the demand for a new platform I want to do what is it that drives people to hop onto a new social network coronavirus for a worked on an ideal like this with summary everyone has failed startups one of my fav start of something like this and the place we got stuck at was the supply of content which we actually solved but that process would take a lot of bandwidtha solution to it that stage of my life was 6 months ago it would take a lot of money and a lot of my own time and energy but I didn't have time for because this podcast was taking off and I feel like maybe you know when I am more financially equitable do that much more easily so that the problem was the supply at least from what we had kind of gate to get will be right quit 6 the supply you know they had so many shows that had read the billion dollars that soshows arm that this was in there wasn't good enough I don't know what it is I definitely think that we Snapchat the reason Snapchat took off his is or stories is that they meant for ephemeral 24 hours is gone content was Hai Snapchat was a supply was created Ribbon app and I was wondering if anyone knows Tik Tok was I think that the man for short content that makes mehappy was Hai Tik Tok was there was a fly I would probably look at what is the demand for in the future and all the supply for that rather than putting beerbiceps experience with you if I go on a different platform right now ko Apna SAP 30 million followers AP have an internet 100 thousand welfare 129.99 do not give a flying them becausethe man for that thing so I that generally the way I look at it Pessimistic on that front of you make it work I am all yours no I mean I don't intend on the basis of the social media space I do have some solutions that kind of spoken Assam6 people and that figure out a way to make it addictive that what Tik Tok and and algorithms an expert at making the experience addictive right so if you if you interact with the curve for 15 minutes of 11 interacted with the Furious commented on something out with something the algorithm was so sharp that it knew exactly what to show you in all the main character and that's why all the Tik Tok loans couldn't keep up because they didn't have the strength of the algorithm that the Tik Tok ko team had onecolleges as a part of the Core Team shots were trying to figure out how to make it more addictive all the time so I feel there is a solution that is about the right brain is coming together it's about a lot of teamwork but maybe 5 years awayYouTube Instagram Facebook with what we currently have added disposal what's your Vibe about content house Convent evolving I tell you how is revolving in India is becoming a lot Daku in a fun way you know people get offended with human it is actually kind of an offensive and some people look at it is known as to Evil our I kind of look at it as a fresh change I'm not seeing a good often people hurt but sometimes dark humour iswe need to just take itself too seriously the question is what is the evolution of content for social media platforms and support separately and if I knew I would be sitting at 50 Billion Dollars for the value right I don't know making dresses we all strive to make bets on the world 5 years ago I made one baith the battery said was I think software engineering Manati for meFacebook videos can be very big in the future and nobody thought Facebook videos with the thing over here but Facebook everybody YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube sorry but I don't care by YouTube and is about what I care about is I think Facebook good work in terms of a video part 15 is there are now we have Facebook watch now have 90% of our worship and exposureFacebook and 10% coming from YouTube and its working quite an amazingly forest soap to see it happening is TV becomes YouTube TV that so you to become cpu2 becomes Facebook because without video platform rather than a place to share with your friends Facebook used to be a place to share with your friends it becomes Instagram Instagram never people share with friends on the stories Instagram itself will be the place to be visit valve adjustmentyour content becomes Tik Tok and so on and so forth for change one thing is the over it moves part 111 TV dies it was the first to die then YouTube is next die then Facebook Instagram and serve that's why right now we are building up on InstagramPathan Chinchwad operating frequency and usage so that when Facebook ties popular doesn't were ready for the next YouTube which will be Instagram in admin I think that's the evolution of social your wife and I could be wrong but you know it's another better to take another thing I would say that can happen in that only social media platforms and change universities are gonna be radically differentmade for byju's and online education content is gonna be unbelievably use like I cannot even fathom how big is can be because the University of Wisconsin is my can I make any money man University of Karnataka for Mumbai may not last it's so expensive to pay can your professor it's expensive to clean the god that building you know and built it is well songwhat can you take this forever can I take in general over the brick and mortar places where you go set and have someone takat you is most definitely gonna die just as much as going to Goa taxi and and having a thank you on the road that can I die happened this social media platforms will empower causing creators to become universities on their own right so I care less about University of Wisconsin I care more about UniversityRanbir you know University biceps that's what I am sending my kids I am sending my kids to India's water spot to learn water so that the big bad so what you said about creating that thing coronavirus which means people in Arabic with creating something which is the Indian Parul is called big brain company with the same intention that I remember back when I was in collegeeducation we get in Champa Indian causes it AIMS at the top layer is like when less than 4.1 % of the country will go 99.9% of the country goes on the other colleges and you did you that ok maybe there's a spectrum but that's not true 99.9% of country does integrated education is the professors are not well paid before the tracks The Wrong times of processes that that's just the lack of teaching and you do need a certain level of teachinglife's true people it's really through reading it using this was 90% education happens through people through watching videos through live interactions that's why our Big Ben Hai Building a partner's Academy is primarily A Life Education company rather than just be recorded the you go watch it whenever you feel like it so I think that's right now I'm gonna cry if a few minutes if you made 5 hour long a video aboutlife the completion rate on that is going to be active for person to person I'm using the completion rate on on my contact if you see someone where you live with that May actually be 89% and is about the education is about completion rate not purchase rate in the most severe we have sold 5 million courses great at what percent that was completion ratein in in in Ace Academy and in other universities know that stuff so beautiful inside man Mandira this is the future of social media is live streaming IPL batting baby steps in that direction but I completely agree with you that China's usually one or two step ahead of the rest of the

religion you don't see that so seen Hindus burn dead bodies and and and and throw in the Ashes in the river for me is backup big mind as you know much like how is this possible why are they doing this and is this out and you know I was there I get ityou are whole new set of different policeman academic Vijay brothers this video is it your Season 8 install Unity dead body floating down the Ganga river for me was like wow where is a billion people but believe something I don't believe in that sweet open my eyes to the idea that you're not really nobody has dances I may not be as right as I think I ammaybe the naraj white as they think they are accepted for the earth let's celebrate with the traditions of self celebrate with my traditions coronavirus Cruise in Goa with our lives but you know that before that you think you are right you coronavirus in you like oh my god this is next level with the right you know the way I look at it and this is a gain back to the debate betweenmediators have been all my life and I don't vegetarian about three years ago and feeling both are constantly at the constantly like it is reality for human being a subjective you believe was right and wrong based on your perspectives so neat would be food the someone and to be dead animals to another human being in your heart we feel something right then ok find that might be right for you is not votinghuman beings you know your not treat people as you would want to be treated that the most important rule of life and everything else is subjective this don't Hota the human being physically mentally emotionally and spiritually that they become vegetarian because because of religion or because of help or because of animals also partly because when was I got to dogs 10 years ago that was started takingover the things also just like this in beings that we should stop eating meat and the primary reason was meditation man like I married a lot and so in India that the blessing about being born in this country you have access to good meditation schools so in the gym you know that is a technique the and how you lift weights particular kind of exercise it does something your body their techniques in the mental fitness and meditation for which you need to learn from a proper SchoolIndia has access to 100 schools like that with all of which are good 1000 which are not good Badara 130 good so I mean I just all the school kind of conversion and that idea what they said that if you don't vegetarian will be better for your meditation you will be able guddipa your meditations and the nature of our careers content creators extremely Rapid also if you take on entrepreneurship as an added challenge you lifting a very heavy load complete the averageand figure that hold of a one we believe that load I need to have a really strong mental muscle I saw the meditation help in the mental muscle and anything that area the meditation would be my go to so that the very tired I never had someone say that before that as the reason why they became vegetarian do you think it became president you last year was not similarly reasons but my reasons were slightly different is like I only do what I need to doI don't know I don't do anything I don't need to do I don't need to buy a different t-shirt so I have 20 of the same t-shirt I don't need to show up to someone's got your ever so I don't go to do I need to do so that I don't need need to kill a fitting animal just to determine if I don't know I can I can flower flowersAam jobs in anything has an added benefit to be honest I did not feel anything right now Aisa get tired I told I tell you are hungry I still don't meditate I don't feel the difference but I did but when the heart is yours better that they can I can I can I be rude in of the Earth due to meditate just because I know you someone with big machines in life man and adjust it gives you that added weapon you knownot have that magically charge stored with you to do yoga and meditate on the time I've never right now I have not sold enough I may be sold in 5 years 10 years solved in after that it for me but it makes sense at meditation dixon like and meditating it wasin the form of an experiment width of the power of the back then and I thought and I read that helps in muscle recovery of thing is my goal that you let married but you really see the bed with only a month into it so until you're gonna put your body through out for a month for your mind full form and you won't even see the difference to be honest with you I am a Lil bit scared of meditation because I know that's right now the energy that I have for NAS daily andreason I work on acid of the time is because I know so fake Itna screwball size of faith that doesn't make me give you happy making money doesn't make you happy building company doesn't make you happy that I was a fake dream a dream and I think that meditation would make me realise is overweight and would make me focus on the things that don't actually help you your career so you know such as you know many more time with friends and family been happygone along with you I want I'd like to continue believing the lie for the next year and this is just me sharing my experience I had done I was ka experience was 22 years old a familiar with what I am so a life-changing Aladin Mein hesitation about doing it back then was exactly what you are saying I don't wantlet go of my career and I want to be tougher than a Sham in back then I told me that will only give you what you need and that's why I realised that does 2 games going on inside you ok one is the purpose your born with which is what your doing through what are you doing to NAS daily it's your purpose that what you are going for a life you have that what your mentality with that purpose you have a mission in life and nothing usually shexi of it but the second purpose usedonly have to have in this is just something on loan from both the world meditation and Pixar Movies all with a highly recommend everyone it's nice nice nice one it's it's about getting high in the present moment yes you find Hai is an everyday I am enjoying right now I am talking to you and that your teaching me just with even though as the ability to be in that present moment and derived juice out all the drive from the present moment is what Marathiyou so it won't make you at least in my experience I have the same issues as you did exactly what you said you are scared about you losing a bi to your career the focus I personally didn't feel that this is not be convincing you mad at me with that I am doing thisthis and I also hear you talking about how you feel is Facebook that something I felt as well like at one point as we know all this is an images to virtual its numbers and then kids road to me about how they didn't commit suicide because of some piece of content we need three years ago but forgotten about when someone else route to me

you can't generalize is good one the bad ones this particular God man guru was what I call my aim in life the word Guru literally translates to the person who brings you closerthe light was dark and Angry child getting fights I was very not yet in one study lots of temporary shoes because my mums family followed Babuji directly go to my mums ancestral home and spend time with him when he was visiting Bombay experience the very early form of meditation that thevitamin into the room that he was sitting at the lord of peace and somewhere in my heart I felt just like in the X-Men you want to

for he looked back at me and give me a smile and I felt like a smile contained a lot more information than just happiness and felt like he was saying more through a smile specifically remembered as one time where at Dunexample the mermaid taken Nirmit it and for some reason after that meditation session in my heart I want to look up at him I didn't asking for better marks in exam asking for one thing in my mind I said I know you can't give me better marks Apna in your hands will you give me the ability to work hard the moment I finished saying that centres on myhis eyes open he looked at me

definition of prayer for me you don't ask for specific you ask for the ability to endure what was thrown away and trust your abilities enough to achieve those specifically yourself with or without prayer but with knowing that God of the universe some higher powers looking after youyesterday we recorded a detailed podcast with Luke coutinho any spoke about the concept called providence providence the something you only understand after having achieved something in your career it could be some financial goals it could be some variables providence basically means knowing the power looking after you at every stage of your career at every stage of life that throughout my life I live my life for the sense of providence only after speaking to look that Iabout that word is my teams as passenger from my beerbiceps seen that is it weird that I always wanted someone like you in my team only came into my life lete your robot coming my life my life would be easier but I probably wasn't prepared in our as a leader to give you the right kind of tasks or comment to you correctly and easier than ever there was no problem given my version of providence I never even really watch

back to Goa place where all of it started so what's what's that when I was your lockdown when what's the LaRobin like for you my love dance been amazing know this respect to the people who suffer through any point in life if someone's feeling good in doing good dasamanada sites offering call saintly and say that you know bad right to it's been great It's been great to work with patients who are not recovered through ko will be seen patients is a lot of learning and the amount to be blown through covid-19 covid-19 happen it should not happen and itsI think it is you know tomorrow people who are dying of starvation the numbers or more in the amount of light entering diabetic 3 million deaths a year in Oregon done 0.001% of that cancer that cardiovascular holiday due to know when the media shows these numbers in skillsphere in oven exact value 6 segmented and Break It Down two numbers or not as bad I Vishnu and iPhone covid-19 exist it has to be learntit's you know when something bad happens we can wallowing in self-pity we can never be stuck over that I look at it is what can be learnt from this what is shown as the importance of Vitamin D3 which is always been ignored importance of lung health importance of a few of diabetes is not ok do something about it make it better with your job you can just beyond medicine se I am fine because today these are the cases which are being hurt the most took over the storage that on the technical front number 2Sona stupid two populations of people people lost their jobs peoples business is crashed his one population that slipped into depression and another that have made new businesses you know same problem different mindsets here are some people who lost their jobs and is it will never go back to work if built online businesses new revenue streams to see if taken if taken difficulties and challenging times and have converted it into profitabilitywhen you life my perspective mind change my set strength took over the product so much should be good for the world in terms of pollution and so many different things is made as all realise how vulnerable we are in a weekend or medicines worked ok so we turned back to nature return back immunity became a password in a before he was never even discussed for 5 years we will screaming immunity immunity immunitychange to bring out the best of what is actually real to us in the basics of the basics of human life is immunity you are low immunity you can get any disease I think Lok dance Bin fabulous fabulous another so we can take away from it right now adding the two things that came to the forefront the first was alive feel I feel different people have different levels of you inside the ear and you got to see on friends a girl who are the ones who live here for lifebus who are the ones who just go for that one thing the king and the second in the king the forefront from a professional sandpoint because of a life that point is mental toughness in people and I know that the narrative of the last five five years has been about mental health is important that we will be touching up on that in this podcast is well was not spoken about in a Khuda say someone called David goggins was not spoke about his mental toughness that's going to be the neckbig thing in the world we called it mental fitness in the past I have mental toughness and mental fitness on the channel for this reason that the moment you say oh be tough people think that an attack on the conversation of mental there another not often as mental fitness is all the more reason you need to stand with this point because what is mental awareness aware that depression is at its highest were aware that suicides 13 age problem adult problem senior citizen problemswhen is not connect Excel mental toughness is going to fix yes I am sad now you can do about it ok not disrespecting that your sad robot action are you can take O yes my girlfriend my boyfriend broke up a Si empathize with you no one likes order but now you want to do you know say stuck are you know what you need mental toughness Elite yocoin in the word Metro fitness you needed for mental when is useless aware of their motionanyone who isn't a way of their emotions the thing lacking is action that stuff then of moving forward left and right when we say you got stuck open beta people are called because your emotionally weak you have to be emotionally strong weakness cannot be accepted it can be worked with yes betan accepted that we need to move to after become accepted and do nothing about it in with creating a failing model in society will be will only get the year what you wantyou went to a breakup yes he should've done that she should have done that your Congress ko chocolate go number pain by U no smoking a joint drinking alcohol no you create a mentally weak society with you need someone to say yeah ok you know go home feedback go to the feeling but tomorrow get up and move on with your life is difficult no one is saying it is easy to do it needed a very small section of a Bin audiencesthat really really highlights the darkness of Mental Health and hold mental health conversation I want to highlight that I know this is about your story and I know that it has been a part of your journey through the positive side of things that's not a part of your life and you highlight often I'd love for you the highlight some of your own dark times as well in this conversation and right before you do that again our god highlight David goggins menthrough Joe Rogan and Joe Rogan podcast that has a catchphrase David goggins easestay hard and that's why it's so important especially in the model you know if you like nothing before covid for even during the lockdown he promoted the idea of mental toughness you had the intersection of open audience is coming at you and saying that how dare you say you know where all the problems are in that open audience emotionally weak and unstable when I sayin this respect the way I am your the correct the problem I am your vacation in front of media only thing I see is your recovery in that you are becoming an obstacle to it's my job to break it down if you want to break it down at your so all the people who can say you know you need to be compassionate yes compassion and toughness go together but you see all the problem is when people attack you from a particular standpoint and social media what those are the audiences that have problem you can sleepNIC and I know you're on the right path keep moving forward to stay hard ok is a fantastic race but you know alot groups are gonna say like that to Dallas TX to rough but it's the truth and most people on honesty in the truth but you know where it can we take it on relationships I want honestly can't take it when they get honestly you build up quite like you will the world because you want to satisfy your partner emotionalwhere does the easiest thing for a guy or girl is the be yourself and be honest with you take it to stay hard is great the people of the seat in the perspective of yes we empathize you have a problem in this regard in the pain you are going through but you are thus a heart that you never used a float right there with them and that there is Bima online trolls on those roles in general doctors in haters and life people only point out the negatives abcDev you something negative or that the like for example the most common I am sure you get this because you are associated with the world of fitness someone somewhere I will be criticizing something about you your knowledge your body that somebody put themselves in criticizing their knowledge and their own Body project in their project in the in securities on you and trolls basically everyone tries a defined rules that covers tell you why again cover is a word ok and if someoneChunav upheld the ka Karva I want to know what power that behaviour was and change it positively vitrolles because they know they don't come face-to-face day attack and a project no face to face they will never be able to protect them securities on someone social media is given a platform to people the hide behind the screen and project because if you want to give constructive criticism you can still use the platform number samajh trolling is a very very deeply rootedin 10 project and other people ask me to you gone through it affects us why you should affect you know why because the brain works on survival anything that threatens our peace our happiness our safety

beautiful position in IBM I have a lot more time to pursue my studies and nutrition but one thing that happened to if you are not pull me out there would still be in the struggle of the corporate ladder where to see Purnia of the struggle with identifier that I didn't see a struggle for me it was micro tractor race tractor race OKtoday meeting pretend you understand numbers and stuff like that

Lifestyle junction my career I want to get the nutrition pediatrics integrative medicine all of these things and I said this enough all of this happening in the world but no one is teaching people Lifestyle how to live how to if you busy award you need to dobaby busy successful but keep your health is the game changer my life Ranveer I take Lifestyle got into Lifestyle medicine integrative medicine everything together and just fill the gap that no one was feeling no one was telling you honestly adjustment flowing through life and wherever I see a dark and I feel if I forget that can be impacted jump into a I don't even look to see what can happen stuff so 2 months eyes are searching patients and staff and I said when was preparing our2000 rupees a determiner Sar ok 5 + PDF + all this shit one lakh in my client insults that's the time I leave ok overnight I realise why am I so feel about this I know and good my clients are increasing and changing their lives in Safai centimetres to resign and see what happened Association Of My Life from 100001 auto like 10 lacs the next month to 15 lacs like you know it's just a few you overcome fear so I know Ithink of a story I had a great chalkar everyone in the family were my parents for but it's not even a damaged because of that I am happy I saw it I can relate to other families as well and realise that fighting is real people at different but what you can learn from that my parents were still together you learn to forgive but that is a family be grown ups in forgiveness happened maybe that's very logi connect to the subconscious love you didn't know about me at this point but I have exact reflective ParulAdidas outlet in Goa with family kids brothers and sisters be still find amigo of the Year se my parents as a Goa ok Nau I left home at the age of 18 and I'm going back for you want and staying with them there are going to be difference is adjustment staying effort with my dad several times over this one year of the by dinner time were fine and it's so healthy you know so I think the so much when you see today that open audiences to speak about what is a fighter jetmeans you know I mean this respect kaun se some people needed but what are you doing the figure it also has the word project a perfect family to you that doesn't fight a perfect relationship with people don't go wrong that the production of the world as were the suffering breeds from the child who has always been told you are beautiful your the best and step out into the real world and give about you and your No 1 and and and andno one loves me not appreciate me emotionally weak society ok brain The best brain society Bilimora ever and suffered at love your child but when you need to discipline them you need to disciplined and Inter College spade a spade as part of a bringing you know so I think I'm not going to struggle to our Dark Side Of My Life salute we have done my share of staff and whatever I can tell you if I had not done that there would be who I am it is a lesson to takeanyone not done anything bad that way but as we grow up all the parts of a farmer share of Broken relationships where I am broken them have to time everyday gone through it ok yes maybe I should not cause the pain gives a lesson what is the lesson ok your actions caused hurt small lesson everyone deals with me who was I at that point vykunta be satisfied with this relationship in love yourselfrelationship with curiosity it was wonder it was fun and all of that stuff but accepting that today makes me more mix so when I am able to handle relationship problems of my clients and tell them it's ok it's ok don't think you messed up everything it is OK to you bring up your girlfriend on your bidding of your husband that happens to ok but it is a problem if you don't want to fix a don't stay as simple as that willsomething you need to try and fix that you make up your mind no one can change that walked out everyone you know you want to have bright and Dark Side now you want to grohl writer sedakait was dark and everyone can be too good all the time this this this this this is why you in my life struggle is Mumbai traffic because I am in Goa I don't know if it's me 2 hoursI can see like like four patients by patients and what not to do with it a chance forever with specs and Goa right now I don't know about Mumbai traffic struggle right now while my my immediate solution for that problem in my life is ambrocet in my ka number make content on this record myself doing something that the immediate solution but you know from everything you said the so many aspects I wish to highlight the available listings a podcast right nowrelationship full episode of this before ever go back to the theme of this podcast which is mental toughness right to say something control contribution that might get me the some trouble seeing it in a very general way you highlighted this whole aspect of the purpose and psychologists who dedicated the entire life to helping people and mental health issues they know about the human mind way deeper than peoplebut and correctly on role I am asking this question I'm not making any experience do you believe the human mind is a limited enough for someone to take all aspects of input inside text book because a possible I personally believe especially the psychology student the spoken of used to installing and Mumbai University the very arrogant about the stuff they read in the text books for example I know that there's a Textbook in Mumbai University that actuallystand up calls meditation falls in cosmetician fake has not won Naval Ravikant says that not look it yourself but not on my experience has taught at some out-of-body experiences in meditation I have seen my on mental health get better over time through consistent medication Aisi my mental toughness increased to meditation I feel that experience is the biggest Teja on a similar with my own subjective experience but I don't believe that psychology textbooks complete encapsulate the jobI have made some fantastic psychologists some fantastic therapist will learn through the experience of coaching and mentoring other people likely that would teaches them the most but never limit your perspective on things because of the textbooks are you friend textbooks are guides that is ko baccha Medical Science ok anatomy is my favourite subject but it gives me information and knowledge on how your heart works what will happen if your triac levels go upclock in your brain is great as a benchmark ok anatomy in a book you are better book structure is right everything is good but you are constantly changing ok just because anatomy se as that of clock will happen in the age groups of 50 to 60 ok doesn't mean we start looking at it only a when your 50-60 it's a process that is started probably win lottery because you have low vitamin B12 you not your sleeper examplebook is great but that's why it and now for me I want to know how can I prevent o'clock from coming in your brain Jungle look beyond that but just because science is looking beyond that they have been put the pieces together doesn't mean you are wrong the psychology as a Process is a book and all of that stuff but your brain is constantly evolving and changing every second ok how can you just 1 textbook knowledge andPureit into a solution for your brain and your emotional problem ok I'm going to divorce it's the same thing accepted start going out start doing a starter no you how are you changing what role did you play in your own suffering that make you feel better all the time by taking responsibility out of you when it comes and depression even an analogue people were the president like when I say this is your

decision but all these studies of fitnesslike Arnold Schwarzenegger you know all the tc.gn case study in principle of progression ok more protein more progression more muscle and I have muscle build a principle which they believed in and they went through this you think at the start of Arnold Schwarzenegger's career in had as many studies as we have you see a notice another thing a lot of people

this field everyone around me couldn't believe that I can talk like you know Medical Science why do with the day I reflected on this what changed the day I was inspiring itna busy dream I want to be this way no health professional absolutely not you know what I realise that this is my truth because my brain can't seestation I can you get the most complicated problem in my brain will try to simplify it so I can understand it to you come with me with a ton of reports on a ton of symptoms my brain is going to look for the simplest things that could have caused this and build on it and that My Savior and people and willing to accept that that the complicated problems can be that simple all my computer cases amena medical doctors and it produces ruk the complicated cases solved by the simplest solution for Activato accept the truth I am your tell you today that your forum only balance not you is because of sleep deprivation I am telling the truth now you're not wanting to believe it doesn't change the truth to the people who believe it they like look my endometriosis has disappeared I don't need surgery Inayat genius no I just told you something which makes sense to me which is the truth which can also be backed by study example rupee to won a study that I need to sleep well oksuper me I have taken a weakness which I thought was always a weakness and that became my biggest strength my biggest strength from ICAI for comes off the complicated Business expansion plan ok I just tell him simplified and five Bullet points and it makes sense to me do it if it doesn't make sense I don't want to be involved in it I only put the complication so that honestly my only thing that's why I always say it's never a struggle I mean it is locatedstruggle and made it into something which is super super beneficial for me and you know you keep saying I'm positive that how is mean by mistake se scene of taken away with that I can't change to main got hurt in the process of I can't I can tend not to do that again but I can only move forward and see who I was at that point who she was at that point the patient was that point and will the new story of it so technically 2020Manisha Chokdi Sattu bhaiya that point I got selected for interview I went for the disposition interview but I decided to put the higher position as a team leader ok I got selected and everyone who is the heroine of the year of experience but the truth is I got selected by move the higher position to Dubai from Dubai to London from London I came back to India from Dubai how is going with the flow didn't know what I want to do until I finished 10 years in IBM that's when life hits me and I believe thatKitni with health professional my 25 have failed I don't have maturity I don't have drive and want to make that might think we believe life push me to this journey which is zero dep as a look what you started this when you were 24 I said I would be successful I will not meant to do this the 24 is a time and place for everyone in life for everyone I grew up in my dad telling me that they don't have a push your time before is a time and place it is planned it is written you can't changeyou can change the things in life and today I would change anything in my past all I want change anytime I definitely want to ask you a lot about your business journey because I believe that the same mindset that you used to this deep into the world of health you have used it to some extent in your business careers in your professional life but before that I just one highlight three things that I get from your journey the first is that your forever load that's the mostthat's your biggest strength also an attitude that that something very underrated in the modern day it was especially when you are in a scientific feel like medicine no engineering you always told in college that if you want to make it better to Kurnool crazy about the process of learning is kind of made feel full for a lot of games but when you actually Get On The Real World and you begin your learning process you realise this I figured out when for example if you thiElon Musk creating specific heat or terms of rocket sides and bottom with Joe Rogan is explain Rocket Science in detail in simple words that ok this is what you need this is how I figured it out and you realise that even something as complicated as rocket science is just about great in the learning process that one even had bought you I lied about you is probably something you don't give yourself an upgraded form which is may be genetic may be due to childhood experiences a great communicator great orator which againI probably got selected as a team leader and the third thing is again the highlights of the learning process but it's a coat of Steve Jobs that stayed with me on my life Steve Jobs at the one code changes in their life is at the moment you realise that the entire world was created by people no smarter than yourself is where everything changes for you where once you realise that you can create a world that works according to your rules that may be the changeunit of the balls to think that way I think unique cause I know you are on the side like a lot of people say look you know I say I am the best in my mind I have to be is not an arrogant way you know people around me can we be better I can learn from them all that but when I am treating a patient if I don't think and the best in my mind however the cancer patient have to be the best in my mind open to learning not the best that I know all that that thattractor trolley Bharti thinking the best and that no one is better than you I don't have a people that around me and I can learn from them when I am reading some one I have to be the best in my mind was why would you put your life and my hands if I am not the best in my mind so it comes down to your mindset the end of the day and absolute and I think I've been blessed with a lot of luck I've always been lucky some people says your lucky summer you know I think it's worth me honestly I even have gone out of life I told you relationship this that whateverApne Pradhan anything wrong intention in even the worst things in my life that I shouldn't have done my intention was never negative never the harm someone never to like it if I to time the girl and tell you honestly right now I don't care what people say if it's because I didn't know how to say no to the first girl you know I don't want to hurt you and I know you are you are you want to find out I just do it today when I look back ok I don't like confrontation of the learn how to be ok with confrontationmy intention was never like ho I can get laid on both side I can get this was never never die and ensured by believe that my luck or whatever you do know you call it is come always the case is Din pure intention behind everything when people say hey how you are lucky I just think that I never had a bad intention is never been so that might believe it doesn't have to be a people story this is my story is my belief that what I think is worked for me I think a lot of people who looked up to us you know a lot of I keep telling myfollowers don't try to be mid meal working for me you may want to take away one thing from that but don't try to be me a role model in my life I can't be that person can take over a little bit from you know who ever my role models are a little bit from Mike Tyson a little bit from example would like I wanna be like that you can't take that isaccording to me live boils down

layer isyour level of domination this is something I've been teaching my team and lot because I saw it as a missing link in a lot of people within it domination is the spirit of backing yourself going after things whether that you're giving you all too relationship or you can alter your career mixed with domination in your learning process that cheesing loaning going behind learning with everything

everything right why not everyone on the Sadakmisalignment of how you take that an a-line most people run when I asked them to manifest if you ask me to explain manifestation in two words with no work we had I have a multiple sclerosis patients who visualise coming to see me and reset one year later Walking Through the future when she came came walking walking stick that what works for me visualise I saw myself pressing the button getting in Walking Deadthat's the thing I visualise every single day for manifestation is two things 1 no crystal clear what you want that cannot be no I want to be rich what is which team is it money is a BMW Yacht is it then there is a love in your you after 20 so crystal clear and then you are staff feeling like your already getting it the how will back sit in the most simple way visualisation manifestation is crystalgold stone age people strong relationships what kind of guy one beat you up everyday you can get hard working guy who's on drugs and alcohol used to be so crystal clear about what you want and then start living a life you got it that how can I feel when I got this partner how life you when I have a million dollars in my account with PC most people are accumulating and not feeling that that that when it becomes in gratitude and the cycle brakeso if you ask me these things are real my entire life is built I told you I never visualise to the age of 34 35 when I started seeing the power of us today for everything in my life is visualised every single thing in my life is visualised because I have a crystal clear vision of what I want and the things that I that I don't get when I look like when I get this I wasn't sure what I wanted to say I want to be traveling the world doing this distance travelled in New York London Dubaicrystal clear and how am I going to be an island in Vietnam and have 100% waiting for me to be changed at Aisa to living the Dream every three months New York London Dubai Singapore going towards a wait list of patients crystal clear all I did was changed to change anything and study more to make the dream happen I have the skills I just didn't have clarity of thought so got absolutely the power of prayer unbelievableyour parantu refuro liebrecht on press it cannot work without faith and belief that they Run with your printer Universe You are embracing a tree or whatever it is with faith and belief again its intention connected with thought clarity and the feeling that you are gonna get our faith and belief that we provide even mentioning religion without letting me know so many people who can provide all the time mind this way but it had become a Sunday mass everyday I go to temple 5 time I say 5Python software during the day and stuff like that available and distressed and anxious I say if you bring so much what happened to faith and belief your support the surrender your promise how can you pray for your school write a micro manage your problems is it ok to drink the right way showroom blame blame the process which we will watch what you're doing something I cannot control what is giving effect to cylinder rateIOS for guidance I known to be taken care of if I can do something to the effect that I have to surrender it but rather control something if you can't is the most it is a drain of energy and something that you can never never every so we have to know clarity I can control this I can't control is what I can't control and I am 100% sure I cannot do anything about it can't do anything about it okyou cannot do one thing I can do that the family together make the last few hours comfortable for the patient you know that the 1% I can do that I can still do something about it I can't change between new which is feeling hour by hour no one can change that 1% you can make a difference analyser is always something that can be done to s.bi patterns and I don't care what people think you know he was a Roman Catholic but like you saidJesus did it but it doesn't matter to me and myself taken what means to me and I made my life story of it so I don't care what people think it's my life my favourite was working for me it working for me that my Pak border me what's what someone's opinion is a product of some people come but you can know this is connected with this have you seen this this religion and of course the Vedas a beautiful the Quranbeautiful but it all comes down to one message kindness compassion faith belief service any debate any of that isn't the same thing I said that for me that were then its simplicity why you complicating at why do you need to complicated you need to the same message every religion is written on my question to you is what are you doing about it are you chasing complication are you studying the practice what every religion is boiling down toSubah haisiyat sorry I don't know from religious ritual yes I have failed to I can I say every point in my life today is because of what I have done have been guided you know there are times after my team so many times after spoken to a client that wasn't me talking why should I take credit when I know what was the I am being guided what to say to a dying patient of a patient who were you ever been train no textbook taught me that is a forcethat's telling me this is mean of spiritual Guru in our gift know it's just that I am open to receiving Gai Taran think now like you were chasing learning all the time if we put upon it was receiving when we open do it was even like I tell you why most people fail in meditation that trying too hard that trying close my stop my Tok no meditation is about close your eyes and receive baby today you won't receive anything in the session tomorrow be open to receiving power and energyreceived you can't change it to meditation what people fail in I can't stop my manifest meditation just sit down receive what are you receiving in the was 5 minutes to hours 10 minutes and then take from then will do whatever you have to do so you know these are things which you know people see in different process with an awesome and study and failure analysis proven I want to add your lost universal life time and then you are there in your life you find thatstudy was wrong to the next time you use your intuition you forgotten Singh Science can never explain even surgeons ok use the gut Instinct anus surgery if they go by the textbook that if this happens you do this no I think out of the box to use get instance and that this a while I had to go back on the textbook the patient dies and every surgeon know that every pilot knows that there is but instead with science can't explain it is a mysteries in life which we should respect we should never ridicule if you don't believe inmy new reticulate you know your only interrupting the energies are also guiding you but you are to blinded by your own ego in your pride and confusion in your mind which is why I can meditation is so important for SSC clarity like look at you different from other people doesn't mean your better than other people different different is greatnow the same energy access what you are taking and Honey Singh that energy and making our faith ok is what is making who you are you know you who you are today everyone getting the same energy everyone for your wishes stress is not bad stresses in energy is what you make of it is what you relate to that you would 5 people in a room with a problem some of them were serious tress some of the more serious challenge Samay peoples no big deal the same problem but you babywith baby Hona set India coming on my left right on the water surface then it's it's that's how you know my whole point can be the reason I like doing contact with us because it's real continue this respect but we are finite time to give 45 minutes to listen to a podcast I want impact on your about stuff that they may be niceI love social media I feel sorry for a lot of so-called fans and I wish they could change and understand that BF Pan don't idealize some what are you doing with your extraordinary life you are going to die you are finite time ok don't use beat is gluten fan on social media for everyone on a pedestal what are you doing with your life people don't understand unlimited potential talent that they have a locking that energy following oneplustryna be like them loan will your life loan build your life so I take away from the best doctors the best nutrition the best people all of the and building me and building me 12 people are taking action to be better than this person in the world but everyone is not enough there is so much so much they changed the perspective is after change your lifelove you may like you don't know how much like I mean while I'm grateful for what about social media careers giving me this is what I am most grateful for social media whether I feel for them and their proposed I said do not people people on a pedestal ok respect them on a damn appreciate them with the moment you put them on the best way you look at yourself do you feel you need to lower yourself you don't have toyou don't have to do that at all in all religion it all religion worship me that it is useless if you are not taking my teachings and putting out to other people don't just come on Sunday mass and touch my toes and kiss me if you are going and treating your brother and your sister and your society badly you don't do that false religion and so beautiful that so beautiful I see that happening on social media people like trying to be what aboutPramod time unique talent that you know your blurring yourself away from me when you find a people did you find your passion I go searching for that I found a gap I felt inclined towards it became at the sample is that there is no strategy around finding aid you like something it first give it your all of your function so much passion to be cooking you love cooking you have a passion you have a passion already you know so I think simplifying things is what keeps me the happiest because I thinktemperature at this point in every aspect I do agree with this that God talks to you and I feel I feel free to surf to my daughter was 7 years old she is not to say that generation intelligent beyond beyond all souls day and a very different generation in a Shilpa Shetty never talk near today because AVN Hasan piano almost the same agent user groupgeneration is going to be the change we need a change and I can see if I can see your heart and they like so so intelligent in a different way and a good positive thing to see if the balance this work has to drop also with social media and everything that I think as a society metre guide them in the right direction be on social media production of you ok put your picture on social media but that's not the real you is you are you happy are you happy when someone gives you likes on Instagramkeep asking MP3 reflect I am happy right now it's worked at this stage in our life bro you know to make them think differently to them they make you think differently right now you know you maybe this is but they will go to drugs they will go a good deal I went through that I can affect everyone started join my dad se Dukh for semi smoke a joint smoke with me I went tojoint with embossed the thrill of it happening that he took the trailer of the whole thing is no big deal was a joint everyone who is in ban from a join behind acrylic white smoke two joints in my first and second joints of light at the end of the day is by some cigarette smoke from the role plays and nownothing is foolproof tomorrow She Goes and prices cigarette I do know she will try I am ok happy Shivrajpur I know she will not continue to process because in the subconscious mind right now to be can only do the best we can the best we can become everything we do canopy foolproof at all and staff that you are experimenting with my daughter white reach the world to make it work the way I want to do it you know I'll give you an example with Rihanna when she was about to turn to and all the parents around Velloreready for A terrible twos it and trees and normal and my mind definitely your story doesn't have to be my daughter story and Safai that to date the honour 7A remember 110 from for something stupid Natasha maybe about 3-4 tantrums in staff always been a brilliant partner will be at second of thinking to what everyone said when manifesting it and the tantrums what we went in with an energy that this doesn't have to be a chartwhen everyone out there who edited with teens will come Holy Spirit Of Your inviting all that stuff that doesn't have to be your kid doesn't have to be ok why you inviting that why you manifesting something which is someone else's story in your life it doesn't have to be that way your story can be different and how many teenagers are there out there who are stable VMA lights like you and takes just right through people thinking at their stories with Just Can't Get Enoughthere's not strong enough you become a victim of a projection if you are strong enough liked your story and can be different and so even if my daughter into the terrible 3 and deal with that point to start thinking now of a problem that me never exist in my point simplicity stay away from anxiety which is not required for taking right now I'm not exaggerating man like this is some magicthrown into this content please like it's just the fact that I get to be a part of this thing with you just a question

was the first time I picked up something from you and I was dealing with a lot of related issues because I had just gotten into the world of fashion base contact us16 image to win at that point the energy of the phone and salt happening during my first information when this was happening was that I go I felt extreme anger towards that Businessman who looked up to now by the way I followed that guy on Twitter and thought I realise it is more to him and this is one aspect was in securities are use protecting and you can go to In The Way You handled it kind of just Cool Me Down but it made me more self confidence of the observing that the second time I met you in person which was also the firstprovided with euphorbia biceps by Tum so much from you even of camera in that but what I picked up with the most was your sense of belief and how you said that you had spoken to billion as I was then what is common between between knowledge and belief and I think that's the point on my career

something anyway nice really starting to think about changing India and you can even if that means you have the capability to change Ok now adding a number to it ok doesn't change the fact that you can't change you change one person in your life like Bruce Lee size you want a perfect Act 11000 times the first take perfect April 2009 so you are impacting 1% I me when I say I want to change the world that would for me is not like every single computer world is it if your sitting in front me right now that my world right now I change you I think someone else tomorrow and that would build up the entire the mass of the world but going out and the change in which I would not have faith in but if a patient for me at that pointTori Manasvi happy me is my world is nothing else that's why would I change my life changed the world but change definition of what to do this to me to when you say my my daughter is my world ok which means you know at that point where she sweet whatever she is my world is also sometimes we need to take his words and redefining according to what we are so they can I say I am changing the world today I am changing the world by definition to world doesn't have to be what other people think I'm changing it won golden timecriticisms that our team receives and we talk too much about changing India but does genuinely because I believe that begins with the belief that one would think that big for the other people say ok with vacuum and different point you know why do people have a problem with that because they don't want to change you know once I had a patient who came to me ok to lose weight and diabetes incidence that I know this I know this analysis should do thissister sister and plan if any Residue need to do whatever you said you should be

to me after live in an reply to a message still the prescription is thisTumi Hatta action what you need to do a spade a spade at some point and stuff like that it is too many people talking out there but not applying not applying an overall all that comes and goes self worth as well as you are you Eclipse in the lower shelf with your sense of Internet in the extremes remember people want to move into extreme perfume important they feel empowered Dekho I am Vegan and I am this I am no PapaI respect you do it quietly you know I said this in a treat and you can be part of the word I said there are people who literally themselves Central census by overriding over consuming on over dieting over exercising and when they want extremes to solve the problem ok if you were consumed on Ok no fat is not your solution okyour solution if you were consumed fad diets going to an extreme that is not your solution achieving balance is your solution is a good things nofap all that stuff make this world a consumer unit is become spiritual Guru of know when you are consuming phone like 8 hours a day and now you move from one excel to another loan self restraint not know fabric button extreme extreme the easy but restraint like I want to watch phone right nowsurface when I don't do it and you neural circuit in your mind by nofap unitary developed anything else over time yes you may do it it show me self restraint and discipline now in the moment but your empowering yourself with an extreme mechanism which is not sustainable which is not sustainable the basis of Kamasutra is balance ok you are you are not like screwing and making love every single night the beauty of Kamasutra is a preparation towards thatLenovo conversation gestures giving off flower cooking food at your build up that your foreplay to the main event and stuff like that I am in your shaking every day and all that stuff and when you want to choose an extreme and that becomes your self identity that becomes aware that sunao you feel special not showing people that you over consume something before for extreme is not a solution what about people my happiest people ok or nonfat diceexercises dangerous and whenever they want you doing all the pieces and a happy who is extremes better than balance is the debatable was it is a sense of you know identity and write their own and say that this isn't the Hai Twitter

to Ranveer start me comes back in the normal which is homeostasis you know their bodies and stress mode in his Rhythm extremes and Notre Dame is this how many these people in extreme to become a people should be happier people but they more aggressive and angry and stuff like that with the intention is wrongsimple question Sangeet Khandelwal asks how to maintain consistency life simple but profound question beautiful question because every like the two main ingredients for achievement at anything else is discipline and consistency for consistency is likely already doing it right I believe your brushing your teeth every morning reduction system ok if same thing something that is important to you if you are unable to be consistent with something that means you not assigned enough value is not important to you don't put yourselfmake important first then becomes consistent and brushing your teeth is important to you and your mouth smell to you do it consisted yes become a habit because when you do something consistently you become the habit of your health is really important to you ok also become motivated to work out because this is not an important first you can't keep motivating yourself everyday but if you make it important to automatically find installable assigning values to whatever it is that you're trying to be consistent with a signed it valuevalue and start doing that you fail a couple of days get back on that would build consistency over time OK I will slightly can your health and maybe brain related quiz today Neetu Singh ask I have dreams every night when I go to sleep I never get a good night's sleep and how to solve it is there any solution to having dreamless If you stop my dreams so how to increase the on the bench is nothing wrong with dreams but if you can remember all of your dreams in the morning that means you not on the deedsthat's why or possibly feeling tired and 50 throughout the day in what happened is definitely meditation or deep breathing or left nostril breathing before that helps you to move there are you are Alpha waves your beta you are theatre your Gama to move into the right phases of deep sleep and deep sleep is when is dreamless venue offers may not reached at state and we reached it is probably even if you just a few minutes but your deepest place so you can remember all of your dreams are not sleeping deep enough doesn't the dreams are not bad for what is your environment before you get that youVinod 2 your deep breathing and Pranayama coronavirus on social media that keeps thought process going you not get your waves of deep sleep products that are very common thing is nothing to worry about but you want to fall into deeper sleep using these mechanisms at problems a look into looks and real and you might you might find some Pranayam related diseases ok Samrat Singh Rajput is quoted my tweet chances are there any tips for students in school or colleges for Law in mental healthany advice for mental health for school and college students ok so my question again if you do have a genuine mental health problem ok fine but really is your problem a mental health problem as a known that societies define few that you are made a problem because I can't argue with 3 Saturday is because I have to study is a truly a problem or is it something that you should be sacrificing if you want to achieve something a lot of so-called mental problems are not really problemsit because it doesn't match with the norms that society has given by now I should be in a psychiatric ward definitely because I will go on weekends I don't like chilling with people and friends are very small circle Suman people say true but you are this famous person you don't whatever you know it is because it doesn't make me baby doesn't make me feel like I have a mental problem you know so first be honest with yourself is your problem truly a mentalif it is if you need help take it away bad it is number to my mother my most important point is remember right now that you are responsible for solving the problem is when a health coaching mentors recharge to people your parents communicate all that stuff being in your own little bit will not solve your problems but not only you can solve your problem where you can the medication is doing its job balancing your serotonin your dopamine over it is but finally you have teaI am beginning this problem and begin this problem so if taken state on the Moon export as may be what these problems are we can face I am mentally depressed I don't have a girlfriend positive edge why you want to be locked in at 18 years ago explore your options learn from everyone I mean you have a do you have to be with one girl right now no 13 if you enjoy your life as your mental problems with everyone else has a girlfriend ok you feelmental problem with different your time is going to be different for you so if you truly have a mental problem then do whatever I told you be honest this is truly a mental problem own label things because once you label it it becomes The Way You Live every single day every single day become the way you look so someone calling you stupid all the time and you accept that you didn't feel stupid even the most clever person should only use labels is not necessary if it's a mental health problem possibly specify nextMeenakshi
